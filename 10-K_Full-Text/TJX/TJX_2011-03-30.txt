Cautionary
    Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This

Form 10-K

and our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders contain
    “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for
    the safe harbor from liability established by the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including some of the
    statements in this

Form 10-K

under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
    our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Letter to
    Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.”
    Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks,
    uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Such
    statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future
    events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current
    facts. We have generally identified such statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “forecast,” “intend,” “looking
    forward,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “project,” “should,”
    “target,” “will” and “would” or
    any variations of these words or other words with similar
    meanings. All statements that address activities, events or
    developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the
    future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, or Exchange Act. These “forward looking
    statements” may relate to such matters as our future
    actions, future performance or results of current and
    anticipated sales, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange
    rates and results and the outcome of contingencies such as legal
    proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations
    expressed, anticipated or implied in any forward-looking
    statement will be realized. The risks set forth under
    Item 1A of this

Form 10-K

describe major risks to our business. A variety of factors
    including these risks could cause our actual results and other
    expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results
    or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our
    forward-looking statements. Should known or unknown risks
    materialize, or should our underlying assumptions prove
    inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past
    results and those anticipated, estimated or projected in the
    forward-looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you
    consider forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates on
    which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to
    update any forward-looking statement, whether to reflect new
    information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
    however, to consult any further disclosures we may make in our
    future reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (‘SEC’), on our website, or otherwise.


PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel
    and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide.
    Our over 2,700 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of
    quality, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally
    20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices,
    every day.

Retail Concepts.

We operate multiple off-price
    retail chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe which are known for
    their treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values on
    fashionable, brand-name merchandise. Our stores turn their
    inventories rapidly relative to traditional retailers to create
    a sense of urgency and excitement for our customers which
    encourages frequent customer visits. With our flexible “no
    walls” business model, we can quickly expand and contract
    merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing
    tastes. Although our stores primarily target the middle to upper
    middle income customer, we reach a broad range of customers
    across many demographic groups and income levels with the values
    we offer. The operating platforms and strategies of all of our
    retail concepts are synergistic. As a result, we capitalize on
    our expertise and systems throughout our business, leveraging
    information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and
    developing talent across our concepts. We also leverage the
    substantial buying power of our businesses in our global
    relationships with vendors.

In the United States:

—

T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS

: T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    (referred to together in the U.S. as Marmaxx) are the
    largest off-price retailers in the United States with a total of
    1,753 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired
    Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including
    footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative
    accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We
    differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product
    assortment (including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and
    accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J.
    Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering
    and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls),
    in-store initiatives, marketing and store appearance. This
    differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    encourages our customers to shop both chains.

—

HOMEGOODS

: HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is the
    leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the
    U.S. Through 336 stores, it sells a broad array of home
    basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall
    décor, decorative accessories, children’s furniture,
    seasonal merchandise and other merchandise.

In Canada:

—

WINNERS

: Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading
    off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The
    merchandise offering at its 215 stores across Canada is
    comparable to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. In 2008, Winners opened 3
    StyleSense stores, a concept that offers family footwear and
    accessories.

—

MARSHALLS

: In March 2011, we brought the Marshalls
    chain to Canada, with six stores planned to open in Canada
    during Fiscal 2012.

—

HOMESENSE

: HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 82 stores
    with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods.

In Europe:

—

T.K. MAXX

: Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced
    off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major
    off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 307
    stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland as well as
    Germany, to which it expanded in 2007, and Poland, to which it
    expanded in 2009. Through its stores and online website, T.K.
    Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls
    and Winners.

—

HOMESENSE

: HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to the U.K. in 2008 and its 24 stores offer a
    merchandise mix of home fashions in the U.K. similar to that of
    HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.


A.J. Wright Consolidation.

In the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2011, we announced our decision to consolidate A.J.
    Wright, an off-price retailer of family apparel and home
    fashions primarily targeting the lower middle income customer,
    by converting 90 of its stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or
    HomeGoods banners and by closing the remaining 72 stores, two
    distribution centers and home office. We have increasingly
    improved our ability to reach the A.J. Wright customer
    demographic through our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores and have
    seen these stores perform well in markets with these
    demographics. Consolidating the A.J. Wright chain is expected to
    allow us to serve this customer demographic more efficiently,
    focus our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger
    businesses with higher returns and enhance the growth prospects
    for the Company overall. For more detail on the A.J. Wright
    consolidation, see Note C to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Flexible Business Model.

Our off-price business
    model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size,
    allowing us to react to market trends. Our opportunistic buying
    and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to
    adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than
    traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our
    stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. By
    maintaining a liquid inventory position, our merchants can buy
    close to need, enabling them to buy into current market trends
    and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying
    close to need gives us insight into consumer and fashion trends
    and current pricing at the time we make our purchases, helping
    us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our
    selling floor space is flexible, without walls between
    departments and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can
    easily expand and contract departments in response to customer
    demand, as well as market and fashion trends. Our distribution
    facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving
    and shipping broadly ranging quantities of product to our large
    store base quickly and efficiently.

Opportunistic Buying.

We are differentiated from
    traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality,
    fashionable, brand name merchandise, which permits us to buy
    into current trends and pricing. We purchase the majority of our
    apparel inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion
    inventory opportunistically. Virtually all of our opportunistic
    purchases are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices.
    Our merchant organization numbers over 700, and we operate 12
    buying offices in nine countries. In contrast to traditional
    retailers, which typically order goods far in advance of the
    time the product appears on the selling floor, our merchants are
    in the marketplace virtually every week. They buy primarily for
    the current selling season, and to a limited extent, for a
    future selling season. Buying later in the inventory cycle than
    traditional retailers and using the flexibility of our stores to
    shift in and out of categories, we are able to take advantage of
    opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts
    that regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the
    highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace, such as
    order cancellations, manufacturer overruns and special
    production. We operate with lean inventory levels compared to
    conventional retailers to give ourselves the flexibility to take
    advantage of these opportunities.

We buy most of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with
    some coming from retailers and other sources. A small percentage
    of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced
    for us by third parties. Our expansive vendor universe, which is
    in excess of 14,000, provides us substantial and diversified
    access to merchandise. We have not historically experienced
    difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory
    for our business in either favorable or difficult retail
    environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate
    inventory as we continue to grow.

We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for
    the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an
    ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are typically
    willing to purchase

less-than-full

assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging
    from small to very large; we are able to disperse inventory
    across our geographically diverse network of stores; we pay
    promptly; and we generally do not ask for typical retail
    concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown
    allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to
    stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges. Importantly,
    we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an
    excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.

We offer our customers a
    rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
    “treasure hunt” experience in our stores and spur
    customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory
    in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of
    apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized
    inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems,
    coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling
    and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our
    stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve rapid
    in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell
    substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods.
    We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory
    replenishment determinations centrally, using


information provided by specialized computer systems, designed
    to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined
    manner. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing
    activity such as sales or coupons. Over the past several years,
    we have improved our supply chain, allowing us to reduce
    inventory levels and ship more efficiently and quickly. We plan
    to continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of more
    precisely and effectively allocating the right merchandise to
    each store and delivering it quicker and more efficiently.

Pricing.

Our mission is to offer retail prices in
    our stores generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty
    store regular retail prices. Through our opportunistic
    purchasing, we are generally able to react to price fluctuations
    in the wholesale market to maintain this pricing. For example,
    in a time of rising inventory prices, if conventional retailers
    increase retail prices to preserve merchandise margin, we
    typically are able to increase our retail prices
    correspondingly, while maintaining our value relative to
    conventional retailers and preserve our own merchandise margin.
    If conventional retailers do not raise prices to pass rising
    inventory costs on to consumers, we seek to buy inventory at
    prices that permit us to maintain our values relative to
    conventional retailers and sustain our merchandise margins.

Low Cost Operations.

We operate with a low cost
    structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus
    aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Although we
    have enhanced our advertising over the past several years to
    attract new customers to our stores, our advertising budget as a
    percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional
    retailers. We design our stores, generally located in community
    shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping
    environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend
    heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution
    network is designed to run cost effectively. We continue to
    pursue cost savings in our operations.

Customer Service.

While we offer a self-service
    format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
    helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver
    a positive shopping experience. We typically offer
    customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of
    payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. In
    the U.S., we offer a co-branded TJX credit card and a private
    label credit card, both through a bank, but do not own the
    customer receivables related to either program. We are engaged
    in a store upgrade program across our banners, designed to
    enhance the customer shopping experience and drive sales.

Distribution.

We operate distribution centers
    encompassing approximately 10 million square feet in four
    countries, which are large, highly automated and built to suit
    our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially
    all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution
    centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by
    third parties. We shipped approximately 1.8 billion units
    to our stores during fiscal 2011.

Store Growth.

Expansion of our business through
    the addition of new stores is an important part of our strategy
    for TJX as a global, off-price, value Company. The following
    table provides information on the growth and potential growth of
    each of our current chains in their current geographies:

Segment Overview.

As of January 29, 2011

,

we operated five business segments: three in the
    U.S. and one in each of Canada and Europe. Each of our
    segments has its own administrative, buying and merchandising
    organization and distribution network. Of the U.S. based
    chains, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are
    managed together and reported as a single segment and HomeGoods
    and A.J. Wright each is reported as a separate segment. As a
    result of the consolidation of A.J. Wright, it will cease to be
    a separate segment during fiscal 2012. Outside the U.S., chains
    in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and StyleSense) are under common
    management and reported as the TJX Canada segment, and chains in
    Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are under common management and
    reported as the TJX Europe segment. More detailed information
    about our segments, including financial information for each of
    the last three fiscal years, can be found in Note H to the
    consolidated financial statements.

Competition.

The retail apparel and home fashion
    business is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of
    fashion, quality, price, value, merchandise selection and
    freshness, brand name recognition, service, reputation and store
    location. We compete with local, regional, national and
    international department, specialty, off-price, discount,
    warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell
    apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell,
    whether in stores, through catalogues or other media or over the
    internet.

Employees.

At January 29, 2011, we had
    approximately 166,000 employees, many of whom work less
    than 40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary
    employees, particularly during the peak

back-to-school

and holiday seasons.

Trademarks.

We have the right to use our principal
    trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls,
    HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense and T.K. Maxx, in relevant
    countries. Our rights in these trademarks and service marks
    endure for as long as they are used.

Seasonality.

Our business is subject to seasonal
    influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the

back-to-school

and holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales
    and income.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The statements in this section describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully, in connection with
    all of the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The risks that follow, individually or in the aggregate, are
    those that we think could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking
    statements.

Global economic
    conditions may adversely affect our financial
    performance.

During the recent economic recession, global financial markets
    experienced extreme volatility, disruption and credit
    contraction. The volatility and disruption to the capital
    markets significantly adversely affected global economic
    conditions, resulting in additional significant recessionary
    pressures and declines in employment levels, disposable income
    and actual and perceived wealth. Although there have been some
    recent improvements, continuing or worsened adverse economic
    conditions, including higher unemployment, energy and health
    care costs, interest rates and taxes and tighter credit, could
    continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary
    consumer spending adversely and may adversely affect our sales,
    cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, renewed
    financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets could
    adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of
    liquidity available to us and could increase our pension funding
    requirements.

Fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and
    earnings.

In addition to our U.S. businesses, we operate stores in
    Canada and Europe and plan to continue to expand our
    international operations. Sales made by our stores outside the
    United States are denominated in the currency of the country in
    which the store is located, and changes in foreign exchange
    rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these
    businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting
    purposes. Because of this, movements in exchange rates have had
    and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our
    net sales and earnings.

Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging
    instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our
    international segments that is denominated in currencies other
    than their local currencies. In accordance with U.S. GAAP,
    we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make

mark-to-market

adjustments at the end of an accounting period. These
    adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is
    significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a
    significant impact on our earnings.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can also increase the
    cost of inventory purchases by our businesses that are
    denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the
    business. When these changes occur suddenly, it can be difficult
    for us to adjust retail prices accordingly, and gross margin can
    be adversely affected. A significant amount of merchandise we
    offer for sale is made in China and accordingly, a revaluation
    of the Chinese currency, or increased market flexibility in the
    exchange rate for that currency, increasing its value relative
    to the U.S. dollar or currencies in which our stores are
    located could be particularly significant.

Although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk
    management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in
    earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
    exchange rates, we expect that foreign currency fluctuations
    could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and
    results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our
    earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our
    hedging arrangements fails to perform.

Failure to
    execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management could
    adversely affect our business.

We purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and much of
    our home inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing
    close to need. To drive traffic to the stores and to increase
    same store sales, the treasure hunt nature of the off-price
    buying experience is enhanced by rapid inventory turns and
    continued replenishment of fresh, high quality, attractively
    priced merchandise in our stores. While opportunistic buying
    provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and
    prices, in the quantities we need and into market trends, it
    places considerable discretion in our buyers, subjecting us to
    risks on the appropriate pricing, quantity, nature and timing of
    inventory flowing to our stores. In addition, we base our
    purchases of inventory, in part, on sales forecasts. If our
    sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may experience
    higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or
    slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins, or
    we


may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading
    to lost sales, either of which could adversely affect our
    financial performance. Our pricing model requires that we
    purchase inventory sufficiently below conventional retail to
    maintain our pricing differential and margin, which we may not
    achieve at times. We must also properly execute our inventory
    management strategies through appropriately allocating
    merchandise among our stores, timely and efficiently
    distributing inventory to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix
    and level of inventory in stores, appropriately changing the
    allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to
    respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and
    markdowns. Our vendors and others in our supply chain are also
    subject to risks of labor issues, financial liquidity, weather
    and other natural disasters, economic, political and regulatory
    conditions and other matters that could affect our ability to
    receive and provide to our stores acceptable merchandise in
    adequate quantities on a timely basis. Failure to execute our
    opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well
    could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with
    our customers.

Failure to
    continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely
    affect our financial results.

Our revenue growth is dependent, among other things, upon our
    ability to continue to expand successfully through successful
    new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store
    sales. Successful store growth requires acquisition and
    development of appropriate real estate including selection of
    store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
    attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
    negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable
    sites, increases in real estate, construction and development
    costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our
    ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future
    or adversely affect the economics of new stores. We may
    encounter difficulties in attracting customers in new markets
    for various reasons including decisions to open new banners,
    expansion into new geographies, customers’ lack of
    familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with
    local customer preferences and cultural differences. New stores
    may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing
    stores, and new and existing stores in a market area may
    adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability.
    Further, expansion places significant demands on the
    administrative, merchandising, store operations, distribution
    and other organizations in our businesses to manage rapid
    growth, and we may not do so successfully. As a result, we may
    need to reduce our rate of expansion or we may operate with
    decreased operational efficiency, and it may adversely affect
    our results.

Failure to
    successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet
    customer demand could negatively impact our
    performance.

Because our success depends on our ability to meet customer
    demand, we take various steps to keep up with customer trends
    and preferences including contacts with vendors, monitoring
    product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping. Our
    flexible business model allows us to buy close to need and in
    response to consumer preferences and trends and to expand and
    contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’
    changing tastes. However, identifying consumer trends and
    preferences in the various geographies in which we do business
    and successfully meeting customer demand is challenging, and we
    may not successfully do so, which could adversely affect our
    results.

Our quarterly
    operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and
    may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’
    expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at
    points in the past, and they may continue to do so in the
    future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at rates we plan
    and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’
    expectations. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts or investors, our share price may decline. Factors that
    could cause us not to meet our securities analysts’ or
    investors’ earnings expectations include some factors that
    are within our control, such as the execution of our off-price
    buying; selection, pricing and mix of merchandise; and inventory
    management including flow, markon and markdowns; and some
    factors that are not within our control, including actions of
    competitors, weather conditions, economic conditions, consumer
    confidence, seasonality, and cost increases due, among other
    things, to government regulation and increased healthcare costs.
    In addition, if we do not repurchase the number of shares we
    contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase program, our
    earnings per share may be adversely affected. Most of our
    operating expenses, such as rent expense and associate salaries,
    do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult
    to adjust in the short term. As a result, if sales in a
    particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter, we
    may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that
    quarter, and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a
    disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter. We
    maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and
    align expenses. If we do not correctly forecast sales and
    control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results,
    our financial performance could be adversely affected.


Our future
    performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand
    within our existing markets and to extend our off-price model in
    new product lines, chains and geographic regions.

Our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets,
    to expand to new markets and geographies and to attract new
    customers in existing and new markets across demographics. This
    growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or
    different categories of merchandise within our existing stores,
    continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing
    markets and countries, expansion of these chains to new markets
    and countries, development and opening of new chains or
    potential expansion of

e-commerce,

all of which entail significant risk. Our growth is dependent
    upon our ability to successfully extend our business in these
    ways. If any of our expansion vehicles does not achieve the
    success we expect in whole or in part, we may be required to
    increase our investment or close stores or operations.
    Unsuccessful extension of our model could adversely affect
    growth and financial performance.

If we fail to
    successfully implement our marketing, advertising and
    promotional programs, or if our competitors are more effective
    with their programs than we are, our revenue may be adversely
    affected.

We use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to
    attract customers to our stores. We use various media for these
    programs, including print, television, social media, database
    marketing and direct marketing. Some of our competitors may have
    substantially larger expenditures for their programs, which may
    provide them with a competitive advantage. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our
    marketing, advertising and promotional programs effectively, and
    any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our
    revenue and results of operations. Information posted about us
    and our merchandise on social media platforms and similar
    venues, including blogs, social media websites, and other forums
    for Internet-based communications that allow individuals access
    to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons,
    may be inaccurate or may harm our brand, which could have a
    material effect on our revenue and results of operations.

Compromises of
    our data security could materially harm our reputation and
    business.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store
    certain personal information from individuals, such as our
    customers and associates, and we process customer payment card
    and check information. We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or
    intrusions (such intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the
    “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of our computer
    system that process and store information related to customer
    transactions, discovered late in fiscal 2007 in which we believe
    customer data were stolen. We have taken steps designed to
    further strengthen the security of our computer system and
    protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to
    data security, consistent with a consent order with the Federal
    Trade Commission. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that
    we will not suffer a future data compromise. We rely on
    commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring
    to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of
    confidential information. Further, the systems currently used
    for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and
    the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of
    which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and
    controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. This is also
    true for check information and approval. Computer hackers may
    attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful,
    misappropriate personal information, payment card or check
    information or confidential Company business information. In
    addition, a Company associate, contractor or other third party
    with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security
    measures in order to obtain such information, and may
    purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such
    information. Advances in computer and software capabilities and
    encryption technology, new tools and other developments may
    increase the risk of such a breach. Any such compromise of our
    data security and loss of personal or business information could
    disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and
    customers’ willingness to shop in our stores, violate
    applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject
    us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material.

Our business is
    subject to seasonal influences; a decrease in sales or margins
    during the second half of the year could disproportionately
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences; we generally
    realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
    the year, which includes the

back-to-school

and year-end holiday seasons. Any decrease in sales or margins
    during this period could have a disproportionately adverse
    effect on our results of operations.

We may experience
    risks associated with our substantial size and scale.

We operate multiple retail chains in the U.S., Canada and
    Europe. Some aspects of the businesses and operations of the
    chains are conducted with relative autonomy. The large size of
    our operations, our multiple businesses and the autonomy


afforded to the chains increase the risk that systems and
    practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our
    company and that information will not be appropriately shared
    across different chains and countries.

Unseasonable
    weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our
    distribution centers are located could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’
    willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our
    stores. Severe weather could also affect our ability to
    transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and
    shipping centers. As a result, frequent, unusually heavy,
    unseasonable or untimely weather in our markets, such as snow,
    ice or rain storms, severe cold or heat or extended periods of
    unseasonable temperatures, could adversely affect our sales and
    increase markdowns. Increased governmental regulations focused
    on climate change could increase compliance costs.

Our results may
    be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic
    events.

Unforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and
    epidemics, as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes,
    tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and
    climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or
    abroad, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or
    more of our vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or
    more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the
    affected areas. Day to day operations, particularly our ability
    to receive products from our vendors or transport products to
    our stores could be adversely affected, or we could be required
    to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or
    in areas served by the affected distribution center. As a
    result, our business could be adversely affected.

We operate in
    highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to compete
    effectively.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete with many other local, regional,
    national and international retailers that sell apparel, home
    fashions and other merchandise we sell, whether in stores,
    through catalogues or media or over the internet. We compete on
    the basis of fashion, quality, price, value, merchandise
    selection and freshness, brand name recognition, service,
    reputation and store location. Other competitive factors that
    influence the demand for our merchandise include our
    advertising, marketing and promotional activities and the name
    recognition and reputation of our chains. If we fail to compete
    effectively, our sales and results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

Failure to
    attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying
    and management personnel could adversely affect our
    performance.

Our performance depends on recruiting, developing, training and
    retaining quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and
    management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level
    or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover.
    The nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us
    to the risk of immigration law violations, which risk has
    increased in recent years. In addition, any failure of
    third-parties that perform services on our behalf to comply with
    immigration, employment or other laws could damage our
    reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor. Our
    ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is
    subject to external factors such as unemployment levels,
    prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing
    demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental
    labor and employment requirements. Recently enacted health care
    reform legislation could increase our costs. In the event of
    increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages
    competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline,
    causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our
    wages could cause our earnings to decrease. In addition, certain
    associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
    therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Because of
    the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must do
    significant internal training and development for a substantial
    number of our associates. The market for retail management is
    highly competitive and, in common with other retailers, we face
    challenges in securing sufficient management talent. If we do
    not continue to attract, train and retain quality associates and
    management personnel, our performance could be adversely
    affected.

If we engage in
    mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or divest, close or
    consolidate any of our current businesses, our business will be
    subject to additional risks.

We have grown our business in part through mergers and
    acquisitions and may acquire new businesses or divest, close or
    consolidate current businesses. Acquisition or divestiture
    activities may divert attention of management from operating the
    existing businesses. We may do a

less-than-optimal

job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits,
    and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and
    time-consuming. Acquisitions may not meet our performance and
    other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or

greater-than-expected

liabilities and risks. Divestitures, closings and


consolidations also involve risks, such as the risks of exposure
    on lease and other contractual, employment and severance
    obligations, obligations undertaken in the process and potential
    liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the
    disposition or the subsequent failure of the acquirer. Failure
    to execute on mergers or divestitures, closings and
    consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect
    our future results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to
    operate information systems and implement new technologies
    effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or
    profitability.

We rely extensively on various information systems, data centers
    and software applications to manage many aspects of our
    business, including to process and record transactions in our
    stores, to enable effective communication systems, to plan and
    track inventory flow, and to generate performance and financial
    reports. We are dependent on the integrity, security and
    consistent operations of these systems and related

back-up

systems. Our computer systems are subject to damage or
    interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications
    failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic
    events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,
    hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our
    associates or contractors. The efficient operation and
    successful growth of our business depends upon these information
    systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and
    to select and implement appropriate new technologies, systems,
    controls, data centers and adequate disaster recovery systems
    successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform
    as designed or our failure to implement and operate them
    effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to
    liability and thereby harm our profitability.

We depend upon
    strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund
    our expansion, operations, interest and debt repayments, stock
    repurchases and dividends.

Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash
    flow, and to some extent upon the availability of financing
    sources, to supply capital to fund our expansions, general
    operating activities, stock repurchases, dividends, interest and
    debt repayments. Our inability to continue to generate
    sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of
    availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate
    terms when needed could adversely affect our financial
    performance including our earnings per share.

General economic
    and other factors may adversely affect consumer spending, which
    could adversely affect our sales and operating
    results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
    availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
    policy; unemployment trends; threats or possibilities of war,
    terrorism or other global or national unrest; actual or
    threatened epidemics; political or financial instability; and
    general economic, political and other factors beyond our control
    have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending.
    Consumer spending, in turn, affects sales at retailers, which
    may include TJX. Although we benefit from being an off-price
    retailer, these factors could adversely affect our sales and
    performance if we are not able to implement strategies to
    mitigate them promptly and successfully.

Issues with
    merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation, sales
    and financial results.

Various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we
    do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise
    we sell in our stores. Regulations and standards in this area,
    including those related to the Consumer Product Safety
    Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States and similar
    legislation in other countries in which we operate, change from
    time to time. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with
    regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or
    penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results. We rely on our vendors to provide quality
    merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws
    and other applicable laws, but they may not comply with their
    contractual obligations to do so. Issues with the quality and
    safety of merchandise, particularly with food, bath and body and
    children’s products, or issues with the genuineness of
    merchandise, regardless of our fault, or customer concerns about
    such issues, could cause damage to our reputation and could
    result in lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or
    losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs, and regulatory,
    civil or criminal fines or penalties, any of which could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial results.

We are subject to
    import risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign
    countries.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
    vendors and, to a lesser extent, by us, in many foreign
    countries, particularly southeastern Asia. Where we are the
    importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other
    requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of
    such products. We are subject to the various risks of


doing business in foreign markets, importing merchandise from
    abroad and purchasing product made in foreign countries, such as:

—

potential disruptions in manufacturing, logistics and supply;

—

changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and voluntary export
    restrictions on imported merchandise;

—

strikes and other events affecting delivery;

—

consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise;

—

product compliance with laws and regulations of the destination
    country;

—

product liability claims from customers or penalties from
    government agencies relating to products that are recalled,
    defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful;

—

concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor
    rights and conditions in foreign countries where merchandise is
    produced, and changing labor, environmental and other laws in
    these countries;

—

compliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business
    practices, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

—

potentially greater exposure for product warranty and safety
    problems; and

—

economic, political or other problems in countries from or
    through which merchandise is imported.

Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs,
    currency exchange rates, labor conditions, transport capacity
    and costs, systems issues, problems in third party distribution
    and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain,
    compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and
    other factors relating to international trade and imported
    merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and
    the price of our inventory. Furthermore, although we have
    implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate
    compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business
    in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, there
    can be no assurance that our associates, contractors, agents,
    vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not
    violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could
    subject us to liability and could adversely affect our
    operations or operating results.

Our expanding
    international operations increasingly expose us to risks
    inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions.

We have a significant retail presence in Canada and Europe, as
    well as buying offices around the world, and our goal as a
    global retailer is to continue to expand into other
    international markets in the future. Our foreign operations
    encounter risks similar to those faced by our
    U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign
    operations, such as understanding the retail climate and trends,
    local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets,
    complying with foreign laws, rules and regulations, and foreign
    currency fluctuations, which could have an adverse impact on our
    profitability.

Our results may
    be adversely affected by increases in the price of oil and other
    commodities.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have
    recently risen significantly. Increase in the price of oil
    increases our transportation costs for distribution, utility
    costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products
    from suppliers. Although we have implemented a hedging strategy
    to manage a portion of our transportation costs, increases in
    oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending
    and demand for our products and increase our operating costs,
    which could have an adverse effect on our performance.
    Similarly, other commodity prices have also fluctuated
    dramatically in the past. Cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics
    have recently risen significantly. Such increases are expected
    to increase the cost of merchandise, which could adversely
    affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer
    demand or reduced margins.

Failure to comply
    with existing laws, regulations and orders or changes in
    existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our
    business operations and financial performance.

We are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws,
    rules and regulations in the United States and abroad, any of
    which may change from time to time, as well as orders and
    assurances. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules,
    regulations and orders, we may be subject to fines or other
    penalties, which could materially adversely affect our
    operations and our financial results and condition. We must also
    comply with new and changing laws. Further, Generally


Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S. may
    change from time to time, and the changes could have material
    effects on our reported financial results and condition. In
    addition, there have been a large number of new legislative and
    regulatory initiatives and reforms introduced in the U.S., and
    the initiatives and reforms that have been and may be enacted
    may increase our costs.

Our results may
    be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation
    and other legal proceedings.

We are periodically involved in various legal proceedings, which
    may involve local, state and federal government inquiries and
    investigations; tax, employment, real estate, tort, consumer
    litigation and intellectual property litigation; or other
    disputes. There have been a growing number of employment-related
    lawsuits, including class actions, and we have been subject to
    these types of suits. In addition, we may be subject to
    investigations and other proceedings by regulatory agencies,
    including, but not limited to, consumer protection laws,
    advertising regulations, escheat and employment and wage and
    hour regulations. Results of legal and regulatory proceedings
    cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from reserves
    we establish estimating the probable outcome. Regardless of
    merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to
    our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of
    management attention. Legal and regulatory proceedings and
    investigations could expose us to significant defense costs,
    fines, penalties and liability to private parties and
    governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts
    and attorneys’ fees

and/or

require us to change aspects of our operations, any of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

Our real estate
    leases generally obligate us for long periods, which subjects us
    to various financial risks.

We lease virtually all of our store locations, generally for
    long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary
    distribution centers and administrative offices. Accordingly, we
    are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real
    estate, which can have a material adverse effect on our results
    as reflected in our reserve for former operations. While we have
    the right to terminate some of our leases under specified
    conditions by making specified payments, we may not be able to
    terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so.
    If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to
    continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases,
    which generally includes, among other things, paying rent and
    operating expenses for the balance of the lease term, or paying
    to exercise rights to terminate, and the performance of any of
    these obligations may be expensive. When we assign or sublease
    leases, we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the
    assignee or sublessee does not perform. In addition, when leases
    for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be
    unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable
    terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores.

Our stock price
    may fluctuate based on market expectations.

The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market
    expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we
    will achieve certain levels of net income. If the securities
    analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or
    lower their projections for future growth and financial
    performance, the market price of our stock is likely to drop. In
    addition, if our quarterly financial performance does not meet
    the expectations of securities analysts, our stock price would
    likely decline. The decrease in the stock price may be
    disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance.

Tax matters could
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes
    and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous
    factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being
    lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income
    tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher
    statutory income tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes
    in transfer pricing, changes in the valuation of deferred tax
    assets and liabilities, changes in U.S. tax legislation and
    regulation, foreign tax laws, regulations and treaties, exposure
    to additional tax liabilities, changes in accounting principles
    and interpretations relating to tax matters, which could
    adversely impact our results of operations and financial
    condition in future periods. In addition, we are subject to the
    continuous examination of our income tax returns by federal,
    state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and foreign
    countries, such authorities may challenge positions we take, and
    we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with
    respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, and
    the results of these examinations, judicial proceedings or as a
    result of the expiration of statute of limitations in specific
    jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
    adequacy of our provision for income taxes. However, it is
    possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax
    authorities and in courts,


changes in facts, expiration of statutes of limitations or other
    resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we
    have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner, which
    could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given
    financial period, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and
    our results of operations.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

TJX is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims that rise
    from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. In
    addition, TJX is a defendant in several lawsuits filed in
    federal and state courts in California, New York and Texas
    brought as putative class or collective actions on behalf of
    various groups of current and former salaried and hourly
    associates in the U.S. The lawsuits allege violations of
    the Fair Labor Standards Act and of state wage and hour
    statutes, including alleged misclassification of positions as
    exempt from overtime and alleged entitlement to additional wages
    for alleged

off-the-clock

work by hourly employees. The lawsuits seek unspecified monetary
    damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. TJX is
    vigorously defending these claims.

We provide the following additional information concerning these
    lawsuits, setting forth the name of the matter, the court in
    which the matter is pending, the related case number and the

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years
    ended January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and
    January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), and the 53-week fiscal year
    ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009). Like most retailers
    we have a 53-week fiscal year every five to six years. This
    extra week of sales volume, which also provides a lift to
    pre-tax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual
    expenses, impacts comparisons to 52-week fiscal years.

RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2011 include
    the following:

—

Same store sales for fiscal 2011 increased 4% over the prior
    year. This was achieved on top of a 6% same store sales increase
    in fiscal 2010. Our strategies of operating with lean
    inventories and buying close to need, which we managed even more
    aggressively in fiscal 2010 and continued in fiscal 2011,
    increased inventory turns and drove continued growth in customer
    traffic resulting in healthy gains in sales and profitability in
    both years.

—

Net sales increased 8% to $21.9 billion for fiscal 2011.
    Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 4%
    at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to last fiscal year end.
    Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 sales
    growth by one percentage point.

—

We made the major decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011
    to consolidate the A.J. Wright business by converting 90 stores
    to other banners and closing the remaining 72 stores, its two
    distribution centers and home office. Although this transaction
    resulted in significant charges and operating losses to the A.J.
    Wright segment for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, we believe
    consolidating the A.J. Wright chain allows us to serve the A.J.
    Wright customer demographic more efficiently, focus our
    financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger businesses
    with higher returns and enhance our growth prospects overall.

—

Our fiscal 2011 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to
    net sales) was 9.9% compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2010. The fourth
    quarter results of the A.J. Wright segment decreased our fiscal
    2011 pre-tax margin by 0.7 percentage points, which was
    more than offset by strong merchandise margin growth as well as
    expense leverage.

—

Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2011 improved
    0.7 percentage points to 73.1%. Improved merchandise
    margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs on strong
    same store sales more than offset the negative impact of
    0.2 percentage points due to the fourth quarter results of
    the A.J. Wright segment. The selling, general and administrative
    expense ratio for fiscal 2011 increased by 0.5 percentage
    points to 16.9%. The fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss
    negatively impacted the selling, general and administrative
    ratio by 0.6 percentage points, which was almost entirely
    offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense
    leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011.

—

Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or
    $3.30 per diluted share, for fiscal 2011 compared to
    $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010.
    Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share includes the negative
    impact of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss of $0.21
    per share and the benefit of $0.02 per share due to a reduction
    to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs.

—

During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 27.6 million shares of
    our common stock for $1.2 billion. Earnings per share
    reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program.

—

Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing
    operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution
    centers, were up 4% at the end of fiscal 2011 versus the prior
    year end as compared to a decrease of 10% at the end of fiscal
    2010 over the prior fiscal year end. In fiscal 2010 and 2011, we
    managed inventory levels more aggressively than in prior years,
    which had a much greater impact on the year over year inventory
    comparison in fiscal 2010 to the prior year. The fiscal 2011
    per-store inventories reflected larger available quantities of

end-of-season

branded product for future selling seasons based on greater
    market opportunities in fiscal 2011.

The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating
    results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating
    results.


Net sales:

Consolidated net sales for fiscal
    2011 totaled $21.9 billion, an 8% increase over net sales
    of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase reflected a
    4% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores
    and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates.
    Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled
    $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of
    $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6%
    increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new
    stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009.

New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both
    our consolidated store count and our selling square footage
    increased by 4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and by
    3% in fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year. We expect to end
    fiscal 2012 with 2,913 stores, which would represent a 2%
    increase in both our consolidated store base and in our selling
    square footage. The anticipated growth rate for fiscal 2012 will
    be negatively impacted by the closing of the 72 A.J. Wright
    stores that will not be converted to other banners.

The 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven
    entirely by continued growth in transactions, with the value of
    the average transaction down slightly for the year. Junior
    apparel, jewelry and home fashions performed particularly well
    in fiscal 2011. Geographically, same store sales increases in
    Canada were in line with the consolidated average while same
    store sales decreased in Europe. In the U.S., sales were strong
    throughout the country with the West Coast and Southwest above
    the consolidated average and the Northeast below the
    consolidated average.

The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by
    significant increases in customer transactions at all of our
    businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the
    average transaction. The increase in customer transactions
    accelerated during the course of fiscal 2010. Junior apparel,
    dresses, children’s apparel, footwear, accessories and home
    fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010.
    Geographically, same store sales increases in Europe and Canada
    trailed the consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong
    throughout the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West
    Coast above the average, and New England and Florida below the
    average.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
    been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
    years, or in other words, stores that are in at least their
    third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new
    store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine
    which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at
    the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
    constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
    calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
    prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned.
    Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are
    generally classified in the same way as the original store, and
    we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated
    same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our
    foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis,
    meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of
    our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the
    prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency
    exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of
    divisional operating performance.

Impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates:

Our operating results are affected by
    foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the
    value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies.
    Two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results
    are as follows:

Translation of foreign operating results into
    U.S. dollars:

In our financial statements we translate
    the operations of our segments in Canada and Europe from local
    currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect
    at different points in


time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between
    comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in
    consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth
    as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian
    and European segments. Currency translation generally does not
    affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign
    operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a
    given period.

Inventory hedges:

We routinely enter into
    inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our
    divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in
    currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not
    elected “hedge accounting” as defined by
    U.S. GAAP, we record a

mark-to-market

gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of
    operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent
    periods, the income statement impact of the

mark-to-market

adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged
    is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they
    are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and
    significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short
    period of time. The

mark-to-market

adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it
    does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we
    report.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.1% in
    fiscal 2011, 73.8% in fiscal 2010 and 75.9% in fiscal 2009. In
    fiscal 2011, the 0.2 percentage point negative impact of
    the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss was more than offset
    by improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased
    0.5 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the
    4% same store sales increase. Merchandise margin improvement was
    driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and
    buying closer to need, leading to lower markdowns compared to
    the prior year.

The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved
    consolidated merchandise margin, which increased
    2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the
    6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs,
    which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin
    improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner
    inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an
    increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared
    to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a
    benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the

rd

week

    (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for
    fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by
    higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as
    a result of operating performance that was well ahead of our
    objectives.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses:

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in fiscal 2011,
    16.4% in fiscal 2010 and 16.5% in fiscal 2009. The increase in
    selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011
    compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the 0.6 percentage point
    negative effect of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss.
    Fiscal 2011 selling, general and administrative expenses include
    impairment charges, severance and termination benefits, lease
    related obligations and other store closing costs in connection
    with the A.J. Wright consolidation, which was almost entirely
    offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs, a reduction in
    our fiscal 2011 incentive compensation versus the prior year and
    expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011.

The improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due
    to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction
    initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the
    increase in performance-based incentive compensation, which
    increased selling, general and administrative expense ratio by
    0.5 percentage points in fiscal 2010.

Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs:

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable
    losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion.

We reduced the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by
    $11.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2011,
    primarily as a result of insurance proceeds and adjustments to
    our remaining reserve. The reserve balance was
    $17.3 million at January 29, 2011. As an estimate, the
    reserve is subject to uncertainty, actual costs may vary from
    the current estimate, however such variations are not expected
    to be material to our results.


Interest expense, net:

Interest expense, net
    amounted to $39.1 million for fiscal 2011,
    $39.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $14.3 million for
    fiscal 2009. The components of interest expense, net for the
    last three fiscal years are summarized below:

Gross interest expense and gross interest income for fiscal 2011
    were flat to the prior period.

Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal
    2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the
    $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes
    issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The
    6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for
    redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we
    refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its
    scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the
    4.20% notes. In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010
    was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of
    return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances
    available for investment during fiscal 2010.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax
    rate was 38.1% in fiscal 2011, 37.8% in fiscal 2010 and 36.9% in
    fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective income tax rate for
    fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable
    to the effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and
    increasing state tax reserves, partially offset by the
    finalization of an advance pricing agreement between Canada and
    the United States (related to our intercompany transfer pricing)
    and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding
    taxes.

The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable
    impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the
    reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement
    of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009
    benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010
    by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction
    in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income.

We anticipate an effective annual income tax rate for fiscal
    2012 comparable to that for fiscal 2011.

Income from continuing operations and income per share
    from continuing operations:

Income from continuing
    operations was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, a 10% increase
    over the $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, which in turn was a
    33% increase over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009.
    Comparisons between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are negatively
    impacted by $86 million for the after tax impact of the
    A.J. Wright fourth quarter segment loss. Income from continuing
    operations per share was $3.30 in fiscal 2011, $2.84 in fiscal
    2010 and $2.08 in fiscal 2009. Several items, discussed below,
    affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2011, fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2011 earnings per share were adversely affected by the
    fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for A.J. Wright, which
    reduced earnings per share by $0.21 per share, offset in part by
    a $0.02 per share benefit for the fiscal 2011 reduction in the
    Provision for the Computer Intrusion related costs.

Fiscal 2009 earnings per share reflected an estimated $0.09 per
    share benefit from the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009, as well as a $0.04 per share benefit from the
    fiscal 2009 reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion
    related costs.

Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability
    of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted
    fiscal 2011 earnings per share by $0.02 per share compared to an
    immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. When comparing fiscal 2010 to
    fiscal 2009, foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share
    by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per share
    benefit in fiscal 2009.

In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding
    affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are
    benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased
    27.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of
    $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011; 27.0 million shares at a
    cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010; and 24.0 million
    shares at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009.


Discontinued operations and net income:

The
    fiscal 2011 net gain from discontinued operations reflects
    an after-tax benefit of $3.6 million, (which did not impact
    earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre-tax
    reduction for the estimated cost of settling lease-related
    obligations of former businesses. Fiscal 2009 net loss from
    discontinued operations reflects an after-tax loss of
    $34 million, or $0.08 per share, on the sale of Bob’s
    Stores. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net
    income was $1.3 billion, or $3.30 per share, for fiscal
    2011, $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per share, for fiscal 2010 and
    $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009.

Segment information:

The following is a
    discussion of the operating results of our business segments. As
    of January 29, 2011, we operated five business segments:
    three in the United States and one in each of Canada and Europe.
    In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are
    aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and A.J. Wright
    are each reported as a separate segment. A.J. Wright will cease
    to be a business segment during fiscal 2012 as a result of its
    consolidation. TJX’s stores operated in Canada (Winners,
    HomeSense and StyleSense) are reported as the TJX Canada
    segment, and TJX’s stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and
    HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe segment. We evaluate
    the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or
    loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general
    corporate expenses, Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion
    related costs, and interest expense. “Segment profit or
    loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
    activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
    liquidity.

Presented below is selected financial information related to our
    business segments:

Net sales at Marmaxx increased 6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to
    fiscal 2010. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 4%, which was
    on top of a strong 7% increase in the prior year.

Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2011 was driven by
    continued growth in customer transactions, partially offset by a
    slight decrease in the value of the average transaction. The
    growth in customer transactions in fiscal 2011 was on top of a
    significant increase in fiscal 2010. Same store sales for
    women’s apparel were above the chain average, with junior
    apparel particularly strong. Same store sales for men’s
    apparel were slightly below the chain average. Home categories
    improved significantly at Marmaxx, with same store sales
    increases above the chain average for fiscal 2011.
    Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country.
    Same store sales were strongest in the West Coast and Southwest,
    while the Northeast trailed the chain average for fiscal 2011.
    We also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during
    the year.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
    margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to
    13.3% in fiscal 2011 from 12.0% in fiscal 2010. This increase in
    segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase
    in merchandise margin of 0.8 percentage points driven
    primarily by lower markdowns. In addition, the 4% increase in
    same


store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net
    sales, particularly occupancy costs which improved by
    0.2 percentage points.

Segment margin increased to 12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in
    fiscal 2009. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was
    primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of
    2.4 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher
    markon. In addition, the 7% increase in same store sales
    provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales,
    particularly occupancy costs, which improved by
    0.3 percentage points. These increases were partially
    offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of
    sales, primarily due to higher accruals for performance-based
    incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well
    ahead of objectives.

We expect to open approximately 116 new stores (net of closings
    and including the conversion of 65 A.J. Wright stores) in fiscal
    2012, increasing the Marmaxx store base and selling square
    footage each by 7%.

HomeGoods’ net sales increased 9% in fiscal 2011 compared
    to fiscal 2010. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011,
    driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic, compared
    to a same store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2010. Segment
    margin of 9.5% was up from 7.7% for fiscal 2010, due to
    increased merchandise margins, driven by decreased markdowns,
    levering of expenses on the 6% same store sales and operational
    efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by
    our continuing to manage this business with much lower inventory
    levels and increasing inventory turns.

HomeGoods’ net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010,
    driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to
    a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up
    significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased
    merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased
    markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and
    operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements
    were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory
    levels, which drove better off-price buying and increased
    inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by
    higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as
    a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives.

In fiscal 2012, we plan to add a net of 38 HomeGoods stores
    (including the conversion of 16 A.J. Wright stores) and increase
    selling square footage by 11%.

A.J.
    Wright

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, TJX announced that it
    would consolidate its A.J. Wright division by converting 90 of
    the A.J. Wright stores into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods
    stores and by closing the remaining 72 stores, its two
    distribution centers and home office. TJX commenced the
    liquidation process in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and 20
    stores had been closed as of January 29, 2011. All of the
    remaining stores ceased operation by February 13, 2011. See
    Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more
    information.

A majority of the costs related to the closing of the A.J.
    Wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter. The
    operating results of the A.J. Wright segment for the full year
    of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of
    $140.6 million, which includes the following:

In the first half of fiscal 2012, TJX will incur additional
    store closing costs and operating losses due to the completion
    of the A.J. Wright store closings as well as the costs to
    convert the A.J. Wright stores to other TJX banners and grand
    re-opening costs for those stores. TJX estimates that during
    fiscal 2012, it will incur additional A.J. Wright segment losses
    of approximately $66 million, primarily relating to the
    completion of store operations and lease related obligations,
    and conversion costs and grand re-opening costs of approximately
    $28 million, which will be reflected in the segments of the
    new banners into which the stores are converted. The majority of
    these charges are expected to be incurred in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2012.

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%.
    Segment profit increased to $12.6 million in fiscal 2010,
    compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2009.
    The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due
    to improved merchandise margin. Like our other divisions, cost
    reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the
    same store sales increase was partially offset by higher
    accruals for performance-based incentive compensation.

Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense)
    increased 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.
    Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by
    approximately 9 percentage points, as compared to the same
    period last year. Same store sales were up 4% in fiscal 2011
    compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2010. Same store sales
    of men’s apparel, dresses and home fashions were above the
    segment average for fiscal 2011.

Segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to $352 million
    compared to $255 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of
    foreign currency translation increased segment profit by
    $25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The

mark-to-market

adjustment on inventory-related hedges reduced segment profit in
    fiscal 2011 by $7 million compared to an immaterial impact
    in fiscal 2010. The unfavorable change in the

mark-to-market

adjustment of our inventory hedges reduced fiscal 2011 segment
    margin by 0.3 percentage points. TJX Canada segment margin
    increased 2.2 percentage


points to 14.0% in fiscal 2011, compared to 11.8% in fiscal
    2010. The segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven
    by a strong improvement in merchandise margins.

Net sales increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by
    approximately $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal
    2009. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an
    increase of 3% in fiscal 2009. Same store sales of junior
    apparel, dresses, men’s apparel and footwear, as well as
    HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above the segment average
    for fiscal 2010.

Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million
    compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of
    foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by
    $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The

mark-to-market

adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material
    impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in
    fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was
    primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins.
    Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a
    percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating
    efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for
    performance-based incentive compensation as a result of
    operating performance well ahead of objectives.

As of the end of fiscal 2011, we operated three StyleSense
    stores which are included in the Winners totals in the above
    table. We are bringing the Marshalls chain to Canada, with six
    stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2012. We believe that Canada
    can ultimately support 90 to 100 Marshalls stores. We expect to
    add a net of 15 stores in Canada in fiscal 2012 (including the
    Marshalls stores) and plan to increase selling square footage by
    5%.

Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2011 to
    $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2010.
    Currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011
    results, reducing net sales by $86 million. Same store
    sales were down 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5% increase in
    fiscal 2010.

Segment profit decreased to $75.8 million for fiscal 2011,
    and segment profit margin decreased to 3.0%. We believe that
    execution issues at TJX Europe were the primary reasons for
    below-plan sales and segment profit. We believe that our
    expansion in Europe took management’s focus off of the
    proper execution of the fundamentals of our off-price strategy
    and that as a result, consumers did not find the values they had
    come to expect at our stores. This led to same store sales
    declines, reduced merchandise margins, as a result of increased
    markdowns, and the de-levering of expenses. We intend to slow
    store growth for TJX Europe in fiscal 2012 and focus on
    correcting the execution issues. Despite this setback, we remain
    confident that Europe holds significant growth potential for TJX.

Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2010 to
    $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009.
    Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by
    approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal
    2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to
    a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010
    increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin
    increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in
    segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise
    margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales
    increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and
    Poland along with higher accruals for performance- based
    incentive compensation in fiscal 2010. We also invested in
    strengthening our shared services infrastructure.


Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment
    profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a
    favorable

mark-to-market

adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the
    conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling.

As stated above, we intend to slow our growth in fiscal 2012. We
    plan to open a net of 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and to
    expand total TJX Europe selling square footage by 8%. This
    compares to a net increase of 54 stores and an 18% increase in
    selling square footage in fiscal 2011.

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes
    represents those costs not specifically related to the
    operations of our business segments and is included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses, except for the

mark-to-market

adjustment on diesel fuel hedges, which is included in cost of
    sales. Fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat
    to the prior year. The slight increase in fiscal 2011 was due to
    increased investment in corporate systems, management training
    programs and normal expense growth offsetting the effect of
    higher charitable donations and incentive compensation incurred
    in fiscal 2010. The increase in general corporate expense in
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an
    $18 million contribution to the TJX Foundation in fiscal
    2010 and higher performance-based incentive and benefit plan
    accruals, partially offset by benefits related to hedging
    activity.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating
    Activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $1,976 million in fiscal 2011, $2,272 million in
    fiscal 2010 and $1,155 million in fiscal 2009. The cash
    generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
    years was largely due to operating earnings.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased $295 million
    compared to fiscal 2010. Net income plus the non-cash impact of
    depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of
    $1,897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,659 in fiscal
    2010, an increase of $238 million. The change in
    merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts
    payable, resulted in a use of cash of $48 million in fiscal
    2011, compared to a source of cash of $345 million in
    fiscal 2010. Although we continued to operate with leaner
    inventories throughout fiscal 2011, our strategy of being more
    aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact
    on cash flows in fiscal 2010. In addition, the increase in
    inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth, as well
    as a year-end increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage
    of market opportunities. Changes in current income taxes
    payable/recoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows,
    as compared to fiscal 2010, by $203 million due to the
    timing of tax payments. The change in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities provided cash of $78 million in fiscal 2011
    compared to cash provided of $31 million in fiscal 2010.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased
    $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided
    cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of
    $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal
    2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related
    change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of
    $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a
    $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in
    inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing
    implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner
    inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased
    inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes
    payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by
    $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of
    $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010
    cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of
    February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and
    other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal
    2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance-based
    incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of
    the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes
    to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the
    deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by
    $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable
    impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily
    reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings
    plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009.

Reserve for obligations of former
    operations:

We have a reserve for the remaining
    future obligations of businesses we have closed, sold or
    otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bob’s Stores
    and A.J. Wright. The


majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases
    associated with these businesses. The reserve balance was
    $54.7 million at January 29, 2011 and
    $35.9 million at January 30, 2010. See Note C to
    the consolidated financial statements for more information.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 13 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and up to seven
    leases of Bob’s Stores, in addition to those included in
    the reserve. The reserve for former operations does not reflect
    these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of
    future liability to us is probable.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have
    contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or
    guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX
    being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have
    assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed
    to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of
    leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved, we
    have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and
    accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a
    material impact on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient
    information about these leases to estimate our potential
    contingent obligations under them that could be triggered in the
    event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill
    their obligations related to one or more of these leases.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations of (i) leases of
    former operations not included in our reserve for former
    operations and (ii) properties of our discontinued
    operations that we would expect to sublet, if the subtenants did
    not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $75 million
    as of January 29, 2011. We believe that most or all of
    these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the
    extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing
    Activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
    expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate

    expect to fund through internally generated funds. Fiscal 2012
    capital expenditures are expected to include $239 million
    for new stores, $55 million of which is associated with
    converting the 90 A.J. Wright stores to other banners.
    Additionally, $269 million is for our offices and
    distribution centers to support growth and $317 million is
    for store renovations.

We also purchased short-term investments that had initial
    maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are
    not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In
    fiscal 2011, we purchased $120 million of such short-term
    investments, compared to $279 million in fiscal 2010.
    Additionally, $180 million of such short-term investments
    were sold or matured during fiscal 2011 compared to
    $153 million last year. No such short-term investments were
    held during fiscal 2009. Investing activities for fiscal 2009
    also include cash flows associated with net investment hedges.
    During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net
    investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges
    during the fourth quarter of that year. The net cash received on
    net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to
    $14.4 million.


Financing
    Activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
    outflows of $1,224 million in fiscal 2011,
    $584 million in fiscal 2010 and $769 million in fiscal
    2009.

We spent $1,200 million to repurchase and retire
    27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2011,
    $950 million to repurchase and retire 27.0 million
    shares in fiscal 2010 and $741 million to repurchase and
    retire 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 under our stock
    repurchase programs. We record the purchase of our stock on a
    cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial
    statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the
    settlement of our repurchases. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2011, we completed the $1 billion stock repurchase
    program approved in September 2009 and initiated another
    $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in February
    2010. As of January 29, 2011, $594 million remained
    available for purchase under that program, and in February 2011,
    our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion
    stock repurchase program. We currently plan to repurchase
    approximately $1.2 billion of stock under our stock
    repurchase programs in fiscal 2012. We determine the timing and
    amount of repurchases made directly and under

Rule 10b5-1

plans from time to time based on our assessment of various
    factors including anticipated excess cash flow, liquidity,
    market conditions, the economic environment and prospects for
    the business and other factors. The timing and amount of these
    purchases may change from our plans.

Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the
    net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On
    April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes. Related to this
    transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were
    converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used
    the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional
    shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On
    July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. We used a portion of
    the proceeds of this offering to refinance our
    C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009,
    prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder,
    together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes
    on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
    totaled $0.60 per share in fiscal 2011, $0.48 per share in
    fiscal 2010 and $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009. Cash payments
    for dividends on our common stock totaled $229 million in
    fiscal 2011, $198 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $177 million in fiscal 2009. We announced our intention to
    increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.19 per
    share, effective with the dividend payable in June 2011, subject
    to the approval of our Board of Directors. Financing activities
    also included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
    options of $176 million in fiscal 2011, $170 million
    in fiscal 2010 and $142 million in fiscal 2009.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
    requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
    bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
    As of January 29, 2011, we had a $500 million
    revolving credit facility maturing in May 2013 and a
    $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May
    2011. The three-year agreement maturing in May 2013 was entered
    into in May 2010 to replace a similar agreement that matured at
    that time. The three-year agreement requires the payment of
    17.5 basis points annually on the unused committed amount.
    The agreement maturing in May 2011 requires the payment of six
    basis points annually on the committed amount (whether used or
    unused). Both of these agreements have no compensating balance
    requirements; contain various covenants, including a requirement
    of a specified ratio of debt to earnings and serve as back up to
    TJX’s commercial paper program. The availability under our
    revolving credit facilities was $1 billion at
    January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and we had no
    borrowings outstanding at those dates under these agreements. We
    believe existing cash balances, internally-generated funds and
    our revolving credit facilities will meet our future operating
    needs. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings
    outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010. There were
    no U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal
    2011.

As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010,
    TJX’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit
    facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million
    facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter
    of credit facility. As of January 29, 2011 and
    January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the
    Canadian credit line for operating expenses. As of
    January 29, 2011, TJX Europe had a credit line of
    £20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on
    this European credit line as of January 29, 2011 or
    January 30, 2010.

We believe that internally-generated funds and our current
    credit facilities will adequately meet our operating, debt and
    capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See
    Note K to the consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding our long-term debt and other financing
    sources.


Contractual obligations:

As of
    January 29, 2011, we had payment obligations (including
    current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases
    for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will

The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest
    costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum
    rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes,
    other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a
    percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third
    of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
    January 29, 2011.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders
    for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures,
    supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts
    for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
    executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from
    purchase obligations long-term agreements for services and
    operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which include
    $209.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, the
    majority of which will come due beyond five years,
    $165.3 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements
    of which are included in the lease commitments in the above
    table, and $179.8 million for uncertain tax positions for
    which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they
    may be paid.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain
    estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These
    judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and
    other factors which we continually review and believe are
    reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies,
    involving management estimates and judgments, to be those
    relating to the areas described below.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method
    for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost.
    Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross
    margins are determined by calculating a

cost-to-retail

ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This
    method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the
    retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation
    than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management
    estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage.
    Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in
    inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced.
    Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method
    is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a
    normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when
    and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing
    management’s discretion and the need for management
    estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires
    estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a
    full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine
    shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of
    shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is
    typically not a significant factor in full year results.
    Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our
    disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical
    inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory
    valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have
    arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and
    allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the
    value of inventory. We have generally not entered into such
    arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

We evaluate
    the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived
    assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances
    occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those


assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in
    projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as our
    business units, which involve a number of factors including
    historical trends, recent performance and general economic
    assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived
    assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the
    excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated
    fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 29, 2011
    that the carrying value of our long-lived assets was appropriate.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are
    accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in
    the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far
    in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are
    required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the
    discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term
    rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of
    which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The
    discount rate, which we determine annually based on market
    interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return,
    which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two
    factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost
    of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified
    pension plan. When the market performance of our plan assets,
    discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the
    funded status of our plan, we may make contributions to the plan
    in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2011 we
    funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution
    of $100 million.

Share-based compensation:

In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards
    issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive
    plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as
    “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods
    during which the recipients are required to provide service. We
    use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the
    fair value of stock options granted, which requires management
    to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of
    different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact
    on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the
    related compensation cost.

Casualty insurance:

In fiscal 2008, we
    initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance.
    Previously, our casualty insurance program required us to
    estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our
    annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with
    the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and
    other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and
    assumptions, and actual results could differ from these
    estimates. A large portion of these claims is funded with a
    non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our
    estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of
    $14.2 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty
    insurance program as of January 29, 2011.

Income taxes:

Like many large corporations,
    our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state
    and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign
    countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge
    positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings
    with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims,
    deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
    evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of
    the facts, circumstances and information available at the
    reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that
    it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that
    the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However,
    it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the
    final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative
    proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of
    limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of,
    or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or
    negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in
    accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination
    or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such
    final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material
    adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in
    which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period
    in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably
    estimable.

Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for
    former operations:

As discussed in Notes B and C to
    the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for
    probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for
    future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate
    leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs
    and expenses we will incur in connection with the Computer
    Intrusion and in connection with the future obligations of our
    former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other
    former businesses are long-term obligations, and the estimated
    cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including
    when and on what terms we will assign the lease, or sublease the
    leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated
    with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees
    or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations
    under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be
    settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification,
    may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these
    assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various
    potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each
    situation and location. We


believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most
    likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the
    Computer Intrusion and the future obligations of our former
    operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we
    will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current
    estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our
    reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the
    underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not
    expect any such differences to be material to our results of
    operations.

Loss contingencies:

Certain conditions may
    exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that
    may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or
    more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with
    the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent
    liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of
    judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
    proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may
    result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in
    evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
    claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or
    expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
    that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the
    estimated liability in the financial statements. If the
    assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
    contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is
    probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose
    the nature of the contingent liability, together with an
    estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that
    such loss is not reasonably estimable.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
    PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note A to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this annual report for recently issued accounting
    standards, including the expected dates of adoption and
    estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
    investment in our Canadian and European operations on the
    translation of these foreign operations into the
    U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that
    are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold.
    As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated
    financial statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany
    transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise
    purchase commitments incurred by these operations with
    derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative
    contracts only for the purpose of hedging an underlying economic
    exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts,
    designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying
    exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
    creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
    industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
    exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
    underlying exposures described above as well as the translation
    of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of
    January 29, 2011, the analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position but could have reduced our
    pre-tax income for fiscal 2011 by approximately $43 million.

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

Our cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain lines
    of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest
    rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition,
    changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes
    in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We
    periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost
    of borrowing; however, we believe that fixed interest rates on
    most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market
    conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a
    hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to
    our maximum variable rate debt outstanding, and to our cash and
    cash equivalents and short-term investments as of
    January 29, 2011. The analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.


EQUITY PRICE
    RISK

The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of
    which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and
    uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension
    assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our
    exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are
    exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and
    overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the
    financial markets can adversely affect the value of our pension
    plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting
    in increased contributions to the plan.

    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

    through F-32 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by
    this report pursuant to

Rules 13a-15

and

15d-15

of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
    that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and
    (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of implementing controls and
    procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011
    identified in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s
    and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
    effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
    personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:

—

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of TJX;

—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and
    expenditures of TJX are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of management and directors of TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    TJX’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.


Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems designed to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 29, 2011 based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of January 29, 2011.

(d) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited and reported on our consolidated
    financial statements contained herein, has audited the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 29, 2011, and has issued an attestation
    report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders

of The TJX
    Companies, Inc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 29,
    2011 and January 30, 2010, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended January 29, 2011 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The TJX
    Companies, Inc.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A.

Summary of
    Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial
    statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
    “TJX” or “we”) include the financial
    statements of all of TJX’s subsidiaries, all of which are
    wholly owned. All of its activities are conducted by TJX or its
    subsidiaries and are consolidated in these financial statements.
    All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

During fiscal 2010, TJX amended its
    bylaws to change its fiscal year end to the Saturday nearest to
    the last day of January of each year. Previously TJX’s
    fiscal year ended on the last Saturday of January. The fiscal
    years ended January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and
    January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010) included 52 weeks,
    while the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal
    2009) included 53 weeks. This change shifted the
    timing of TJX’s next 53 week fiscal year to the fiscal
    year ending February 2, 2013.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts
    refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the TJX
    financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America
    (U.S. GAAP), requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the
    date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TJX
    considers its accounting policies relating to inventory
    valuation, impairments of long-lived assets, retirement
    obligations, share-based compensation, casualty insurance,
    income taxes, reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs,
    disposal activity and discontinued operations, and loss
    contingencies to be the most significant accounting policies
    that involve management estimates and judgments. Actual amounts
    could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be
    material.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the
    time of sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of
    a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
    our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
    sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
    customer receives the layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the
    sale of store cards as well as the value of store cards issued
    to customers as a result of a return or exchange are deferred
    until the customers use the cards to acquire merchandise. Based
    on historical experience, we estimate the amount of store cards
    that will not be redeemed (“store card breakage”) and,
    to the extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized
    into income over the redemption period. Revenue recognized from
    store card breakage was $10.1 million in fiscal 2011,
    $7.8 million in fiscal 2010 and $10.7 million in
    fiscal 2009.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, includes
    the cost of merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory
    and fuel-related derivative contracts; store occupancy costs
    (including real estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs and
    fixed asset depreciation); the costs of operating our
    distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs
    directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs
    related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
    payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
    expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
    payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
    costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
    related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers
    highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments
    with maturities greater than three months but less than one year
    at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments.
    Our investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper,
    institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
    banks. At January 29, 2011, the Company had
    $14.6 million of restricted cash, all of which is reported
    in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The
    restricted cash serves as collateral that provides financial
    assurance that the Company will fulfill its obligations with
    respect to certain leases in Europe. The cash is held in an
    escrow account and is restricted as to withdrawal or use for a
    term as long as the underlying lease.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for
    valuing inventories which results in a weighted average cost. We
    utilize a permanent markdown strategy and lower the cost value
    of the inventory that is subject to markdown at the time the
    retail prices are lowered in our stores. We accrue for
    inventory

F-7

obligations at the time inventory is shipped. At
    January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, in-transit
    inventory included in merchandise inventories was
    $445.7 million and $396.8 million, respectively.
    Comparable amounts were reflected in accounts payable at those
    dates.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions
    consist primarily of the repurchase by TJX of its common stock
    under its stock repurchase programs and the recognition of
    compensation expense and issuance of common stock under
    TJX’s stock incentive plan. In fiscal 2010, we also issued
    shares upon conversion of convertible notes that were called for
    redemption, discussed in Note K. Under our stock repurchase
    programs we repurchase our common stock on the open market. The
    par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock
    with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged
    against any available additional paid-in capital
    (“APIC”) and the balance charged to retained earnings.
    Due to the high volume of repurchases over the past several
    years, we have no remaining balance in APIC in any of the years
    presented. All shares repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under TJX’s stock incentive plan are issued
    from authorized but unissued shares, and proceeds received are
    recorded by increasing common stock for the par value of the
    shares with the excess over par added to APIC. Income tax
    benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of
    a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the
    exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets to the
    extent that an asset for the related grant has been created. Any
    tax benefits greater than the deferred tax assets created at the
    time of expensing the options are credited to APIC; any
    deficiencies in the tax benefits are debited to APIC to the
    extent a pool for such deficiencies exists. In the absence of a
    pool any deficiencies are realized in the related periods’
    statements of income through the provision for income taxes. Any
    excess income tax benefits are included in cash flows from
    financing activities in the statements of cash flows. The par
    value of restricted stock awards is also added to common stock
    when the stock is issued, generally at grant date. The fair
    value of the restricted stock awards in excess of par value is
    added to APIC as the awards are amortized into earnings over the
    related vesting periods. Upon the call of our convertible notes
    most holders of the notes converted them into TJX common stock.
    When converted the face value of the convertible notes less
    unamortized debt discount was relieved, common stock was
    credited with the par value of the shares issued, and the excess
    of the carrying value of the convertible notes over par was
    added to APIC.

Share-Based Compensation:

TJX accounts for
    share-based compensation in accordance with U.S. GAAP
    whereby it estimates the fair value of each option grant on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. See
    Note I for a detailed discussion of share-based
    compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest expense is presented
    as a net amount. The following is a summary of net interest
    expense:

We capitalize interest during the active construction period of
    major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the
    cost of the related assets.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial
    reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and
    amortization of property using the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated
    over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are
    generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
    lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
    Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
    10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
    property was $461.5 million for fiscal 2011,
    $435.8 million for fiscal 2010 and $398.0 million for
    fiscal 2009. Amortization expense for property held under a
    capital lease was $2.2 million in each of fiscal 2011, 2010
    and 2009. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed
    software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 10 years.
    Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the
    related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or
    loss is included in income. Pre-opening costs, including rent,
    are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

TJX begins to record rent
    expense when it takes possession of a store, which is typically
    30 to

F-8

60 days prior to the opening of the store and generally
    occurs before the commencement of the lease term, as specified
    in the lease.

Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily the
    excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
    minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
    83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
    T.J. Maxx chain. In addition, goodwill includes the excess of
    cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of
    Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill totaled $72.2 million as of January 29, 2011,
    $72.1 million as of January 30, 2010 and
    $71.8 million as of January 31, 2009. Goodwill is
    considered to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not
    amortized. Changes in goodwill are attributable to the effect of
    exchange rate changes on Winners’ reported goodwill.

Tradename is the value assigned to the name
    “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 as part of
    the acquisition of the Marshalls chain. The value of the
    tradename was determined by the discounted present value of
    assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a reduction for
    their pro-rata share of negative goodwill acquired. The
    Marshalls tradename is carried at a value of $107.7 million
    and is considered to have an indefinite life.

TJX occasionally acquires or licenses other trademarks to be
    used in connection with private label merchandise. Such
    trademarks are included in other assets and are amortized to
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, over their
    useful life, generally from 7 to 10 years.

Goodwill, tradename and trademarks, and the related accumulated
    amortization if any, are included in the respective operating
    segment to which they relate.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and
    Tradename:

TJX evaluates its long-lived assets and
    assets with indefinite lives (other than goodwill and tradename)
    for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable, and at least annually in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash
    flow of an asset or asset group is less than the carrying cost
    of that asset or asset group. The evaluation for long-lived
    assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash
    flows, which is generally at the individual store level. If
    indicators of impairment are identified, an undiscounted cash
    flow analysis is performed to determine if an impairment exists.
    The

store-by-store

evaluations did not indicate any recoverability issues (for any
    of our continuing operations) during the past three fiscal
    years. Our decision to close the A.J. Wright chain (see
    Note C) resulted in the impairment of A.J.
    Wright’s fixed assets and impairment charges of
    $83 million are reflected in the A.J. Wright segment.

Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred and
    at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, by
    comparing the carrying value of the related reporting unit to
    its fair value. An impairment exists when this analysis, using
    typical valuation models such as the discounted cash flow
    method, shows that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
    than the carrying cost of the reporting unit.

Tradename is also tested for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the tradename may exceed its fair value and at least annually in
    the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Testing is performed by
    comparing the discounted present value of assumed after-tax
    royalty payments to the carrying value of the tradename.

There was no impairment related to our goodwill, tradename or
    trademarks in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs
    as incurred. Advertising expense was $249.8 million for
    fiscal 2011, $227.5 million for fiscal 2010 and
    $254.0 million for fiscal 2009.

Foreign Currency Translation:

TJX’s foreign
    assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at
    fiscal year end exchange rates with resulting translation gains
    and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component
    of accumulated

F-9

other comprehensive income (loss). Activity of the foreign
    operations that affect the statements of income and cash flows
    is translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the
    fiscal year.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for loss
    contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be
    incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. TJX
    evaluates pending litigation and other contingencies at least
    quarterly and adjusts the reserve for such contingencies for
    changes in probable and reasonably estimable losses. TJX
    includes an estimate for related legal costs at the time such
    costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

New Accounting Standards:

We do not expect the
    adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a
    significant impact on our results of operations, financial
    position or cash flow.

Note B.

Provision
    (credit) for Computer Intrusion related costs

TJX has a reserve for its estimate of the remaining probable
    losses arising from an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (the
    intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the “Computer
    Intrusion”) into portions of its computer system, which was
    discovered late in fiscal 2007 and in which TJX believes
    customer data were stolen. TJX reduced the Provision for
    Computer Intrusion related costs by $11.6 million in fiscal
    2011 and by $30.5 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of
    negotiations, settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in
    our estimated losses. The reserve balance was $17.3 million
    at January 29, 2011 and $23.5 million at
    January 30, 2010. As an estimate, the reserve is subject to
    uncertainty, actual costs may vary from the current estimate
    however such variations are not expected to be material.

Note C.

Dispositions and
    Reserves Related to Former Operations

TJX has disposal activities relating to two businesses during
    the last three fiscal years.

Consolidation of A.J. Wright:

On December 8,
    2010, the Board of Directors approved the consolidation of the
    A.J. Wright division whereby TJX would convert 90 A.J. Wright
    stores into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods stores and close
    the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home
    office. TJX has increasingly improved its ability to reach the
    A.J. Wright customer demographic through T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    stores and has seen these stores perform well in markets with
    these demographics. Even though the A.J. Wright chain was
    profitable, consolidating the A.J. Wright chain is expected to
    allow TJX to serve this customer demographic more efficiently,
    focus TJX’s financial and managerial resources on fewer,
    larger businesses with higher returns and enhance the growth
    prospects for TJX overall. All A.J. Wright stores ceased
    operating by February 13, 2011 with the conversion to other
    banners expected to be completed by the end of the first half of
    fiscal 2012. Our fourth quarter segment results for A.J. Wright
    include impairment charges, severance and termination benefits,
    estimated lease obligations and other store closing costs as
    well as operating losses to liquidate store inventory.

The A.J. Wright consolidation is not classified as a
    discontinued operation due to our expectation that a significant
    portion of the sales of the A.J. Wright stores will migrate to
    other TJX stores. Thus the costs incurred in fiscal 2011
    relating to the A.J. Wright consolidation are reflected in
    continuing operations as part of the A.J. Wright segment which
    reported a segment loss of $130 million for fiscal 2011.
    The fiscal 2011 segment loss includes the following:

Fixed asset impairment charges—Non cash

$

82,589

Severance and termination benefits

25,400

Lease obligations and other closing costs

11,700

Operating losses

10,297

Total segment loss

$

129,986

The impairment charges relate to furniture and fixtures and
    leasehold improvements that will be disposed of and are deemed
    to have no value, as well as A.J. Wright’s two owned
    distribution centers. The distribution centers were closed prior
    to the end of the fiscal year, are being held for sale and were
    adjusted to fair market value. The impairment charges, severance
    and termination benefits, lease obligations and other closing
    costs are included in selling, general and administrative
    expenses on the consolidated income statement.

In the first half of fiscal 2012, TJX will incur additional
    store closing costs and operating losses due to the completion
    of the A.J. Wright store closings as well as the costs to
    convert the A.J. Wright stores to other TJX banners and grand
    re-opening costs for those stores. TJX estimates that during
    fiscal 2012 it will incur additional A.J. Wright segment losses
    of approximately $65 million, primarily relating to the
    completion of store operations and lease related obligations and
    conversion costs and

F-10

grand

re-opening

costs of approximately $28 million, which will be reflected
    in the segments of the new banners into which the stores are
    converted. The majority of these charges will occur in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2012.

Sale of Bob’s Stores:

In fiscal 2009, TJX
    sold Bob’s Stores and recorded as a component of
    discontinued operations a loss on disposal (including expenses
    relating to the sale) of $19 million, net of tax benefits
    of $13 million. The net carrying value of Bob’s Stores
    assets sold was $33 million, which consisted primarily of
    merchandise inventory of $56 million, offset by merchandise
    payable of $21 million. The loss on disposal reflects sales
    proceeds of $7.2 million as well as expenses of
    $5.8 million relating to the sale. TJX also remains
    contingently liable on seven of the Bob’s Stores leases.

TJX reclassified the operating results of Bob’s Stores for
    all periods prior to the sale as a component of discontinued
    operations. The following table presents the net sales, segment
    profit (loss) and after-tax loss from operations reclassified to

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we reduced our reserve by
    $6 million to reflect a lower estimated cost for lease
    obligations for former operations classified as discontinued
    operations, which was recorded to discontinued operations on the
    income statement. We also added to the reserve the consolidation
    costs of the A.J. Wright chain detailed above. The reserve
    balance as of January 29, 2011 includes approximately
    $20 million for severance and termination benefits relating
    to the A.J. Wright consolidation. The lease related obligations
    reflects our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated
    subtenant income, and the cost of probable claims against us for
    liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of
    former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of
    these lease obligations. The actual net cost of the various
    lease obligations included in the reserve may differ from our
    estimate. We estimate that the majority of the former operations
    reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual
    timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining
    lease obligations are actually settled.

F-11

TJX may also be contingently liable on up to 13 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and up to seven
    leases of Bob’s Stores, also a former TJX business, in
    addition to those included in the reserve. The reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because
    TJX does not believe that the likelihood of future liability to
    TJX is probable.

Capital Stock and
    Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

TJX repurchased and retired
    27.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of
    $1,200.7 million during fiscal 2011. TJX reflects stock
    repurchases in its financial statements on a
    “settlement” basis. We had cash expenditures under our
    repurchase programs of $1,193.4 million in fiscal 2011,
    $944.8 million in fiscal 2010 and $751.1 million in
    fiscal 2009. We repurchased 27.4 million shares in fiscal
    2011, 26.9 million shares in fiscal 2010 and
    24.3 million shares in fiscal 2009. These expenditures were
    funded primarily by cash generated from operations together, in
    fiscal 2009, with the proceeds of a debt issuance. In October
    2010, TJX completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program
    authorized in September 2009 under which TJX repurchased
    24.1 million shares of common stock. In February 2010,
    TJX’s Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase
    program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional
    $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. Under
    this plan, on a “trade date” basis, TJX repurchased
    9.0 million shares of common stock at a cost of
    $405.7 million during fiscal 2011 and $594.3 million
    remained available at January 29, 2011. All shares
    repurchased under the stock repurchase programs have been
    retired.

In February 2011, TJX’s Board of Directors approved a new
    stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to
    an additional $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to
    time.

TJX has five million shares of authorized but unissued preferred
    stock, $1 par value.

In April 2009, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes. There were 462,057 notes with a
    carrying value of $365.1 million that were converted into
    15.1 million shares of TJX common stock at a conversion
    rate of 32.667 shares per note. TJX paid $2.3 million
    to redeem the remaining 2,886 notes outstanding that were not
    converted.

The weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per
    share calculation excludes the impact of outstanding stock
    options if the assumed proceeds per share of the option is in
    excess of the related fiscal period’s average price of
    TJX’s common stock. Such options are excluded because they
    would have an antidilutive effect. No such options were excluded
    at the end of fiscal 2011. There were 9.5 million options
    excluded at the end of fiscal 2010 and 5.2 million options
    were excluded at the end of fiscal 2009.

Note F.

Financial
    Instruments

As a result of its operating and financing activities TJX is
    exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign
    currency exchange rates and fuel costs. These market risks may
    adversely affect TJX’s operating results and financial
    position. When deemed appropriate, TJX seeks to minimize risk
    from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
    fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments.
    Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or
    other speculative purposes. TJX does not use leveraged
    derivative financial instruments. TJX recognizes all derivative
    instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statements of
    financial position and measures those instruments at fair value.
    The fair values of the derivatives are classified as assets or
    liabilities, current or non-current, based upon valuation
    results and settlement dates of the individual contracts.
    Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the
    period of the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge
    accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
    either recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    other comprehensive income or are recognized currently in
    earnings, along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis
    of the item being hedged. Effective in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009, TJX no longer entered into contracts to hedge its
    net investments in foreign subsidiaries and settled all existing
    contracts. As a result, there were no net investment contracts
    as of January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010.

Interest Rate Contracts:

During fiscal 2004,
    TJX entered into interest rate swaps with respect to
    $100 million of the $200 million ten-year notes
    outstanding at that time. Under those interest rate swaps, which
    settled in December 2009, TJX paid a specific variable interest
    rate indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate and received a fixed
    rate applicable to the underlying debt, effectively converting
    the interest on a portion of the notes from fixed to a floating
    rate of interest. The interest income/

F-13

expense on those swaps was accrued as earned and recorded as an
    adjustment to the interest expense accrued on the fixed-rate
    debt. The interest rate swaps were designated as fair value
    hedges on the underlying debt. The valuation of the swaps
    resulted in an offsetting fair value adjustment to the debt
    hedged. Accordingly, current installments of long-term debt were
    increased by $1.6 million in fiscal 2009. The average
    effective interest rate on $100 million of the 7.45%
    unsecured notes, inclusive of the effect of hedging activity,
    was approximately 4.04% in fiscal 2010 and 6.54% in fiscal 2009.

Diesel Fuel Contracts:

During fiscal 2011,
    TJX entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its notional
    diesel requirements for fiscal 2012, based on the diesel fuel
    consumed by independent freight carriers transporting the
    Company’s inventory. These economic hedges at
    January 29, 2011 relate to 10% of TJX’s notional
    diesel requirement in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. These
    diesel fuel hedge agreements will settle during the first half
    of fiscal 2012. The fuel hedge agreements outstanding at
    January 30, 2010 hedged approximately 10% of our notional
    diesel fuel requirements in the second quarter of fiscal 2011
    and 20% of our notional diesel requirement in the third and
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which settled throughout the year
    and terminated in February 2011.

Independent freight carriers transporting the Company’s
    inventory charge TJX a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price
    increases as incurred by the carrier. The hedge agreements are
    designed to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel pricing (and
    the resulting per mile surcharges payable by TJX) by setting a
    fixed price per gallon for the period being hedged. TJX elected
    not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts. The
    change in the fair value of the hedge agreements resulted in a
    gain of $1.2 million in fiscal 2011, a gain of
    $4.5 million in fiscal 2010 and a loss of $4.9 million
    in fiscal 2009, all of which are reflected in earnings as a
    component of cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on portions of merchandise purchases made and anticipated
    to be made in currencies other than the functional currency of
    TJX Europe (operating in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany
    and Poland), TJX Canada (Canada) and Marmaxx (U.S.). These
    contracts are typically twelve months or less in duration. The
    contracts outstanding at January 29, 2011 cover certain
    commitments and anticipated needs throughout fiscal 2012. TJX
    elected not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts.
    The change in the fair value of these contracts resulted in a
    loss of $6.8 million in fiscal 2011, income of
    $0.5 million in fiscal 2010 and a loss of $2.3 million
    in fiscal 2009 and is included in earnings as a component of
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.

Until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, TJX entered into
    foreign currency forward and swap contracts in both Canadian
    dollars and British pounds sterling and accounted for them as
    hedges of the net investment in and between foreign subsidiaries
    or cash flow hedges of Winners’ long-term intercompany
    debt. TJX applied hedge accounting to these hedge contracts of
    our investment in foreign subsidiaries, and changes in fair
    value of these contracts, as well as gains and losses upon
    settlement, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, offsetting changes in the cumulative foreign translation
    adjustments of the foreign subsidiaries. The change in fair
    value of the contracts designated as hedges of the investment in
    foreign subsidiaries resulted in a gain of $68.8 million,
    net of income taxes, in fiscal 2009. The ineffective portion of
    the net investment hedges resulted in pre-tax charges to the
    income statement of $2.2 million in fiscal 2009. The change
    in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment
    resulted in a loss of $38.3 million, net of income taxes,
    in fiscal 2011, a loss of $76.7 million, net of income
    taxes, in fiscal 2010, and a gain of $171.2 million, net of
    income taxes, in fiscal 2009. Amounts included in other
    comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges were
    reclassified to earnings as the underlying exposure on the debt
    had an impact on earnings. The net amount reclassified from
    other comprehensive income to the income statement in fiscal
    2009 related to cash flow hedges was $0.7 million, net of
    income taxes.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
    as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
    intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
    these contracts are recorded in selling, general and
    administrative expenses and are offset by marking the underlying
    item to fair value in the same period. Upon settlement, the
    realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the
    realized gains and losses of the underlying item in selling,
    general and administrative expenses. The net impact on the
    income statement of hedging activity related to these
    intercompany payables was income of $0.1 million in fiscal
    2011, income of $3.7 million in fiscal 2010 and expense of
    $1.7 million in fiscal 2009.

The fair value of TJX’s general corporate debt, including
    current installments, was estimated by obtaining market quotes
    given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
    issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
    of long-term debt at January 29, 2011 was
    $881.7 million compared to a carrying value of
    $774.4 million. The fair value of long-term debt as of
    January 30, 2010 was $862.3 million compared to a
    carrying value of $774.3 million. These estimates do not
    necessarily reflect provisions or restrictions in the various
    debt agreements that might affect TJX’s ability to settle
    these obligations.

TJX’s cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
    approximates fair value, due to the short maturities of these
    instruments.

Investments designed to meet obligations under the executive
    savings plan are invested in securities traded in active markets
    and are recorded at unadjusted quoted prices.

F-16

The foreign currency exchange contracts are valued using broker
    quotations which include observable market information. TJX does
    not make adjustments to quotes or prices obtained from brokers
    or pricing services but does assess the credit risk of
    counterparties and will adjust final valuations when
    appropriate. Where independent pricing services provide fair
    values, TJX obtains an understanding of the methods used in
    pricing. As such, these derivative instruments are classified
    within level 2.

Note H.

Segment
    Information

At January 29, 2011, TJX operated five business segments:
    three in the United States and one each in Canada and Europe.
    Each of TJX’s segments had its own administrative, buying
    and merchandising organization and distribution network. Of the
    U.S. based chains, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as
    Marmaxx, are managed together and reported as a single segment
    and A.J. Wright and HomeGoods each is reported as a separate
    segment. As a result of the consolidation of A.J. Wright, it
    will cease to be a business segment after fiscal 2012 (see
    Note C). Outside the U.S., chains in Canada (Winners,
    HomeSense and StyleSense) are under common management and
    reported as the TJX Canada segment, and chains in Europe (T.K.
    Maxx and HomeSense) are under common management and reported as
    the TJX Europe segment.

For fiscal 2011, TJX Canada and TJX Europe accounted for 23% of
    TJX’s net sales, 18% of segment profit and 23% of
    consolidated assets. All of our stores, with the exception of
    HomeGoods and HomeSense, sell family apparel and home fashions.
    The HomeGoods and HomeSense stores offer exclusively home
    fashions. By merchandise category, we derived approximately 61%
    of our sales from clothing (including footwear), 26% from home
    fashions and 13% from jewelry and accessories in fiscal 2011.

TJX evaluates the performance of its segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which it defines as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense, Provision (credit) for
    Computer Intrusion related costs, and interest expense.
    “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not
    be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be
    considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
    operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
    measure of liquidity.

    business segments:

Stock Incentive
    Plan

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
    share-based awards may be granted to its directors, officers and
    key employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
    shareholders, and all stock compensation awards are made under
    this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
    approval, provides for the issuance of up to 160.9 million
    shares with 16.9 million shares available for future grants
    as of January 29, 2011. TJX issues shares from authorized
    but unissued common stock.

Total compensation cost related to share-based compensation was
    $37.7 million, net of income taxes of $21.1 million,
    in fiscal 2011, $33.5 million, net of income taxes of
    $21.6 million, in fiscal 2010 and $31.2 million, net
    of income taxes of $20.1 million, in fiscal 2009.

As of January 29, 2011, there was $108.9 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan.
    That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of two years.

Options for the purchase of common stock have been granted at
    100% of market price on the grant date and generally vest in
    thirds over a three-year period starting one year after the
    grant, and have a ten-year term.

The fair value of options is estimated as of the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    weighted average assumptions:

Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied
    volatility from traded options on our stock, and historical
    volatility during a term approximating the expected term of the
    option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination behavior and dividend yield
    within the valuation model. Employee groups and option
    characteristics are considered separately for valuation purposes
    when applicable. No such distinctions existed during the fiscal
    years presented. The expected option life represents an estimate
    of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding
    based upon historical exercise trends. The risk-free rate is for
    periods within the contractual life of the option based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

    for such repurchased options amounted to $0.7 million in
    fiscal 2009.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $143.3 million in fiscal 2011, $109.2 million in

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Other
    Awards:

TJX has issued performance-based restricted and
    deferred stock awards under the Stock Incentive Plan which are
    issued at no cost to the recipient of the award and are subject
    to achievement of specified performance criteria for a period of
    one to three fiscal years. The grant date fair value of the
    award is charged to income ratably over the requisite service
    period during which the recipient must remain employed. The fair
    value of the awards is determined at date of grant and assumes
    that performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not
    met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized
    compensation cost is reversed.

A summary of the status of our nonvested performance-based
    restricted stock and changes during fiscal 2011 is presented
    below:

    a weighted average grant date fair value of $33.49 were granted
    in fiscal 2009. The fair value of performance-based restricted
    stock that vested was $7.0 million in fiscal 2011,
    $6.7 million in fiscal 2010 and $5.9 million in fiscal
    2009.

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under
    the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are awarded two
    annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX
    common stock valued at $50,000. One award vests immediately and
    is payable, with accumulated dividends, in stock at the earlier
    of separation from service as a director or change of control.
    The second award vests based on service as a director until the
    annual meeting that follows the award and is payable, with
    accumulated dividends, in stock at vesting date, unless an
    irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at
    the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2011,
    a total of 157,619 deferred shares were outstanding under the
    plan.

Note J.

Pension Plans and
    Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit
    retirement plan which covered a majority of its full-time
    U.S. employees hired prior to February 1, 2006. As a
    result of an amendment to the plan, employees hired after
    February 1, 2006 do not participate in this plan but are
    eligible to receive enhanced employer contributions to their
    401(k) plans. This plan amendment has not had a material impact
    on pension expense in the periods presented, but is expected to
    reduce net periodic pension costs gradually due to a reduction
    in the number of participants. Employees who had attained
    twenty-one years of age and completed one year of service prior
    to amendment were, and remain, covered under the plan. No
    employee contributions are required, and benefits are based
    principally on compensation earned in each year of service. Our
    funded defined benefit retirement plan assets are invested in
    domestic and international equity and fixed income securities,
    both directly and through investment funds. The plan does not
    invest in the securities of TJX. TJX also has an unfunded
    supplemental retirement plan which covers certain key employees
    and provides additional retirement benefits based on average
    compensation for certain of those employees or, alternatively
    based on benefits that would be provided under the funded
    retirement plan absent Internal Revenue Code limitations.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
    funded defined benefit retirement plan (funded plan) and its
    unfunded supplemental pension plan (unfunded plan) for the
    fiscal years indicated:

The consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the
    plans with any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial
    gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). The combined net accrued liability of
    $52.3 million at January 29, 2011 is reflected on the
    balance sheet as of that date as a current liability of
    $2.8 million and a long-term liability of
    $49.5 million.

The combined net accrued liability of $123.5 million at
    January 30, 2010 is reflected on the balance sheet as of
    that date as a current liability of $3.8 million and a
    long-term liability of $119.7 million.

The estimated prior service cost that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost in fiscal 2012 for both the funded and unfunded
    plan is immaterial. The estimated net actuarial loss that will
    be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2012 is
    $9.3 million for the funded plan and $0.8 million for
    the unfunded plan.

TJX determines the assumed discount rate using the Citigroup
    Pension Liability Index. TJX develops its long-term rate of
    return assumption by evaluating input from professional advisors
    taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and
    long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions.

TJX made aggregate cash contributions of $103.4 million in
    fiscal 2011, $147.9 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $2.8 million in fiscal 2009 to the defined benefit
    retirement plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded plan. The cash contributions made in fiscal
    2009 were solely to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded plan. TJX’s policy with respect to the
    qualified defined benefit plan is to fund, at a minimum, the

F-22

amount required to maintain a funded status of 80% of the
    applicable pension liability (the Funding Target) or such other
    amount sufficient to avoid restrictions with respect to the
    funding of nonqualified plans under the Internal Revenue Code.
    As a result of funding in fiscal 2011, we do not anticipate any
    required funding in fiscal 2012 for the defined benefit
    retirement plan. We anticipate making contributions of
    $3.9 million to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded plan in fiscal 2012.

Pension plan assets are reported at fair value. Investments in
    equity securities traded on a national securities exchange are
    valued at the composite close price, as reported in the Wall
    Street Journal, as of the financial statement date. This
    information is provided by the independent pricing services IDC,
    Bloomberg and Reuters.

Certain corporate and government bonds are valued at the closing
    price reported in the active market in which the bond is traded.
    Other bonds are valued based on yields currently available on
    comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
    When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar
    bonds, the bond is valued under a discounted cash flows approach
    that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of
    similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks
    that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks.
    All bonds are priced by IDC, JP Morgan and Reuters.

The investments in the limited partnerships are stated at the
    fair value of the Plan’s partnership interest based on
    information supplied by the partnerships as compared to
    financial statements of the limited partnership or other fair
    value information as determined by management. Any cash
    equivalents or short-term investments are stated at cost which
    approximates fair value.

The fair value of the investments in the Common/Collective
    trusts is determined based on net asset value as reported by
    their fund managers.

The following is a summary of our target allocation for plan
    assets along with the actual allocation of plan assets as of the

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments is used to seek to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets with a prudent
    level of risk. Risks are sought to be mitigated through asset
    diversification and the use of multiple investment managers.
    Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis
    through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability
    measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
    eligible U.S. employees and a similar type plan for
    eligible employees in Puerto Rico. Assets under the plans
    totaled $776.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $676.4 million as of December 31, 2009 and are
    invested in a variety of funds. Employees may contribute up to
    50% of eligible pay, subject to limitation. TJX matches employee
    contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at rates ranging from
    25% to 50%, based upon TJX’s performance and makes
    discretionary contributions from time to time. Employees hired
    after February 1, 2006 are eligible for participation in
    the savings plans with an enhanced matching formula beginning
    five years after hire date. TJX contributed $13.9 million
    in fiscal 2011, $13.3 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $8.6 million in fiscal 2009 to the employee savings plans.
    Employees cannot invest their

F-25

contributions in the TJX stock fund option in the plans, and may
    elect to invest up to only 50% of TJX’s contribution in the
    TJX stock fund. The TJX stock fund has no other trading
    restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents 4.7% of plan
    investments at December 31, 2010, 4.5% at December 31,
    2009 and 3.3% at December 31, 2008.

TJX also has a nonqualified savings plan for certain
    U.S. employees. TJX matches employee deferrals at various
    rates which amounted to $2.4 million in fiscal 2011,
    $1.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $425,432 in fiscal 2009.
    Although the plan is unfunded, in order to help meet its future
    obligations TJX transfers an amount equal to employee deferrals
    and the related company match to a separate “rabbi”
    trust. The trust assets, which are invested in a variety of
    mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, TJX also maintains
    retirement/deferred savings plans for eligible associates at its
    foreign subsidiaries. We contributed $5.2 million for these
    plans in fiscal 2011, $4.6 million for these plans in
    fiscal 2010 and $4.2 million in fiscal 2009.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
    medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who participate
    in its retirement plan and who retired at age 55 or older
    with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
    associates and modified the benefit to cover only retirees
    enrolled in the plan at that time. The plan amendment replaces
    the previous medical benefits with a defined amount (up to
    $35.00 per month) that approximates the cost of enrollment in
    the Medicare Plan for retirees enrolled in the plan at the time
    of modification.

TJX paid $233,000 of benefits in fiscal 2011 and will pay
    similar amounts over the next several years. The post retirement
    medical liability as of January 29, 2011 is estimated at
    $1.5 million, of which $1.3 million is included in
    non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

The amendment to plan benefits in fiscal 2006 resulted in a
    negative plan amendment of $46.8 million which is being
    amortized into income over the average remaining life of the
    active plan participants. The unamortized balance of
    $23.3 million as of January 29, 2011 is included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of which
    $3.8 million will be amortized into income in fiscal 2012.
    During fiscal 2011, there was a pre-tax net benefit of
    $3.4 million reflected in the income statement as it
    relates to this post retirement medical plan.

On April 7, 2009, TJX issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes and used the proceeds
    from the 6.95% notes offering to repurchase additional
    common stock under its stock repurchase program in fiscal 2010.
    Also in April 2009, prior to the issuance of the
    6.95% notes, TJX entered into a rate-lock agreement to
    hedge the underlying treasury rate of those notes. The cost of
    this agreement is being amortized to interest expense over the
    term of the 6.95% notes and results in an effective fixed
    rate of 7.00% on those notes.

On July 23, 2009, TJX issued $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. TJX used a portion of
    the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance its
    C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009,
    prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder,
    together with funds from operations, to repay its
    $200 million 7.45% notes due December 15, 2009,
    at maturity. Also in July 2009, prior to the issuance of the
    4.20% notes, TJX entered into a rate-lock agreement to
    hedge the underlying treasury rate on $250 million of those
    notes. The cost of this agreement is being amortized to interest
    expense over the term of the 4.20% notes and results in an
    effective fixed rate of 4.19% on the notes.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
    gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
    notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. During
    fiscal 2010, TJX called for the redemption of these notes at the
    original issue price plus accrued original issue discount, and
    462,057 notes with a carrying value of $365.1 million were
    converted into 15.1 million shares of TJX common stock at a
    rate of 32.667 shares per note. TJX paid $2.3 million
    to redeem the remaining 2,886 notes outstanding that were not
    converted. Prior to fiscal 2010, a total of 52,557 notes were
    either converted into common shares of TJX or put back to TJX.

In May 2010, TJX entered into a $500 million three-year
    revolving credit facility with similar terms and provisions as
    the $500 million facility it replaced, updated for market
    pricing. As of January 29, 2011, TJX also had a
    $500 million five-year revolving credit facility maturing
    in May 2011. The three-year agreement requires the payment of
    17.5 basis points annually on the unused committed amount.
    The five-year agreement maturing in May 2011 requires the
    payment of six basis points annually on the committed amount
    (whether used or unused). There were no U.S. short-term
    borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011. The maximum amount of
    our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $165 million during fiscal 2010. Both of these agreements
    have no compensating balance requirements, have various
    covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt
    to earnings, and serve as back up to TJX’s commercial paper
    program. There were no outstanding amounts under these credit
    facilities as of January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010.

As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010,
    TJX’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit
    facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million
    facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter
    of credit facility. As of January 29, 2011 and
    January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the
    Canadian credit line for operating expenses and there were no
    short-term borrowings during fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010. As of
    January 29, 2011, TJX Europe had a credit line of
    £20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on
    this U.K. credit line as of January 29, 2011 and
    January 30, 2010. The maximum amount outstanding under this
    U.K. line was £1.0 million in fiscal 2011 and
    £1.9 million in fiscal 2010.

The fiscal 2011 net deferred tax liability is presented on
    the balance sheet as a current asset of $66.1 million and a
    non-current liability of $241.9 million. The fiscal
    2010 net deferred tax liability is presented on the balance
    sheet as a current asset of $122.5 million and a
    non-current liability of $192.4 million. TJX has provided
    for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings from
    its Winners Canadian subsidiary, its Marshalls Puerto Rico
    subsidiary and its Italian subsidiary through January 29,
    2011. All earnings of TJX’s other foreign subsidiaries are
    considered indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. deferred
    taxes have been provided on those earnings. The net deferred tax
    liability summarized above includes deferred taxes relating to
    temporary differences at our foreign operations and amounted to
    a $20.1 million net liability as of January 29, 2011,
    and $18.9 million net liability as of January 30, 2010.

TJX established valuation allowances against certain deferred
    tax assets, primarily related to state tax net operating losses,
    which may not be realized in future years. The amount of the
    valuation allowances was $4.9 million as of
    January 29, 2011 and $3.9 million as of
    January 30, 2010.

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 38.1% for

The increase in TJX’s effective income tax rate for fiscal
    2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributed to the
    effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and the increase in
    state tax reserves, partially offset by the finalization of an
    advance pricing agreement between Canada and the United States
    and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding
    taxes. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal
    2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the
    favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction
    in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the
    settlement of several state tax audits. The absence of this
    fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in
    fiscal 2010 by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a
    reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign
    income.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, TJX adopted the tax
    accounting provisions for recognizing and measuring tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that
    affect amounts reported in the financial statements. TJX had net
    unrecognized tax benefits of $122.9 million as of
    January 29, 2011, $121.0 million as of
    January 30, 2010 and $129.9 million as of
    January 31, 2009.

Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
    items that will not impact future effective tax rates upon
    recognition. These items amount to $11.0 million as of
    January 29, 2011, $57.6 million as of January 30,
    2010 and $49.3 million as of January 31, 2009.

TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income
    tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In
    nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years through fiscal 2001 are
    no longer subject to examination.

TJX’s accounting policy is to classify interest and
    penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax
    expense. The amount of interest and penalties expensed was
    $1.9 million for the year ended January 29, 2011,
    $7.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010 and
    $15.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The
    accrued amounts for interest and penalties are
    $34.6 million as of January 29, 2011,
    $50.6 million as of January 30, 2010 and
    $51.1 million as of January 31, 2009.

Based on the final resolution of tax examinations, judicial or
    administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations
    of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other
    resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, it is reasonably
    possible that unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax
    positions taken on previously filed tax returns may change
    materially from those represented on the financial statements as
    of January 29, 2011. During the next twelve months, it is
    reasonably possible that such circumstances may occur that would
    have a material effect on previously

F-29

unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the total net amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits may decrease, which would reduce the
    provision for taxes on earnings by a range estimated at
    $1.0 million to $49.0 million.

Note M.

Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
    continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
    and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
    with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
    more five-year periods. TJX Europe generally enters leases for
    ten to fifteen years with five-or ten-year kick-out options.
    Many of our leases contain escalation clauses and some contain
    early termination penalties. In addition, we are generally
    required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating
    expenses including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage
    of sales. These expenses in the aggregate were approximately
    one-third of the total minimum rent in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010
    and fiscal 2009.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
    continuing operations as of January 29, 2011:

The capital lease relates to a 283,000-square-foot portion of
    TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments commenced
    June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease asset and
    related obligation equal to the present value of the lease
    payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
    amounted to $1,031.4 million for fiscal 2011,
    $962.0 million for fiscal 2010 and $936.6 million for
    fiscal 2009. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
    reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
    $12.0 million in fiscal 2011, $13.0 million in fiscal
    2010 and $8.3 million in fiscal 2009. Sublease income was
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2011, $1.3 million in fiscal
    2010 and $2.1 million in fiscal 2009. The total net present
    value of TJX’s minimum operating lease obligations
    approximated $5,572.6 million as of January 29, 2011.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
    $39.1 million as of January 29, 2011 and
    $37.6 million as of January 30, 2010. Letters of
    credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

Contingent
    Obligations and Contingencies

Contingent Obligations:

TJX has contingent
    obligations on leases, for which it was a lessee or guarantor,
    which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
    by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
    leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
    number of third parties. With the exception of leases of former
    businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had a
    claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do
    not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact
    on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
    We do not generally have sufficient information about these
    leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under
    them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of
    the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related
    to one or more of these leases.

TJX also has contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that TJX is able to estimate. We
    estimate that the undiscounted obligations of (i) leases of
    former operations not included in our reserve for former
    operations and (ii) properties of our former operations
    that we would expect to sublet, if the subtenants did not
    fulfill their obligations, is approximately $75 million as
    of January 29, 2011. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

TJX is a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

Contingencies:

TJX is involved from time to time
    in claims, proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Among these, TJX is a defendant in several
    lawsuits filed in federal and state courts in California, New
    York and

F-31

Texas purportedly brought as class or collective actions on
    behalf of various groups of current and former salaried and
    hourly associates in the U.S. The lawsuits allege
    violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and of state wage and
    hour statutes, including alleged misclassification of positions
    as exempt from overtime and alleged entitlement to additional
    wages for alleged

off-the-clock

work by hourly employees. The lawsuits seek unspecified monetary
    damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. TJX is
    vigorously defending these claims. At this time, TJX is not able
    to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the amount of any
    loss that may arise from them.
