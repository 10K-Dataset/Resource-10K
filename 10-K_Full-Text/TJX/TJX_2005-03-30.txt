Part I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home
fashions in the United States and worldwide. Our seven off-price
chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating
platforms. We sell off-price family apparel and home fashions
through our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the
United States, our Winners chain in Canada, and our T.K. Maxx
chain in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We sell off-price home
fashions through our HomeGoods chain in the United States and
our Canadian HomeSense chain, operated by Winners. The target
customer for all of our off-price chains, except A.J. Wright, is
the middle to upper-middle income shopper, with the same profile
as a department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets
the moderate income customer. Bob’s Stores, acquired in
December 2003, is a value-oriented, branded apparel chain based
in the Northeast United States that offers casual, family
apparel. Bob’s Stores’ target customer demographic
spans the moderate to upper-middle income bracket.

Our off-price mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and
rapidly changing assortment of brand-name merchandise at
excellent values to our customers. We define value as the
combination of quality, brand, fashion and price. With over 400
buyers and over 10,000 vendors worldwide and over 2,200 stores,
we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this
goal. Our key strengths include:

—

expertise in off-price buying

—

substantial buying power

—

synergistic businesses with flexible business model

—

solid relationships with many manufacturers and other
    merchandise suppliers

—

deep organization with decades of experience in off-price
    retailing

—

inventory management systems and distribution networks specific
    to our off-price business model

—

financial strength and an excellent credit rating

As an off-price retailer, we offer quality, name brand and
designer family apparel and home fashions every day at
substantial savings from comparable department and specialty
store regular prices. We can offer these everyday savings as a
result of our opportunistic buying strategies, disciplined
inventory management, including rapid inventory turns, and low
expense structure.

In our off-price concepts, we purchase the majority of our
inventory opportunistically. Different from traditional
retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they
appear on the selling floor, TJX buyers are in the marketplace
virtually every week. By maintaining a liquid inventory
position, our buyers can buy close to need, enabling them to buy
into current market trends and take advantage of the
opportunities in the marketplace. Due to the unpredictable
nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of
supply and demand, we are regularly able to buy the vast
majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with some
merchandise coming from retailers and others. Virtually all of
our buys for our off-price concepts are made at discounts from
initial wholesale prices. We generally purchase merchandise to
sell in the current selling season, with a limited quantity of
packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and
sell in a future selling season. We are willing to purchase less
than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and
do not ask for typical retail concessions in our off-price
chains such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances
or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or
delayed deliveries. Our financial strength, strong reputation
and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a
geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent
access to leading branded merchandise. Our opportunistic buying
permits us to consistently offer our customers a rapidly
changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are
below department and specialty store regular prices.

We are extremely disciplined in our inventory management, and we
rapidly turn the inventory in our off-price chains. We rely
heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory systems
and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of
merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution
infrastructure that supports our close-to-need buying by
delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently. For
example, highly automated storage and distribution systems
track, allocate and deliver an average of 11,000 items per week
to each T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store. In addition, specialized
computer inventory planning, purchasing and monitoring systems,
coupled with warehouse storage, processing, handling and
shipping systems, permit a continuous evaluation and rapid
replenishment of store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions
and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined



centrally, using satellite-transmitted information provided by
point-of-sale computer terminals and are designed to move
inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner.
These inventory management and distribution systems allow us to
achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of
product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted
selling periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to many other
retailers. While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy shopping
environment with emphasis on customer convenience, we do not
spend large amounts on store fixtures. Our selling floor space
is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can
easily expand and contract departments in response to customer
demand and available merchandise. Also, our large presence,
strong financial position and expertise in the real estate
market allow us to obtain favorable lease terms. In our
off-price concepts, our advertising budget as a percentage of
sales is low compared to traditional department and specialty
stores, with our advertising focused on awareness of shopping at
our stores rather than promoting particular merchandise. Our
high sales-per-square-foot productivity and rapid inventory
turnover also provide expense efficiencies.

With all of our off-price chains operating with the same
off-price strategies and systems, we are able to capitalize upon
expertise and best practices across our chains, develop
associates by transferring them from one chain to another, and
grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, we derived
81.4% of our sales from the United States (30.1% from the
Northeast, 14.5% from the Midwest, 23.1% from the South, 0.8%
from the Central Plains, and 12.9% from the West), 8.6% from
Canada, 8.8% from Europe (specifically, in the United Kingdom
and Ireland) and 1.2% from Puerto Rico.

We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. The
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed as one
division, referred to as Marmaxx, and are reported as a single
segment. The Winners and HomeSense chains, which operate
exclusively in Canada, are also managed as one division and are
reported as a single segment. Each of our other store chains,
T.K. Maxx, HomeGoods, A.J. Wright and Bob’s Stores are
reported as separate segments. More detailed information about
our segments can be found in Note N to the consolidated
financial statements.

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of
January 29, 2005, and references to store square footage
are to gross square feet. Fiscal 2003 means the fiscal year
ended January 25, 2003, fiscal 2004 means the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2004, fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year
ended January 29, 2005, and fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year
ending January 28, 2006. Our business is subject to
seasonal influences, which causes us generally to realize higher
levels of sales and income in the second half of the year. This
is common in the apparel retail business.

T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS

T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retail chain in the United
States, with 771 stores in 48 states. Marshalls is the
second-largest off-price retailer in the United States, with 683
stores in 42 states, as well as 14 stores in Puerto Rico. We
maintain the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
stores through product assortment and merchandising, marketing
and store appearance. This encourages our customers to shop at
both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls primarily target female shoppers who
have families with middle to upper-middle incomes and who
generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store
customer. These chains operate with a common buying and
merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative
functions, including finance and human resources. The combined
organization, known internally as The Marmaxx Group, offers us
increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices
and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name
merchandise at substantial discounts from department and
specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality, brand name merchandise at
prices generally 20%-60% below department and specialty store
regular prices. Both chains offer family apparel, accessories,
giftware, and home fashions. Within these broad categories, T.J.
Maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry, while
Marshalls offers a full-line footwear department and a larger
men’s department. In fiscal 2005, T.J. Maxx continued to
roll out expanded jewelry and accessories departments and
Marshalls continued to add expanded footwear departments, based
on customers’ enthusiastic response to our testing these
expanded departments in fiscal



2004. We believe these expanded offerings further differentiate
the shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, driving
traffic to both chains and we expect to continue rolling out
these expanded departments.

In fiscal 2005, we launched a T.J. Maxx e-commerce website. We
designed this website to offer online customers a shopping
experience similar to that of shopping in our stores. Our
website offers a rapidly changing selection of quality, brand
name fashions priced below department and specialty store
regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban
community shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average
approximately 30,000 square feet. Marshalls stores average
approximately 31,000 square feet. We currently expect to add a
net of 47 stores in fiscal 2006. Ultimately, we believe that
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately 1,800
stores in the United States and Puerto Rico.

HOMEGOODS

HomeGoods is our off-price retail chain that sells exclusively
home fashions with a broad array of giftware, accent furniture,
lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home.
Many of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however, we
also combine HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
store in a superstore format. We count the superstores as both a
T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store and a HomeGoods store. In fiscal
2005, we tested a superstore format of a HomeGoods store located
beside a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store, with interior passageways
providing access between the stores. This configuration is
dual-branded with both the T.J. Maxx or Marshalls logo and the
HomeGoods logo.

HomeGoods, like T.J. Maxx, also launched an e-commerce website
in fiscal 2005, with a similar off-price approach. The HomeGoods
website offers home fashions in rapidly changing assortments
priced below department and specialty store regular prices.

Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average approximately 27,000 square
feet. In superstores, which average approximately 52,000 square
feet, we dedicate an average of 21,000 square feet to HomeGoods.
The 216 stores open at year-end include 120 stand-alone stores
and 96 superstores. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add 40 stores,
including 21 superstores. We believe that the U.S. market could
support approximately 650 HomeGoods stores in the long-term.

WINNERS AND HOMESENSE

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering
off-price brand name women’s apparel and shoes, lingerie,
accessories, home fashions, giftware, fine jewelry, menswear and
children’s clothing. Winners operates HomeSense, our
Canadian off-price home-fashions chain, launched in fiscal 2002.
Like our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense offers a wide and rapidly
changing assortment of off-price home fashions including
giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and
seasonal merchandise. We operate HomeSense in a stand-alone
format, as well as a superstore format where a HomeSense store
and a Winners store are combined or operate side-by-side.

We currently operate a total of 168 Winners stores, which
average approximately 29,000 square feet and 40 HomeSense
stores, which average approximately 24,000 square feet. We
expect to add a net of 4 Winners stores and 17 HomeSense stores
in fiscal 2006, in both the stand-alone and superstore format.
Ultimately, we believe the Canadian market can support
approximately 200 Winners stores and approximately 80 HomeSense
stores.

T.K. MAXX

T.K. Maxx is the only major off-price retailer in any European
country. T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price strategies
employed by T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Winners, and offers the
same type of merchandise. We currently operate 170 T.K. Maxx
stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. T.K. Maxx stores
average approximately 28,000 square feet. T.K. Maxx opened 22
stores in the United Kingdom and one store in Ireland in fiscal
2005. We currently expect to add a total of 23 stores in the
United Kingdom and Ireland in fiscal 2006. We believe that the
U.K. and Ireland can support approximately 300 stores in the
long term.



A.J. WRIGHT

A.J. Wright, launched in fiscal 1999, brings our off-price
concept to a different demographic customer, the moderate income
shopper. A.J. Wright stores offer brand-name family apparel,
accessories, footwear, domestics, giftware, including toys and
games, and special, opportunistic purchases. A.J. Wright stores
average approximately 26,000 square feet. We added a net of 31
A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2005 and operated 130 stores at
fiscal year end. Our store growth in fiscal 2005 included
opening five stores in California, our first stores on the West
coast. We currently expect to open 25 A.J. Wright stores in
fiscal 2006. We believe this developing business offers us the
long-term opportunity to open over 1,000 A.J. Wright stores
throughout the United States.

BOB’S STORES

Bob’s Stores offers casual, family apparel and footwear
with emphasis on men’s clothing, footwear, workwear,
activewear, and licensed team apparel. Bob’s Stores’
customer demographics span the moderate to upper-middle income
bracket with a large percentage of male shoppers. With large,
high-volume stores, branded apparel selections, a value
orientation and a loyal customer base, Bob’s Stores shares
many characteristics with our off-price chains. We purchased
Bob’s Stores on December 24, 2003 and plan to grow
Bob’s Stores slowly in the short-term as we refine the
concept. Bob’s Stores average approximately 46,000 square
feet. We opened two Bob’s Stores and closed one in fiscal
2005 for a total of 32 Bob’s Stores in the Northeast United
States. We expect to open five additional Bob’s Stores in
fiscal 2006. We see the potential over time of growing
Bob’s Stores to a chain of 400 stores in the United States.



We operated stores in the following locations as of
January 29, 2005:

*

The HomeGoods store locations include the HomeGoods portion of a
    superstore.

Winners operated 168 stores in Canada: 22 in Alberta, 20 in
British Columbia, 5 in Manitoba, 3 in New Brunswick, 2 in
Newfoundland, 4 in Nova Scotia, 76 in Ontario, 1 on Prince
Edward Island, 30 in Quebec and 5 in Saskatchewan.

HomeSense operated 40 stores in Canada: 6 in Alberta, 3 in
British Columbia, 1 in New Brunswick, 26 in Ontario and 4 in
Quebec. The HomeSense store locations include the HomeSense
portion of a superstore.

T.K. Maxx operated 165 stores in the United Kingdom and 5 stores
in the Republic of Ireland.



EMPLOYEES

At January 29, 2005, we had approximately 113,000
employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per week. In
addition, we hire temporary employees during the peak
back-to-school and holiday seasons.

COMPETITION

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
competitive. Our customers focus upon fashion, quality, price,
merchandise selection and freshness, brand name recognition and,
to a lesser degree, store location. We compete with local,
regional and national department, specialty and off-price
stores. We also compete to some degree with any retailer that
sells apparel and home fashions in stores, through catalogues or
over the internet. We purchase most of our inventory
opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other
national and regional off-price apparel and outlet stores. We
also compete with other retailers for store locations.

CREDIT

Our stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry basis. Each
chain accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and
others. While we do not operate our own customer credit card
program or maintain customer credit receivables, a TJX Visa card
is offered through a major bank for our domestic divisions. The
rewards program associated with this card is partially funded by
TJX.

BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION

We operate a centralized buying organization that services both
the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, while each of our other
chains has its own centralized buying organization. All of our
chains are serviced through their own distribution networks.

TRADEMARKS

Our principal trademarks and service marks, which are
T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense,
T.K. Maxx, A.J. Wright and Bob’s Stores, are
registered in relevant countries. Our rights in these trademarks
and service marks endure for as long as they are used.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion contains forward-looking information
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in
this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the
results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to
various factors, including those discussed in Item 1 of
this report under the section entitled “Safe Harbor
Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview:

Our financial performance for the 52-week
fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005) as compared to
our 53-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (fiscal
2004) is summarized below.

—

Net sales for fiscal 2005 were $14.9 billion, a 12%
    increase over the 53-week fiscal period last year.

—

Driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx, our
    internal combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, consolidated
    same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2005 over the prior year
    on a comparable 52-to 52-week basis, with approximately


/


percentage points of this increase coming from the favorable
    effect of currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx
    businesses.

—

We increased our number of stores by 8% in fiscal 2005 ending
    the fiscal year with 2,224 stores in operation. Selling square
    footage also grew by 8% in fiscal 2005.

—

Net income for fiscal 2005 was $664.1 million compared to
    $658.4 million in the 53-week period last year. Fiscal 2005 net
    income reflects the impact of a fourth quarter, one-time,
    non-cash, after-tax charge of $19.3 million, or $.04 per
    share, relating to lease accounting (see Note A to the
    consolidated financial statements) while fiscal 2004 includes
    the benefit of the 53rd week, estimated at $24.0 million
    (after-tax), or $.05 per share. Excluding these items, net
    income would be $683.4 million in fiscal 2005 as compared
    to $634.4 million in fiscal 2004, an 8% increase. We believe
    this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable
    basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings
    trends in our business.

—

Diluted earnings per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005 as compared
    to $1.25 per share in the prior year. Excluding the items noted
    above, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.34 in
    fiscal 2005 compared to $1.20 in fiscal 2004, or an increase of
    12%. We believe this presentation reflects our earnings per
    share on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding
    the underlying earnings trends in our business.

—

Our reported operating results led to an after-tax return on
    average shareholders’ equity of 41% for the fiscal year
    ended January 29, 2005.

—

Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales)
    declined from 8.0% in fiscal 2004 to 7.2% in fiscal 2005. The
    decline was driven by cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, which increased .7% as a percent of sales over
    last year, with the cumulative charge for the adjustment of our
    lease accounting practices amounting to .2% of this increase. In
    addition, .2% of the increase was due to the favorable impact of
    the 53rd week on the prior year’s cost of sales ratio.
    Selling, general and administrative costs were up .1% as a
    percent of sales in fiscal 2005 over the prior year.

—

We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which
    allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our
    capital investment needs. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased
    25.1 million of our shares at a cost of $588 million.

—

Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at
    our distribution centers were up 1% at the end of fiscal 2005 as
    compared to the prior year end period. Our liquid inventory
    position enhances our ability to take advantage of buying
    opportunities in the marketplace.

The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at
the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an
overview of operating results by segment. All references to
earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless
otherwise indicated and diluted earnings per share for prior
periods have been adjusted to reflect the new accounting rules
relating to our contingently convertible debt. See Note A to our
consolidated financial statements.

Net sales:

Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended
January 29, 2005 totaled $14.9 billion, an 11.9%
increase over sales of $13.3 billion for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2004. Our reporting period for fiscal
2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both
fiscal 2005 and the fiscal year ended January 25, 2003
(fiscal 2003). The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added incremental



sales of approximately $200 million, as compared to fiscal
2005 and fiscal 2003. The net sales for fiscal 2004 of
$13.3 billion represented an 11.2% increase over sales of
$12.0 billion for our fiscal year ended January 25, 2003.

The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004,
reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from same store
sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of Bob’s Stores,
partially offset by approximately a 1% reduction to the growth
rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004.
Bob’s Stores was acquired on December 24, 2003 and our
sales results for fiscal 2004 include Bob’s Stores from the
date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005.
The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003
includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store
sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week.
Sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were favorably
impacted by foreign currency exchange rates.

New stores are our major source of sales growth. Our
consolidated store count increased by 7.9% in fiscal 2005 and
10.2% in fiscal 2004 over the respective prior year period. Our
selling square footage increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2005 and 9.6%
in fiscal 2004, in each case over the prior year. Bob’s
Stores is excluded from fiscal 2004 store count and selling
square footage calculations, as it was acquired late in fiscal
2004. Our acquisition of Bob’s Stores on December 24,
2003, added 31 units as of the end of fiscal 2004. Net sales for
Bob’s Stores are included in our results from the date of
acquisition. We expect to add 161 stores (net of store closings)
in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), a
7% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we
expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8%.

Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflect strong demand for jewelry and
accessories, women’s apparel and footwear, partially offset
by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home fashions. The
5% growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over
the prior year was driven by a 4% same store sales increase at
Marmaxx. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain
departments in its stores and ended the year with 303
T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/accessories
departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear
departments. These initiatives were significant factors in
Marmaxx achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005.
Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in fiscal 2004
reflects the impact of unseasonable weather in the first half of
that year. Same store sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and
fiscal 2004 benefited by approximately


/


percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which
stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned.
Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are
generally classified in the same way as the original store and
we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store
percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store
sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional
same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions,
because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange
rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their
operating performance.

The following table sets forth our consolidated operating
results as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs:

Cost
of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage
of net sales was 76.3% in fiscal 2005, 75.6% in fiscal 2004 and
75.8% in fiscal 2003. Our consolidated merchandise margin was
essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the
Marmaxx division continued to effectively execute our
merchandising and inventory management strategies, maintaining a
liquid inventory position and buying close to need, all of which
led to improved



merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved
merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by
reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which
experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in
fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to a $30.7 million
non-cash charge ($19.3 million after-tax) to conform our
lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting
principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements
under the caption “Lease Accounting.” This ratio in
fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, also reflects an
increase of approximately .2% due to the absence of the 53rd
week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week
helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004. The balance of
the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to
higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx,
which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results
in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.

The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2004 over
fiscal 2003 reflects a significant improvement in merchandise
margin, primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004. The
improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate .6%
reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio. Successful
execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and
buying closer to need led to this improvement. The contribution
from improved merchandise margin was partially offset by higher
store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to
lower-than-planned same store sales growth and higher
distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx
distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy
costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal
2004 over fiscal 2003 and distribution costs as a percentage of
net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was
favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting
period, estimated to be a .2% improvement in this ratio, as the
sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed
costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
were 16.3% in fiscal 2005 and 16.2% in both fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was
primarily due to a .1% increase in advertising costs as a
percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of Bob’s
Stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results.
Bob’s Stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio
than our off-price divisions. In comparing fiscal 2004 to fiscal
2003, store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased as
a result of the delevering impact of less-than-planned sales,
but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect
of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a pre-tax $16 million
litigation charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated
cost of settling claims related to four California lawsuits that
alleged TJX had improperly classified store managers and
assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime
laws. The lawsuits were settled in fiscal 2004 for slightly less
than $16 million.

Interest expense, net:

Interest expense, net of interest
income, was $25.8 million in fiscal 2005, $27.3 million in
fiscal 2004 and $25.4 million in fiscal 2003. Interest
income was $7.7 million in fiscal 2005, $6.5 million
in fiscal 2004 and $10.5 million in fiscal 2003. The
reduction in interest income in fiscal 2005 and 2004 as compared
to fiscal 2003 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest
rates.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate was
38.5% in fiscal 2005, 38.4% in fiscal 2004 and 38.3% in fiscal
2003. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal
2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and the increase in this rate in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 were primarily due to
increases in state income tax rates. The effective income tax
rate for fiscal 2003 also reflects the favorable effect of the
tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in
exchange for the termination of split-dollar arrangements as
described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) enacted on
October 22, 2004 will allow companies to repatriate the
undistributed foreign earnings of their foreign operations in
fiscal 2006 at an effective rate of 5.25%. The Company is
evaluating the impact of the act on TJX.

Net income:

Net income was $664.1 million in fiscal
2005, $658.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $578.4 million
in fiscal 2003. Net income per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005,
$1.25 in fiscal 2004 and $1.05 in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings
per share reflect the impact of retroactive implementation of a
new accounting pronouncement that requires the inclusion of
shares associated with contingently convertible debt in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share even if the
contingencies have not been met. This accounting change had an
adverse effect of $.04 on our diluted earnings per share in
fiscal 2005 and $.03 on previously reported diluted earnings per
share in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Net income for fiscal 2005
includes the after-tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative
pre-tax charge associated with our lease accounting practices,
which reduced net income in fiscal 2005 by $19.3 million,
or $.04 per share. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004
added approximately $24 million to net income and $.05 to
our



earnings per share, and that favorable changes in currency
exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added
approximately $.02 to our earnings per share in each year. The
increase in earnings per share, on a percentage basis in all
periods, increased more than the related earnings as a result of
the impact of our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2005
we repurchased 25.1 million shares of our stock at a cost
of $588 million and we plan to continue our share
repurchase program in fiscal 2006 with planned purchases of
approximately $600 million.

Segment information:

The following is a discussion of the
operating results of our business segments. We consider each of
our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the
performance of our segments based on “segment profit or
loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before general
corporate expense and interest expense, net. “Segment
profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In
addition, this measure of performance should not be considered
an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
liquidity. More detailed information about our segments,
including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss”
to “income before provision for income taxes” can be
found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements.

Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each
segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating
to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial
statements under the caption “Lease Accounting.”

Marmaxx posted a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005,
compared to a 1% decrease in same store sales for fiscal 2004.
Same store sales growth was driven by strong sales in the
jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, as well as
women’s sportswear, with fashion trends in these categories
helping to drive customer demand. Sales for men’s apparel
and home fashions in fiscal 2005 were soft. Same store sales
benefited from the continuation of the Marmaxx program whereby
certain departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were
expanded. Marmaxx ended fiscal 2005 with 303 T.J. Maxx
stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67
Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared
to 5 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories
departments and 5 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear
departments at the end of fiscal 2004. These initiatives drove
overall sales in the stores with the expanded departments in
addition to increasing sales in these categories and were
significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same stores sales
increase in fiscal 2005. Segment profit increased to 9.8% in
fiscal 2005 from 9.7% in fiscal 2004, despite the impact of a
$16.8 million charge for its share of the cumulative impact
of the lease accounting adjustment. The lease accounting charge
reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by .2%. Marmaxx
continued to effectively execute its merchandising and inventory
strategies, aggressively managing the liquidity of its inventory
and buying and shipping goods close to need, all of which led to
strong markon and improved merchandise margins. For fiscal 2005,
merchandise margins increased .4%. Marmaxx also continued to
effectively manage expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements
in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in
occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which
represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment
profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 is also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in
the fiscal 2004 reporting period described below.

The increase in segment profit and profit margin for fiscal 2004
as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects Marmaxx’s sharp
execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and
effective expense controls in fiscal 2004. Marmaxx was able to
buy closer to need in fiscal 2004, leading to a strong markon
and an improved merchandise margin, especially in the second
half of the year. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated
favorable impact of .2% on the segment profit margin for that
year, as the sales volume from this



extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. The increase in
segment profit and segment profit margin in fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 also reflect the effect of higher costs
in fiscal 2003 due to the $16 million litigation charge
discussed above.

We added a net of 50 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in
fiscal 2005 and increased total selling square footage of the
division by 4%. We expect to open a net of 47 new stores in
fiscal 2006, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and to
increase the selling square footage of the division by 4%. We
plan to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in
approximately 267 existing T.J. Maxx stores as well as all new
T.J. Maxx stores and to add approximately 56 expanded footwear
departments in existing and new Marshalls stores.

WINNERS AND HOMESENSE:

Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners and HomeSense,
our Canadian businesses, increased by 4% in both fiscal 2005 and
fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage
of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a $3.5 million charge
for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the
lease accounting adjustment. The growth in the Winners segment
profit in fiscal 2005 over the prior year was due to favorable
currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin for fiscal
2005 of 8.5% was 1.4% below fiscal 2004 segment profit margin,
primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which decreased .9%
from the prior year, primarily driven by markdowns. Sales in the
second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first
half, primarily due to unseasonable weather and a promotional
retail environment. This, along with Winners buying based on the
strength of its first half sales, resulted in excess
inventories, requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns
to clear merchandise in the second half of the year. The lease
accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by .2% with the
balance of the segment profit margin reduction coming largely
from the increasing impact of HomeSense on the division’s
combined results. HomeSense is at an earlier stage of
development and therefore operates with higher expense ratios
than does Winners.

Winners and HomeSense segment profit in fiscal 2004 increased
25% over the segment profit in fiscal 2003. Approximately
two-thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over
fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Winners and HomeSense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was
below that of fiscal 2003. This reduction reflects increased
markdowns at Winners and the increasing impact of HomeSense on
their combined results.

We opened 8 Winners stores and 15 HomeSense stores in fiscal
2005, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 13%. We
expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 17 HomeSense stores in
fiscal 2006, increasing our total Canadian store base by 10%,
and increasing selling square footage by 10%. The store counts
include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this
division’s superstores which either combine a Winners store
with a HomeSense store or operates them side-by-side. As of
January 29, 2005 we operated 11 superstores and expect to
have a total of 23 superstores at the end of fiscal 2006.



T.K. MAXX:

T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland had a
same store sales increase of 3% (in local currency) in fiscal
2005 on top of a 6% increase in fiscal 2004. T.K. Maxx’s
same store sales in fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by
unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and
a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of
the year. In light of the retail environment under which T.K.
Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was effective in
managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on
segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment profit as a
percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a
$6.5 million charge for T.K. Maxx’s share of the
cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The
significant growth in T.K. Maxx’s segment profit in fiscal
2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the
favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. The
segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased .6% to 5.4%,
primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of .7% as a
percentage of sales, of which .5% was attributable to the
cumulative lease accounting charge.

Segment profit for fiscal 2004 increased 37% over the segment
profit for fiscal 2003 with approximately one-quarter of this
growth coming from currency exchange rates. The strong segment
performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxx’s strong
execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies.

We added 23 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2005, and increased
the division’s selling square footage by 23%. Selling
square footage was favorably impacted by the addition of
mezzanines in some of our existing stores. We plan to open an
additional 23 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006, and expand
selling square footage by 20%.

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2005,
compared to a 1% increase in fiscal 2004. Segment profit and
segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a
$2.2 million charge for HomeGoods’ share of the
cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment.
HomeGoods’ segment profit declined from $49.8 million in
fiscal 2004 to $23.1 million in fiscal 2005. The business
was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion
product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to
a modest 1% same store sales increase. Consequently, the
division took additional markdowns, which contributed to a 1.8%
reduction in its merchandise margin. The decline in segment
profit margin from 5.7% in fiscal 2004 to 2.3% in fiscal 2005 is
primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment
profit margin was also impacted by a .9% increase in occupancy
costs as a percentage of net sales (including .2% due to the
lease accounting charge) and a .7% increase in distribution
center



costs as a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio
increases reflect the negative impact on expense ratios of a 1%
same store sales increase.

In fiscal 2004, segment profit increased 55% over the segment
profit of fiscal 2003 despite only a modest 1% increase in same
store sales in fiscal 2004. HomeGoods’ segment profit
margin reflected the solid execution of its merchandising and
inventory strategies in fiscal 2004, and a reduction in
distribution and administrative expenses as the business
expanded over fiscal 2003.

We opened a net of 34 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2005, a 19%
increase, and increased selling square footage of the division
by 17%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add a net of 40 new HomeGoods
stores (including freestanding and superstore formats) and
increase selling square footage by 19%.

A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2005
compared to an 8% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2004.
Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales
include a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wright’s share
of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We
believe that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to
economic factors, such as higher energy costs, and that this had
an impact on the division’s sales performance in fiscal
2005. We also believe that a weaker demand in urban fashion
trends impacted sales during the year. These sales trends caused
us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to
reposition our merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal
2005 reflects a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%,
primarily due to this higher markdown activity. We believe that
the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005, especially later in
the year, may have been too aggressive for this young division,
and placed a strain on operations. In addition, the
lower-than-planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively
impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center
costs and store payroll. Distribution center costs were also
impacted by expense increases relating to A.J. Wright’s new
distribution facility in Indiana.

In fiscal 2004, the improvement in A.J. Wright’s segment
profit, as compared to fiscal 2003, was primarily due to the
impact of improved merchandising and strong inventory
management, which led to improved merchandise margins. Segment
profit for fiscal 2004 also included a $1.7 million gain in
connection with an agreement to vacate a store property.

We added 31 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2005, increasing
selling square footage by 32%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add 25
new stores and increase selling square footage by 20%.

BOB’S STORES:

Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bob’s Stores
as a TJX division. Bob’s Stores now operates 32 stores
and recorded fiscal 2005 sales of $290.6 million and a segment
loss of $17.3 million. In fiscal 2005, we built the
Bob’s Stores organization and we continued to refine the
concept, including repositioning the division’s promotional
activity, improving its inventory management, fine tuning its
product assortment and testing a smaller store size. For fiscal
2006, we plan to open 5 Bob’s Stores and increase selling
square footage by 15%.



GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE:

General corporate expense

$

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are
those costs not specifically related to the operations of our
business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate
office, including the compensation and benefits for senior
corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the
non-divisional departments for accounting and budgeting,
internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk
management, legal, human resources and systems; and the
occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the
corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes
the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non-operating
costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual
divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of income.

The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over
the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains
and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative
contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany
activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005
reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental
audit fees and costs related to the start-up of our e-commerce
businesses. This increase was offset in part by a
$6.3 million reduction in contributions to The TJX
Foundation in fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004.

The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of contributions to The TJX
Foundation of $9.8 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003,
there were no contributions to The TJX Foundation. This increase
in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change
in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging
activity. The majority of this item relates to derivative
contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency
exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany
activity. The changes in the fair value of the contracts are
reflected currently in earnings. In fiscal 2003 and for the
first nine months of fiscal 2004, the realized gains or losses
on these contracts were allocated to the appropriate division at
the time the contracts were settled. Effective with the fourth
quarter ended January 31, 2004 we began including the
unrealized values of these contracts within the individual
segments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$1,079.8 million in fiscal 2005, $770.5 million in
fiscal 2004, and $908.6 million in fiscal 2003. The cash
generated from operating activities each of these fiscal years
is largely due to strong operating earnings. The difference in
net cash provided from operating activities from year to year is
largely driven by the change in inventory, net of accounts
payable, from prior year-end levels. In fiscal 2005 this change
in net inventory position resulted in a use of cash of $85.3
million compared to $191.8 million in fiscal 2004 and
$40.1 million in fiscal 2003. Average per store
inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution
centers, at January 29, 2005 increased only 1% compared to
the prior year, whereas inventories per store at
January 31, 2004 were up 11% compared to the prior year.
This change in net inventory position and the trend in inventory
levels per store reflect our decision to raise the level of
store inventories in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 levels and to
maintain them at fiscal 2004 levels in fiscal 2005. Effective
with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to
accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is
shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. This
accrual as of January 29, 2005 increased both inventory and
accounts payable by $237 million and thus had no impact on
cash flow from operations.

The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2005 were
also impacted by a larger increase in accrued expenses and other
liabilities than in fiscal 2004, reflecting increased accruals
at the end of fiscal 2005 for rent and landlord allowances,
property additions, gift cards and payroll. The cash flows from
operating activities for fiscal 2004 were impacted by a smaller
increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities at the end of
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, reflecting reduced
accruals for property additions and the payment of the
California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The change in accrued
expenses and other liabilities also reflects cash expenditures
of $7.1 million in fiscal 2005, $37.2 million in
fiscal 2004, and $32.2 million in fiscal 2003 charged
against our discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more
detail below.



Operating cash flows in fiscal 2005, and to a greater extent in
fiscal 2004, were favorably affected by deferred tax benefits
related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve
and increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed
for U.S. income tax purposes. Cash flows from operating
activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified
pension fund of $25.0 million in fiscal 2005, $17.5 million
in fiscal 2004 and $58.0 million in fiscal 2003. All of the
contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003
were made on a voluntary basis.

Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a reserve for
potential future obligations of discontinued operations that
relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX businesses
that have been sold or spun off. The reserve reflects TJX’s
estimation of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely
to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or
guarantor of the leases when the assignees of the leases filed
for bankruptcy, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease
obligations.

At January 29, 2005, substantially all leases of
discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies
and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had
been resolved. It is possible that there will be future costs
for leases from these discontinued operations that were not
terminated or have not expired. We do not expect to incur any
material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess
of our reserve. The reserve balance amounted to
$12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and
$17.5 million as of January 31, 2004.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of
BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have contingent
obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor,
which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a
claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do
not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We do not generally have sufficient information about these
leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under
them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note K to the
consolidated financial statements, and properties of our
discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants
did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
$120 million as of January 29, 2005. We believe that
most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table
below:

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate

$168 million for new stores, $262 million for store
renovations, expansions and improvements and $100 million
for our office and distribution centers. Our planned rate of
growth in selling square footage per year is approximately 8%,
on a consolidated basis, for the next several years. Our rate of
store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of
existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in
planned capital expenditures.

Investing activities for fiscal 2004 includes a net cash outflow
of $57.1 million to acquire Bob’s Stores as discussed in
Note B to the consolidated financial statements.

Financing activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
outflows of $587.6 million in fiscal 2005, $546.8 million
in fiscal 2004, and $509.1 million in fiscal 2003. The
majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program.

We spent $594.6 million in fiscal 2005, $520.7 million
in fiscal 2004, and $481.7 million in fiscal 2003 under our
stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.1 million
shares in fiscal 2005, 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004,
and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2003. All shares
repurchased were retired with the exception of 75,000 shares
purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal
2003, which are held in treasury. During May 2004, we completed
a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our
intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common
stock. Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock
repurchase program, as of January 29, 2005, we have
repurchased 17.7 million shares at a total cost of
$406.6 million under this program. All of these repurchased
share numbers reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed in
May 2002.

Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments
on long-term debt of $5 million in fiscal 2005, and
$15 million in fiscal 2004.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
totaled $.18 per share in fiscal 2005, $.14 per share in fiscal
2004, and $.12 per share in fiscal 2003. Cash payments for
dividends on our common stock totaled $83.4 million in fiscal
2005, $68.9 million in fiscal 2004, and $60.0 million
in fiscal 2003. Financing activities also include proceeds of
$96.9 million in fiscal 2005, $59.2 million in fiscal
2004, and $33.9 million in fiscal 2003 from the exercise of
employee stock options. These stock option exercises, along with
vesting of restricted stock awards, also provided tax benefits
of $20.9 million in fiscal 2005, $13.6 million in
fiscal 2004, and $11.8 million in fiscal 2003. These tax
benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million
five-year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2005 we
renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for
$330 million. Effective March 17, 2005, we extended
the 364-day agreement until July 15, 2005, with
substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original
facility remaining unchanged. We anticipate that during the year
we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size
of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity.
The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances,
however, TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we
believe that non-compliance with these covenants is remote. The
revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial
paper program. As of January 29, 2005 there were no
outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum
amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
$5 million during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during
fiscal 2004. There were no short-term borrowings during fiscal
2003. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term
borrowings was 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004. As
of January 29, 2005, we had credit lines totaling
C$20 million for our Canadian subsidiary. The maximum
amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line was
C$6.8 million during fiscal 2005, C$5.6 million in
fiscal 2004, and C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003. The funding
requirements of our Canadian operations were largely provided by
TJX.

We believe that our current credit facilities are more than
adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the
consolidated financial statements for further information
regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources.



Contractual obligations:

As of January 29, 2005, we

The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero
coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options
in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available
to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised
and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will
mature in fiscal 2022.

The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent
and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and
common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay.
These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum
rent for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005.

Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for
merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies
and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for
maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under a
limited number of executive employment agreements. We excluded
long-term agreements for services and operating needs that can
be cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities that do not have specified
maturity dates. Included in other long-term liabilities is
$125.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most
of which will come due beyond five years and $115.3 million
for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are
included in the lease commitments in the above table.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We
consider our most critical accounting policies, involving
management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to
inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance,
and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the
most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and
that the results we would have obtained, had alternative
assumptions been selected, would not be materially different
from the results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for valuing
inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail
method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are
determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it
to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in
the retail industry and involves management estimates with
regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A
significant factor involves the recording and timing of
permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent
markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the
price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method
results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other
accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice,
we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be
taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates.
Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for
interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at
fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and
estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results,
but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe
that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent
markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each
fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is
fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with
vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain
conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory.
Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such
arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the
value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have
vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising
dollars if certain



conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on
Bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial
to our consolidated results.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are accrued over
the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate
obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future
and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make
assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for
valuing pension obligations and the long-term rate of return
assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the
net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate,
which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has
dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on
pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 were
considerably less than our expected returns. These two factors
can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement
benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on
the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made
contributions of $100.5 million, which exceeded the minimum
required, over the last three years to largely restore the
funded status of our plan.

Casualty insurance:

The nature of our casualty insurance
program for certain fiscal periods, primarily fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, carries a deductible that exposes TJX to losses for
casualty claims in excess of our estimated annual cost of such
losses. The accrual for our estimated losses requires us, with
the aid of an actuarial service and based upon claims experience
of TJX and other factors, to make significant estimates and
assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A
large portion of these losses are funded during the policy year,
offsetting our estimated loss accruals. The Company has a net
accrual of $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of its
casualty losses as of January 29, 2005.

Accounting for taxes:

Like many large corporations, we
are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state,
local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes
and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the
potential exposure associated with the various tax filing
positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on
the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have
appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible
exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which
accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in
excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial
period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue
Service is currently examining the fiscal years ended January
2000 through January 2003 and we also have various state and
foreign tax examinations in process.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the cost
of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based
compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial
statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on
the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be
recognized over the period during which an employee is required
to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite
service period (usually the vesting period). This Statement is
effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first
interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005 (our third quarter of fiscal 2006). We
disclose the pro forma impact of expensing stock options in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 as originally issued in our
notes to the consolidated financial statements and we are still
assessing the impact that SFAS No. 123R will have on our
financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these
items to be recognized as current-period charges. SFAS
No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier
application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this
Statement will have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of
exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception
from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB 29 and replaces
it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
substance. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this
Statement will have any material impact on our financial
statements.



On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position
No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which addresses
the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to
arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) enacted on
December 8, 2003. We are in the process of determining if
our plan is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and our
disclosed postretirement medical cost of $6.7 million for
fiscal 2005 has not been reduced by any federal subsidy. We do
not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be
material.

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
(T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D
to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant
portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency
forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or
losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed
with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in
currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into
derivatives for speculative trading purposes.

In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large
portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject
to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We
allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to
minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties.

ITEM
7A.                QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
(T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D
to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant
portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative
contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We
utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset
the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts
are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have
performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to
the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described
above. As of January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that
such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain
lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in
interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company.
We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our
cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily
fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical
10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum
variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of
January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that such an
adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

ITEM
9A.                CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

(a)     Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

The Company carried out an evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this report, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Company’s management, including
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in ensuring that all information required to be filed in this
annual report was recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time period required by the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There have been no changes in internal controls over financial
reporting, that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting.

(b)     Management’s Annual Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of TJX is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting as of January 29, 2005 based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation,
management concluded that its internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 29, 2005.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated
financial statements of The TJX Companies, Inc., has audited
management’s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting as of January 29, 2005, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For Fiscal Years Ended January 29, 2005, January 31,
2004 and January 25, 2003

F-1


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The TJX Companies,
Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of The TJX Companies,
Inc’s 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of January 29,
2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) at January 29, 2005
and January 31, 2004, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January 29, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note A, in fiscal 2005 the Company changed its
method for reporting diluted earnings per share by adopting EITF
Issue No. 04-8 “The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.” All earnings per share
amounts presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of
this change.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
“Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January 29, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 29,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial

F-2


statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

A.     Summary of Accounting
Policies

Basis of Presentation

: The consolidated financial
statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
“TJX”, the “Company” or “we”)
include the financial statements of all of TJX’s
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of TJX’s
activities are conducted within TJX or our subsidiaries and are
consolidated in these financial statements. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The notes
pertain to continuing operations except where otherwise noted.

Fiscal Year

: TJX’s fiscal year ends on the last
Saturday in January. The fiscal year ended January 31, 2004
(“fiscal 2004”) included 53 weeks. The fiscal
years ended January 29, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”) and
January 25, 2003 (“fiscal 2003”) each included
52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share

: All earnings per share amounts
discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise
indicated.

In October 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) reached a consensus that EITF Issue No.
04-08, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on
Diluted Earnings per Share” would be effective for
reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. This
accounting pronouncement affects the company’s treatment,
for earnings per share purposes, of its $517.5 million zero
coupon convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001.
The notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of TJX
common stock if the sale price of our stock reaches certain
levels or other contingencies are met. Prior to this reporting
period, the 16.9 million shares were excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation because criteria for conversion
had not been met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that shares
associated with contingently convertible debt be included in
diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether
contingent conversion conditions have been met. EITF Issue
No. 04-08 also requires that diluted earnings per share for
all prior periods be restated to reflect this change. As a
result, diluted earnings per share for all periods presented
(including pro forma amounts) reflect the assumed conversion of
our convertible subordinated notes as well as the May 2002
two-for-one stock split.

Lease Accounting

: During fiscal 2005 we recorded a
one-time non-cash charge to conform our accounting policies to
generally accepted accounting principles related to the timing
of rent expense for certain leased locations. Previously, we
began recording rent expense at the time a store opened and the
lease term commenced as specified in the lease. Beginning in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we record rent expense when we
take possession of a store, which occurs before the commencement
of the lease term, as specified in the lease, and generally 30
to 60 days prior to the opening of the store. This will
result in an acceleration of the commencement of rent expense
for each lease, as we record rent expense during the pre-opening
period, but a reduction in monthly rent expense, as the total
rent due under the lease is amortized over a greater number of
months.

This correction resulted in a one-time, cumulative, non-cash
charge of $30.7 million on a pre tax basis ($19.3 million
net of tax), or $.04 per share, which we recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005.

The following is the cumulative effect of the correction by
operating segment (in thousands):

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of the financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as
the reported amounts of revenues and

F-8


expenses during the reporting period. TJX considers the more
significant accounting policies that involve management
estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory
valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, and
accounting for taxes. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue Recognition

: TJX records revenue at the time of
sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of a
reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
customer receives layaway merchandise.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications

: Cost
of sales, including buying and occupancy costs include the cost
of merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory-related
derivative contracts; store occupancy costs (including real
estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs, and fixed asset
depreciation); the costs of operating our distribution centers;
payroll, benefits and travel costs directly associated with
buying inventory; and systems costs related to the buying and
tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
related foreign currency exchange contracts and other gains or
losses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

: TJX generally considers highly
liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. Our investments are primarily
high-grade commercial paper, institutional money market funds
and time deposits with major banks. The fair value of cash
equivalents approximates carrying value.

Merchandise Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for valuing
inventories on the first-in first-out basis. We almost
exclusively utilize a permanent markdown strategy and lower the
cost value of the inventory that is subject to markdown at the
time the retail prices are lowered in our stores. Effective with
the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we have begun to
accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is
shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. At
January 29, 2005, the amount of in-transit inventory
included in merchandise inventories and accounts payable on the
balance sheet was $236.9 million.

Common Stock and Equity

: TJX’s equity transactions
consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
our stock repurchase program and the issuance of common stock
under our stock incentive plan. Under the stock repurchase
program we repurchase our common stock on the open market. The
par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock
with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged
against any available additional paid-in capital
(“APIC”) and the balance charged to retained earnings.
Due to the high volume of repurchases over the past several
years we have no remaining balance in APIC. Virtually all shares
are retired when purchased. We have 250,276 shares held in
treasury which are reflected as a reduction to common stock
outstanding.

Shares issued under our stock incentive plan are generally
issued from authorized but previously unissued shares, and
proceeds received are recorded by increasing common stock for
the par value of the shares with the excess over par added to
APIC. Income tax benefits due to the exercise of stock options
are also added to APIC and included with the proceeds received
from the option exercise. The income tax benefits are included
in cash flows from operating activities in the statements of
cash flows. The par value and excess of the fair value over par
value of restricted stock awards are also added to common stock
and APIC with an offsetting amount recorded in unearned stock
compensation. The amount included in unearned stock compensation
is amortized into earnings over the vesting period of the
related award.

TJX has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and
continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” in accounting for compensation expense under
our stock option plan. TJX grants options at fair market value
on the date of the grant, accordingly no compensation expense
has been recognized for the stock options issued during fiscal
2005, 2004 or 2003. Compensation expense determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 123, net of related income tax
effect, amounted to $60.1 million, $55.2 million and
$41.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

F-9


Presented below are the unaudited pro forma net income and
related earnings per share showing the effect that stock
compensation expense, determined in accordance with SFAS
No. 123, would have on reported results.

For purposes of applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123 for
the pro forma calculations, the fair value of each option
granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: dividend yield of .8% in fiscal 2005,
..6% in fiscal 2004 and .5% in fiscal 2003; volatility of 35%,
43% and 44% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; a
risk-free interest rate of 3.4% in fiscal 2005, 3.3% in fiscal
2004 and 3.5% in fiscal 2003; and an expected holding period of
4.5 years in fiscal 2005 and six years in fiscal 2004 and
2003. The weighted average fair value of options granted during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $6.96, $8.75 and $8.93 per share,
respectively.

Interest

: TJX’s interest expense, net was
$25.8 million, $27.3 million and $25.4 million in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. Interest expense is
presented net of interest income of $7.7 million,
$6.5 million and $10.5 million in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. We capitalize interest during the active
construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized
interest is added to the cost of the related assets. No interest
was capitalized in fiscal 2005. We capitalized interest of
$1.0 million and $559,000 in fiscal 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Debt discount and related issue expenses are
amortized to interest expense over the lives of the related debt
issues or to the first date the holders of the debt may require
TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and Amortization

: For financial reporting
purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and amortization of
property by the use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated
over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are
generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 10
years. Depreciation and amortization expense for property was
$268.0 million for fiscal 2005, $227.3 million for
fiscal 2004, and $196.4 million for fiscal 2003.
Amortization expense for property held under a capital lease was
$2.2 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant costs
incurred for internally developed software are capitalized and
amortized over three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the
cost of disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation
are eliminated and any gain or loss is included in net income.
Pre-opening costs, including rent, are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: TJX periodically reviews
the value of its property and intangible assets in relation to
the current and expected operating results of the related
business segments in order to assess whether there has been a
permanent impairment of their carrying values. An impairment
exists when the undiscounted cash flow of an asset is less than
the carrying cost of that asset. Store by store impairment
analysis is performed, at a minimum on an annual basis, in the
fourth quarter of a fiscal year.

Goodwill and Tradenames

: Goodwill is primarily the excess
of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
T.J. Maxx chain and is included in the Marmaxx segment at
January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. In addition,
goodwill includes the excess of cost over the estimated fair
market value of the net assets of Winners acquired by TJX in
fiscal 1991.

F-10


Goodwill, net of amortization, totaled $71.8 million,
$71.4 million and $71.5 million as of January 29,
2005, January 31, 2004 and January 25, 2003,
respectively, and through January 26, 2002 was being
amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis. There was
no amortization of goodwill in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Cumulative amortization as of January 29, 2005, was
$33.0 million, and was $32.9 million at both
January 31, 2004 and January 25, 2003. Changes in
goodwill cost and accumulated amortization are attributable to
the effect of exchange rate changes on Winners reported goodwill.

Tradenames include the values assigned to the name
“Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 in the
acquisition of the Marshalls chain, and to the name
“Bob’s Stores” acquired by TJX in December 2003
when we acquired substantially all of the assets of Bob’s
Stores (see Note B). These values were determined by the
discounted present value of assumed after-tax royalty payments,
offset by a reduction for their pro-rata share of negative
goodwill.

The Marshalls tradename, net of accumulated amortization prior
to the implementation of SFAS No. 142 in fiscal 2003, is
carried at a value of $107.7 million, is considered to have
an indefinite life and accordingly, is no longer amortized. The
Bob’s Stores tradename, pursuant to the purchase accounting
method, was valued at $4.8 million which is being amortized
over 10 years. Amortization expense of $483,000 and $33,000
was recognized in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cumulative
amortization as of January 29, 2005 and January 31,
2004 was $516,000 and $33,000, respectively.

The Company occasionally acquires other trademarks in connection
with private label merchandise. Such trademarks are included in
other assets and are amortized to cost of sales, including
buying and occupancy costs over the term of the agreement
generally from 7 to 10 years. Amortization expense related
to trademarks was $492,000, $519,000, and $369,000 in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company had
$2.7 million, $3.0 million and $3.2 million in
trademarks, net of accumulated amortization, at January 29,
2005, January 31, 2004 and January 25, 2003,
respectively. Trademarks and the related amortization are
included in the related operating segment for which they were
acquired.

An impairment analysis is performed for goodwill and tradenames,
at a minimum on an annual basis, in the fourth quarter of a
fiscal year. No impairments have been recorded on these assets
to date.

Advertising Costs

: TJX expenses advertising costs as
incurred. Advertising expense was $188.0 million,
$148.4 million, and $135.3 million for fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

: TJX’s foreign assets
and liabilities are translated at the fiscal year end exchange
rate. Activity of the foreign operations that affect the
statements of income and cash flows are translated at the
average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. The
translation adjustments associated with the foreign operations
are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustments included in
shareholders’ equity amounted to a gain of
$10.7 million, net of related tax effect of
$12.2 million, as of January 29, 2005; a gain of
$21.4 million, net of related tax effect of
$16.3 million, as of January 31, 2004; and a gain of
$6.2 million, as of January 25, 2003.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

: TJX enters
into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing and
to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities in the statements of financial
position and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes
to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify
for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the period of
the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either recorded
in shareholders’ equity as a component of other
comprehensive income or are recognized currently in earnings,
along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis of the
item being hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on derivatives
that have hedged our net investment in foreign operations and
deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a loss of
$36.9 million, net of related tax effects of
$24.6 million at January 29, 2005; a loss of
$35.0 million, net of related tax effects of
$23.3 million as of January 31, 2004; and amounted to
a loss of $9.4 million as of January 25, 2003.

New Accounting Standards

: In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) which
requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as
other equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in
the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of
the awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That
cost will be recognized over the period

F-11


during which an employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually
the vesting period). This Statement is effective for public
entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual
reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 (our third
quarter of fiscal 2006). We disclose the pro forma impact of
expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123, as
originally issued, in our notes to the consolidated financial
statements and we are still assessing the impact that SFAS
No. 123R will have on our financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these
items to be recognized as current-period charges. SFAS
No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier
application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this
Statement will have any material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of
exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception
from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB 29 and replaces it
with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
substance. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this
Statement will have any material impact on our financial
statements.

On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position
No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which addresses
the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to
arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) enacted on
December 8, 2003. We are in the process of determining if
our plan is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and our
disclosed postretirement medical cost of $6.7 million for
fiscal 2005 has not been reduced by any federal subsidy. We do
not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be
material.

B.     Acquisition of Bob’s
Stores

On December 24, 2003, TJX completed the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented retail chain in the
Northeast United States. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement,
TJX purchased substantially all of the assets of Bob’s
Stores, including one owned location, and assumed leases for 30
of Bob’s Stores locations, its Meriden, Connecticut office
and warehouse lease, along with specified operating contracts
and customer, vendor and employee obligations. The purchase
price, which is net of proceeds received from a third party,
amounted to $57.6 million.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” Accordingly, the purchase price is allocated
to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets
acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess
purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill and
conversely, the excess fair value over purchase price,
“negative goodwill,” is allocated as a reduction to
the long-lived assets. The purchase accounting method allows a
one year period to finalize the fair values of the net assets
acquired. No further adjustments to fair market values are made
after that point.

The initial allocation of the purchase price resulted in the
allocation of $2.4 million of negative goodwill. Subsequent to
our fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, it was determined
that additional inventory related obligations should have been
reflected on the

F-12


opening balance sheet, which essentially eliminated the negative
goodwill. The following table presents the final allocation of
the $57.6 million purchase price to the assets and
liabilities acquired based on their fair values as of
December 24, 2003:

tradename “Bob’s Stores,” which is being
amortized over 10 years.

The results of Bob’s Stores have been included in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Pro forma results of operations assuming the acquisition of
Bob’s Stores occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2004
have not been presented, as the inclusion of the results of
operations for the acquired business would not have produced a
material impact on the reported sales, net income or earnings
per share of the Company.

C.     Long-Term Debt and Credit
Lines

The table below presents long-term debt, exclusive of current
installments, as of January 29, 2005 and January 31,
2004. All amounts are net of unamortized debt discounts. Capital
lease obligations are separately presented in Note E.

F-13


The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of current
installments at January 29, 2005 are as follows:

The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero
coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options
in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available
to them in fiscal 2014. Any of the notes on which put options
are not exercised, redeemed or converted will mature in fiscal
2022.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the notes
represents a yield to maturity of 2% per year. Due to provisions
of the first put option on February 13, 2002, we amortized
the debt discount assuming a 1.5% yield for fiscal 2002. The
notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior
indebtedness of TJX. The notes are convertible into
16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale
price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the
credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the
notes are called for redemption or if certain specified
corporate transactions occur. The holders of the notes have the
right to require us to purchase the notes for $391.7 million and
$441.3 million on February 13, 2007 and 2013,
respectively. The repurchase amounts represent original purchase
price plus accrued original issue discount. We may pay the
purchase price in cash, TJX stock or a combination of the two.
If the holders exercise their put options, we expect to fund the
payment with cash, financing from our short-term credit
facility, new long-term borrowings or a combination thereof. At
the put date on February 13, 2004, three of the notes were
put to TJX. In addition, if a change in control of TJX occurs on
or before February 13, 2007, each holder may require TJX to
purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes.
We may redeem for cash all, or a portion of, the notes at any
time on or after February 13, 2007 for the original
purchase price plus accrued original issue discount.

The fair value of our general corporate debt, including current
installments, is estimated by obtaining market value quotes
given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is estimated
by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of general corporate
debt, including current installments, at January 29, 2005
is $327.9 million versus a carrying value of
$296.8 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes is $447.6 million versus a
carrying value of $375.8 million. These estimates do not
necessarily reflect certain provisions or restrictions in the
various debt agreements which might affect our ability to settle
these obligations.

During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million
five-year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2005 we
renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for
$330 million. Effective March 17, 2005, we extended
the 364-day agreement until July 15, 2005, with
substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original
facility remaining unchanged. We anticipate that during the year
we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size
of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity.
The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances
however, TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we
believe that non-compliance with these covenants is remote. The
revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial
paper program. As of January 29, 2005 there were no outstanding
amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our
U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was $5 million
during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004.
There were no short-term borrowings during fiscal 2003. The
weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings
was 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004.

F-14


As of January 29, 2005, TJX had credit lines totaling
C$20 million to meet certain operating needs of its
Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our
Canadian credit lines was C$6.8 million in fiscal 2005,
C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004, and C$19.2 million in
fiscal 2003.

D.     Financial Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Contracts:

In December 1999, prior to the
issuance of the $200 million ten-year notes, TJX entered into a
rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying treasury rate of
notes. The cost of this agreement has been deferred and is being
amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes and
results in an effective fixed rate of 7.60% on this debt. During
fiscal 2004, TJX entered interest rate swaps on
$100 million of the $200 million ten-year notes effectively
converting the interest on that portion of the unsecured notes
from fixed to a floating rate of interest indexed to the
six-month LIBOR rate. The maturity date of the interest rate
swaps coincides with the maturity date of the underlying debt.
Under these swaps, TJX pays a specified variable interest rate
and receives the fixed rate applicable to the underlying debt.
The interest income/expense on the swaps is accrued as earned
and recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on
the fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swaps are designated as
fair value hedges of the underlying debt. The fair value of the
contracts, excluding the net interest accrual, amounted to a
liability of $2.9 million and $3.1 million as of
January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
The valuation of the swaps results in an offsetting fair value
adjustment to the debt hedged; accordingly, long-term debt has
been reduced by $2.9 million in fiscal 2005 and was reduced
by $3.1 million in fiscal 2004. The average effective
interest rate, on the $100 million of the 7.45% unsecured
notes to which the swaps apply, was approximately 6.45% in
fiscal 2005 and approximately 5.30% in fiscal 2004.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain an economic hedge
on firm U.S. dollar and Euro merchandise purchase commitments
made by its foreign subsidiaries, T. K. Maxx (United Kingdom)
and Winners (Canada). These commitments are typically six months
or less in duration. The contracts outstanding at
January 29, 2005 cover certain commitments for the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. TJX elected not to apply hedge
accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the fair
value of these contracts resulted in income of $1.8 million
in fiscal 2005, income of $1.1 million in fiscal 2004 and
expense of $2.6 million in fiscal 2003.

TJX also enters into foreign currency forward and swap contracts
in both Canadian dollars and British pound sterling and accounts
for them as either a hedge of the net investment in and between
our foreign subsidiaries or as a cash flow hedge of certain
long-term intercompany debt. We apply hedge accounting to these
hedge contracts of our investment in foreign operations, and
changes in fair value of these contracts, as well as gains and
losses upon settlement, are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income, offsetting changes in the cumulative
foreign translation adjustments of our foreign divisions. The
change in fair value of the contracts designated as a hedge of
our investment in foreign operations resulted in a gain of
$3.8 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2005, a loss
of $24.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2004, and
a loss of $23.2 million in fiscal 2003. The change in the
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment resulted in a
loss of $10.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2005,
a gain of $14.3 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal
2004, and a gain of $23.0 million in fiscal 2003. Amounts
included in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow
hedges are reclassified to earnings as the currency exposure on
the underlying intercompany debt impacts earnings. The net loss
recognized in fiscal 2005 related to cash flow forward exchange
contracts and related underlying activity was
$13.9 million, net of income taxes, this amount was offset
by a gain of $11.9 million, net of income taxes, related to
the underlying exposure and both are included as components of
selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of
income. We estimate that $4.1 million of losses, net of
income taxes, deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
will be recognized in earnings over the next twelve months.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt, intercompany
interest payable and intercompany license fees. The changes in
fair value of these contracts are recorded in the statements of
income and are offset by marking the underlying item to fair
value in the same period. Upon settlement, the realized gains
and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains
and losses of the underlying item in the statement of income.
The net impact of hedging activity related to these intercompany
amounts resulted in losses of $317,000, $2.6 million and
$2.0 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

F-15


Effective January 31, 2004 the value of foreign currency
exchange contracts relating to inventory commitments is reported
in current earnings as a component of cost of sales, including
buying and occupancy costs. The income statement impact of all
other foreign currency contracts is reported as a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Following is a summary of TJX’s derivative financial
instruments and related fair values, outstanding at
January 29, 2005:

The fair value of the derivatives is classified as assets or
liabilities, current or non-current, based upon valuation
results and settlement dates of the individual contracts.
Following are the balance sheet classifications of the fair

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and swap contracts
require us to make payments of certain foreign currencies for
receipt of U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros. All of these
contracts except the contracts relating to our investment in our
foreign operations and long-term debt mature during fiscal 2006.
The British pound sterling investment hedges have maturities
from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2009, the Canadian dollar investment
hedge contracts and long-term debt hedge contracts have
maturities from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2010.

F-16


The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
agreements are major international financial institutions and
the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize our
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by one of
the counterparties. We do not require counterparties to maintain
collateral for these contracts. We periodically monitor our
position and the credit ratings of the counterparties and do not
anticipate losses resulting from the nonperformance of these
institutions.

E.     Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
fiscal 1996, had remaining terms ranging up to twenty-five
years. Leases for T.K. Maxx are generally for fifteen to
twenty-five years with ten-year kick-out options. Many of the
leases contain escalation clauses and early termination
penalties. In addition, we are generally required to pay
insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses
including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of
sales. These costs were of an amount equal to approximately
one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal years ended
January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
continuing operations as of January 29, 2005:

The capital lease commitment relates to a 283,000-square-foot
addition to TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments
commenced June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease
asset and related obligation equal to the present value of the
lease payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
amounted to $713.3 million, $597.8 million, and
$524.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
$6.9 million, $8.6 million, and $8.2 million in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; and sublease income
was $3.0 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004 and
$3.2 million in fiscal 2003. The total net present value of
TJX’s minimum operating lease obligations approximates
$3,833.4 million as of January 29, 2005, including a
current portion of $497.9 million.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$52.1 million as of January 29, 2005 and
$54.7 million as of January 31, 2004. Letters of
credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

F.     Stock Compensation Plans

In the following note, all references to historical awards,
outstanding awards and availability of shares for future grants
under TJX’s Stock Incentive Plan and related prices per
share have been restated, for comparability purposes, to reflect
the two-for-one stock split distributed in May 2002.

F-17


TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
stock awards may be granted to its directors, officers and key
employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
shareholders and all stock compensation awards are made under
this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
approval, provides for the issuance of up to 145.3 million
shares with 33.2 million shares available for future grants
as of January 29, 2005.

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, TJX has granted options for the
purchase of common stock, generally within ten years from the
grant date at option prices of 100% of market price on the grant
date. Most options outstanding vest over a three-year period
starting one year after the grant, and are exercisable in their
entirety three years after the grant date. Outstanding options
granted to directors become fully exercisable one year after the
date of grant.

TJX realizes an income tax benefit from restricted stock vesting
and the exercise of stock options, which results in a decrease
in current income taxes payable and an increase in additional
paid-in capital. Such benefits amounted to $20.9 million,
$13.6 million and $11.8 million for fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

TJX has also issued restricted stock and performance-based stock
awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. Restricted stock awards
are issued at no cost to the recipient of the award, and have
restrictions that generally lapse over three to four years from
date of grant. Performance-based shares have restrictions that
generally lapse over one to four years when and if specified
criteria are met. The market value in excess of cost is charged
to income ratably over the period during which these awards
vest. Such pre-tax charges amounted to $9.4 million,
$10.2 million and $3.2 million in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The market value of the awards is
determined at date of grant for restricted stock awards, and at
the date shares are earned for performance-based awards.

A combined total of 220,000 shares, 600,000 shares and 325,000
shares for restricted and performance-based awards were issued
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No shares were
forfeited during fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003. The weighted average
market value per share of these stock awards at grant date was
$22.37, $19.16 and $19.85 for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

F-18


TJX maintained a separate deferred stock compensation plan for
its outside directors under which deferred share awards valued
at $10,000 each were issued annually to outside directors.
During fiscal 2003, the Board merged this deferred stock
compensation plan into the Stock Incentive Plan, and all
deferred shares earned will be issued pursuant to the Stock
Incentive Plan. Beginning in June 2003, the annual deferred
share award granted to each outside director is valued at
$30,000. As of the end of fiscal 2005, a total of 68,536
deferred shares had been granted under the plan. Actual shares
will be issued at termination of service or a change of control.
Prior to merging the deferred stock award plan into the Stock
Incentive Plan, TJX planned to issue actual shares from shares
held in treasury.

G.     Capital Stock and Earnings
Per Share

Capital Stock

: TJX distributed a two-for-one stock split,
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, on May 8,
2002 to shareholders of record on April 25, 2002, which
resulted in the issuance of 269.4 million shares of common
stock and a corresponding decrease of $269.4 million in
retained earnings. All historical earnings per share amounts and
reference to common stock activity in the notes have been
restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

During fiscal 2003, we completed a $1 billion stock
repurchase program begun in fiscal 2001 and initiated another
multi-year $1 billion stock repurchase program. This
repurchase program was completed in May 2004. On May 24,
2004, we announced a new stock repurchase program, approved by
the Board of Directors, pursuant to which we may repurchase up
to an additional $1 billion of common stock. We had cash
expenditures under all of our repurchase programs of
$594.6 million, $520.7 million and $481.7 million
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, funded primarily by
cash generated from operations. The total common shares
repurchased amounted to 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005,
26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004 and 25.9 million
shares in fiscal 2003. As of January 29, 2005, we had
repurchased 17.7 million shares of our common stock at a
cost of $406.6 million under the current $1 billion
stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased have been
retired except 75,000 shares and 87,638 shares purchased in
fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are held in treasury.

TJX has authorization to issue up to 5 million shares of
preferred stock, par value $1. There was no preferred stock
issued or outstanding at January 29, 2005.

Earnings Per Share:

In October 2004, the Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) reached a consensus that EITF
Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share” would be
effective for reporting periods ending after December 15,
2004. This accounting pronouncement affects the company’s
treatment, for earnings per share purposes, of its
$517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes
issued in February 2001. The notes are convertible into
16.9 million shares of TJX common stock if the sale price
of our stock reaches certain levels or other contingencies are
met. Prior to this reporting period, the 16.9 million
shares were excluded from the diluted earnings per share
calculation because criteria for conversion had not been met.
EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that shares associated with
contingently convertible debt be included in diluted earnings
per share computations regardless of whether contingent
conversion conditions have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-08
also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior
periods be restated to reflect this change. As a result diluted
earnings per share for all periods presented reflect the assumed
conversion of our convertible subordinated notes.

F-19


The following schedule presents the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share:

The weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per
share calculation exclude the incremental effect related to
outstanding stock options, the exercise price of which is in
excess of the related fiscal year’s average price of
TJX’s common stock. Such options are excluded because they
would have an antidilutive effect. There were no such options
excluded as of January 29, 2005. As of January 31,
2004 and January 25, 2003, these options amounted to
22.7 million and 11.2 million, respectively.

H.     Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes the following:

F-20


TJX had net deferred tax (liabilities) as follows:

The fiscal 2005 total net deferred tax liability is presented on
the balance sheet as a current liability of $2.3 million
and a non-current liability of $152.6 million. For fiscal
2004, the net deferred tax liability is presented on the balance
sheet as a current asset of $9.0 million and a non-current
liability of $123.8 million. TJX has provided for deferred
U.S. taxes on all undistributed Canadian earnings. All earnings
of TJX’s other foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely
reinvested and no deferred taxes have been provided for on those
earnings. The net deferred tax liability relating to foreign
operations is included above and amounted to $31.0 million
and $16.0 million as of January 29, 2005 and
January 31, 2004, respectively.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) enacted on
October 22, 2004 will allow companies to repatriate the
undistributed earnings of its foreign operations in fiscal 2006
at an effective rate of 5.25%. The Company is evaluating the
impact of the act on TJX.

TJX has a United Kingdom operating loss carryforward of
approximately $2.4 million that may be applied against future
taxable income in the U.K., all of which has been recognized for
financial reporting purposes. The U.K. net operating loss does
not expire under current tax law.

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 38.5% for
fiscal 2005, 38.4% for fiscal 2004 and 38.3% for fiscal 2003.
The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax
rate and TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate is

The additional benefit reflected in “all other” in

for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the
termination of split-dollar arrangements described in Note I.

I. Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension

: TJX has a funded defined benefit retirement plan
covering the majority of its full-time U.S. employees. Employees
who have attained twenty-one years of age and have completed one
year of service are covered under the plan. No employee
contributions are required and benefits are based on
compensation earned in each year of service. We also have an
unfunded supplemental retirement plan which covers key employees
of the Company and provides additional retirement benefits based
on average compensation. Our funded defined benefit retirement
plan assets are invested primarily in stock and bonds of U.S.
corporations, excluding TJX, as well as various investment funds.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
funded defined benefit retirement plan (Funded Plan) and its
unfunded supplemental pension plan (Unfunded Plan) for the
fiscal years indicated. The valuation date for both plans is as
of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end date:

F-22


The net asset attributable to the funded plan is reflected on
the balance sheets as a non-current asset of $26.1 million
and a current asset of $32.9 million as of January 29, 2005
and a non-current asset of $32.3 million and a current
asset of $31.5 million as of January 31, 2004. The net
accrued liability attributable to TJX’s unfunded
supplemental retirement plan is included in other long-term
liabilities on the balance sheets.

We made aggregate cash contributions of $27.2 million,
$19.7 million and $59.9 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, to the non-contributory defined benefit
retirement plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments
under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. Our funding
policy is to fund any required contribution to the plan at the
full funding limitation. Contributions in excess of any required
contribution will be made so as to fully fund the accumulated
benefit obligation to the extent such contribution is allowed
for tax purposes. As a result of voluntary funding contributions
made in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we do not
anticipate any funding requirements for fiscal 2006. The
following is a summary of our target allocation for plan assets
along with the actual allocation of plan assets as of the
valuation date for the fiscal years presented:

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
equities and fixed income investments is used to maximize the
long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
plan liabilities, funded plan status, and corporate financial
condition. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend
of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity
investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as
well as small and large capitalizations. Both actively managed
and passively invested portfolios may be utilized for U.S.
equity investments. Other assets such as real estate funds,
private equity funds, and hedge funds are currently used for
their diversification and return enhancing characteristics.
Derivatives may be used to reduce market exposure, however,
derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the
market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly
investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and
periodic asset/liability studies.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term
rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied
and long-term historical relationships between equities and
fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted
capital market principle that assets with higher volatility
generate a greater return over the long term. Current market
factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated
before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
Proper consideration is also given to asset class
diversification and rebalancing as well as to the expected
returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan by each
category of plan assets. Peer data and historical returns are
reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

F-23


Following are the components of net periodic benefit cost for
our pension plans:

Net pension expense for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflects an
increase in service cost due to a reduction in the discount rate
and is impacted by the change in the amortization of actuarial
losses. Net periodic pension cost in all periods also reflects
increased service cost attributable to the change in assumption
regarding mortality effective at the beginning of fiscal 2002.

The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
projected benefit obligation are amortized over the average
remaining service life of participants. In addition, for the
unfunded plan, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that
exceed 30% of the projected benefit obligation are fully
recognized in net periodic pension cost.

Following is a schedule of the benefits expected to be paid in
each of the next five fiscal years, and in the aggregate for the
five fiscal years thereafter:

During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company entered into separate
arrangements with two executives whereby the Company agreed to
fund life insurance policies on a so-called split-dollar basis
in exchange for a waiver of all or a portion of the
executives’ retirement benefits under TJX’s
supplemental retirement plan. The arrangements were designed so
that the after-tax cash expenditures by TJX on the policies, net
of expected refunds of premiums paid, would be substantially
equivalent, on a present value basis, to the after-tax cash
expenditures that TJX would have incurred under its unfunded
supplemental retirement plan. During fiscal 2003, it was decided
to unwind the earlier transactions due to changes in the law.
During fiscal 2003, TJX’s obligations under the
split-dollar arrangements were canceled and TJX agreed to pay
the individuals additional amounts such that the net after-tax
cost to TJX, taking into account the unwind of those
arrangements, would be substantially equivalent on a present
value basis to the after-tax cost of TJX’s original
supplemental retirement plan obligations to the individuals. In
addition, TJX made a supplemental payment to one

F-24


of the individuals and agreed to indemnify the other individual
up to a specified limit for possible taxes associated with the
unwind transaction. Due to the differences in the income
statement reporting and income tax treatment of these two
different types of benefits, the income statement for fiscal
2003 includes a pre-tax charge of $2.1 million, offset by
tax benefits of $3.8 million for an increase in net income
of $1.7 million. The cumulative effect on net income
through fiscal 2003 of the initial transactions in fiscal 2001
and 2000, and of the related transactions in fiscal 2003, is
substantially the same as the after-tax cost of the retirement
benefit earned under the supplemental retirement plan. The
Company has a contingent obligation of $1.2 million in
connection with an indemnification clause relating to one
executive’s potential tax liability.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
eligible U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
assets under the plan totaled $504.7 million and
$421.8 million respectively, and are invested in a variety
of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay.
TJX matches employee contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at
rates ranging from 25% to 50% based upon the Company’s
performance. TJX contributed $8.1 million in fiscal 2005,
$7.3 million in fiscal 2004 and $7.1 million in fiscal 2003
to the 401(k) plan. Employees cannot invest their contributions
in the TJX stock fund option in the 401(k) plan, and may elect
to invest up to only 50% of the Company’s contribution in
the TJX stock fund; the TJX stock fund has no other trading
restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents 4.3%, 4.5% and 5.1%
of plan investments at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

During fiscal 1999, TJX established a nonqualified savings plan
for certain U.S. employees. TJX matches employee contributions
at various rates which amounted to $274,000 in fiscal 2005,
$226,000 in fiscal 2004, and $218,000 in fiscal 2003. TJX
transfers employee withholdings and the related company match to
a separate trust designated to fund the future obligations. The
trust assets, which are invested in a variety of mutual funds,
are included in other assets on the balance sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed to these plans
$2.7 million, $2.3 million and $1.9 million in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Postretirement Medical

: TJX has an unfunded
postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
in our retirement plan and who retire at age 55 or older with
ten or more years of service. The valuation date for the plan is
as of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end date.
Presented below is certain financial information relating to the
unfunded postretirement medical plan for the fiscal years
indicated:

F-25


For purposes of measuring TJX’s obligations under the
postretirement medical plan, a gross annual rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered health care benefits of 9% was
assumed in 2005 and is reduced by 1% each year to 5% in 2009 and
thereafter. However due to the plans’ $3,000 per capita
annual limit on medical benefits, the effect of the changes in
trend is limited. An increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate of one percentage point for all future years would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
January 29, 2005 by approximately $1.8 million and the
total of the service cost and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement cost for fiscal 2005 by approximately
$250,000. Similarly, decreasing the trend rate by one percentage
point for all future years would decrease the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at January 29, 2005 by
approximately $1.8 million as well as the total of the
service cost and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement cost for fiscal 2005 by approximately $250,000.

Following are components of net periodic benefit cost related to
our Postretirement Medical plan:

Following is a schedule of the benefits expected to be paid
under the unfunded postretirement medical plan in each of the
next five fiscal years, and in the aggregate for the five fiscal
years thereafter:

As of January 25, 2003, in addition to TJX’s
postretirement plan described above, we had a retirement
prescription drug benefit that was included in several
collective bargaining agreements. The prescription drug benefit
obligation as of January 25, 2003, amounted to
$8.1 million with a periodic benefit cost of
$1.5 million for fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004 the collective
bargaining agreements were amended which eliminated this
obligation.

unamortized landlord construction allowances, initially recorded

liabilities as a component of accrued rent and landlord

F-27


K.     Discontinued Operations
Reserve And Related Contingent Liabilities

We have a reserve for potential future obligations of
discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate
leases of former TJX businesses that have been sold or spun off.
The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation of its cost for
claims that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for
liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases when
the assignees of the leases filed for bankruptcy, after
mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations.

At January 29, 2005, substantially all leases of
discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies
and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had
been resolved. It is possible that there will be future costs
for leases from these discontinued operations that were not
terminated or have not expired. We do not expect to incur any
material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess
of our reserve. The reserve balance amounted to
$12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and
$17.5 million as of January 31, 2004.

During the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, we received
a $2.3 million creditor recovery in the House2Home
bankruptcy which we offset by a $2.3 million addition to our
reserve. We expect to receive some additional creditor recovery,
but the amount has not yet been determined.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of
BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

L.     Guarantees And Contingent
Obligations

We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a
lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed
above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
potential contingent obligations under them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note K and
properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet,
if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is
approximately $120 million as of January 29, 2005. We
believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will
not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved
for substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
respect to these contingent obligations.

M.     Supplemental Cash Flows
Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
discontinued operations as discussed in Note K, are classified
as a reduction in cash provided by continuing operations. There
are no remaining operating activities relating to these
operations.

Segment Information

The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed on a
combined basis and are reported as the Marmaxx segment. The
Winners and HomeSense chains are also managed on a combined
basis and operate exclusively in Canada. T.K. Maxx operates in
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Winners and T.K.
Maxx accounted for 17% of TJX’s net sales for fiscal 2005,
15% of segment profit and 20% of all consolidated assets. All of
our other store chains operate in the United States with the
exception of 14 stores operated in Puerto Rico by Marshalls
which include 5 HomeGoods locations in a “Marshalls Mega
Store” format. All of our stores, with the exception of
HomeGoods, HomeSense and Bob’s Stores sell apparel for the
entire family with a limited offering of giftware and home
fashions. The HomeGoods and HomeSense stores offer home fashions
and home furnishings. Bob’s Stores is a value-oriented
retailer of branded family apparel.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
“segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
income before general corporate expense and interest.
“Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be
considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
measure of liquidity.
