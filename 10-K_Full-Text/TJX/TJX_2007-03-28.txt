BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home
    fashions in the United States and worldwide. Our T.J. Maxx,
    Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the United States, our
    Winners chain in Canada, and our T.K. Maxx chain in Europe sell
    off-price family apparel and home fashions. Our HomeGoods chain
    in the United States and our HomeSense chain, operated by
    Winners in Canada, sell off-price home fashions. The target
    customer for all of our off-price chains, except A.J. Wright, is
    the middle-to upper-middle income shopper, with the same profile
    as a department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets
    the moderate-income customer. Our seven off-price chains are
    synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms. Our
    eighth chain, Bob’s Stores, was acquired in December 2003
    and is a value-oriented, branded apparel chain based in the
    Northeastern United States that offers casual, family apparel.
    Bob’s Stores’ target customer demographic spans the
    moderate-to upper-middle income bracket.

Our off-price mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and
    rapidly changing assortment of brand-name merchandise at
    excellent values to our customers. We define value as the
    combination of quality, brand, fashion and price. With over 450
    buyers and over 10,000 vendors worldwide and over 2,400 stores,
    we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this
    goal. Our key strengths include:

—

expertise in off-price buying

—

substantial buying power

—

synergistic businesses with flexible business models

—

solid relationships with many manufacturers and other
    merchandise suppliers

—

deep organization with decades of experience in off-price
    retailing as well as other forms of retailing

—

inventory management systems and distribution networks specific
    to our off-price business model

—

financial strength and excellent credit rating

As an off-price retailer, we offer quality, name brand and
    designer family apparel and home fashions every day at
    substantial savings to comparable department and specialty store
    regular prices. We can offer these everyday savings as a result
    of our opportunistic buying strategies, disciplined inventory
    management, including rapid inventory turns, and low expense
    structure.

In our off-price chains, we purchase the majority of our
    inventory opportunistically. In contrast to traditional
    retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they
    appear on the selling floor, TJX buyers are in the marketplace
    virtually every week, buying primarily for the current selling
    season. By maintaining a liquid inventory position, our buyers
    can buy close to need, enabling them to buy into current market
    trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the
    marketplace. Due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand
    in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace
    and the mismatch of supply and demand, we are regularly able to
    buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from
    manufacturers, with some merchandise coming from other retailers
    and other sources. We purchase virtually all of our inventory
    for our off-price stores at discounts from initial wholesale
    prices. Although we generally purchase merchandise for our
    off-price chains to sell in the current season, we purchase a
    limited quantity of pack away merchandise that we buy
    specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season.
    We are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles
    and sizes. We pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail
    concessions in our off-price chains such as advertising,
    promotional and markdown allowances, or delivery concessions
    such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return
    privileges. Our financial strength, strong reputation and
    ability to purchase large quantities of merchandise and sell it
    through our geographically diverse network of stores provide us
    excellent access to leading branded merchandise. Our
    opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our
    customers in our off-price chains a rapidly changing merchandise
    assortment at everyday values that are below department and
    specialty store regular prices.

We are extremely disciplined in our inventory management, and we
    rapidly turn the inventory in our off-price chains. We rely
    heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory systems
    and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of
    merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution
    infrastructure that supports our

close-to-need

buying by delivering goods to our stores quickly and
    efficiently. For example, highly automated storage and
    distribution systems track, allocate and deliver an average of
    approximately 11,000 items per week to each T.J. Maxx and
    Marshalls store. In addition, specialized computer inventory
    planning, purchasing and monitoring systems,


coupled with warehouse storage, processing, handling and
    shipping systems, permit a continuous evaluation and rapid
    replenishment of store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions
    and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined
    centrally, using information provided by

point-of-sale

computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through
    our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. These inventory
    management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid
    in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell
    substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to many other
    retailers. Our stores are generally located in community
    shopping centers. While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy
    shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience, we
    do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Our selling floor space
    is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free
    of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract
    departments in response to customer demand and available
    merchandise. Also, our large retail presence, strong financial
    position and expertise in the real estate market allow us
    generally to obtain favorable lease terms. In our off-price
    chains, our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains
    low compared to traditional department and specialty stores,
    although we increased our advertising and other marketing
    spending in fiscal 2007 as compared to prior years. Our high

sales-per-square-foot

productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense
    efficiencies.

With all of our off-price chains operating with the same
    off-price strategies and systems, we are able to capitalize upon
    expertise, best practices and new ideas across our chains,
    develop associates by transferring them from one chain to
    another, and grow our various businesses more efficiently and
    effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007, we derived
    78% of our sales from the United States (28% from the Northeast,
    14% from the Midwest, 23% from the South, and 13% from the
    West), 21% from foreign countries (10% from Canada, 11% from
    Europe (the United Kingdom and Ireland)), and 1% from Puerto
    Rico. By merchandise category, we derived approximately 63% of
    our sales from apparel (including footwear), 25% from home
    fashions and 12% from jewelry and accessories.

We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. The
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed as one
    division, referred to as Marmaxx, and are reported as a single
    segment. The Winners and HomeSense chains, which operate
    exclusively in Canada, are also managed as one division and are
    reported as a single segment. Each of our other store chains,
    T.K. Maxx, HomeGoods, A.J. Wright, and Bob’s Stores is
    operated as a division and reported as a separate segment. More
    detailed information about our segments, including financial
    information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be
    found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements.

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of
    January 27, 2007, and references to store square footage
    are to gross square feet. Fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year
    ended January 29, 2005, fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year
    ended January 28, 2006, fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year
    ended January 27, 2007 and fiscal 2008 means the fiscal
    year ending January 26, 2008.

SEGMENT OVERVIEW

Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx and Marshalls)

Marmaxx operates both the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains.
    T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retail chain in the United
    States, with 821 stores in 48 states at fiscal 2007 year
    end. Marshalls is the second-largest off-price retailer in the
    United States, with 734 stores in 42 states, as well as 14
    stores in Puerto Rico, at that date. We maintain the separate
    identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores through product
    assortment and merchandising, marketing and store appearance.
    This encourages our customers to shop at both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls primarily target female shoppers who
    have families with middle to upper-middle incomes and who
    generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store
    customer. These chains operate with a common buying and
    merchandising organization and have a consolidated
    administrative function, including finance and human resources.
    The combined organization, known internally as The Marmaxx
    Group, offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at
    favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost
    structure. These advantages are key to our ability to sell
    quality, brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from
    department and specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality, brand name and designer
    merchandise at prices generally 20%-60% below department and
    specialty store regular prices. Both chains offer family
    apparel, accessories, giftware, and home


fashions. Within these broad categories, T.J. Maxx offers a shoe
    assortment for women and fine jewelry, while Marshalls offers a
    full-line footwear department and a larger men’s
    department. In fiscal 2007, T.J. Maxx substantially completed
    the roll out of the expanded jewelry and accessories departments
    to existing stores and Marshalls continued to add expanded
    footwear departments. We believe these expanded offerings
    further differentiate the shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and
    Marshalls, driving traffic to both chains. We expect to add
    approximately 200 expanded footwear departments in the Marshalls
    stores in fiscal 2008, and at T.J. Maxx, we will continue to add
    expanded jewelry and accessories departments in new stores,
    relocated stores and selectively, to existing stores.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban
    community shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average
    approximately 30,000 square feet. Marshalls stores average
    approximately 32,000 square feet. We currently expect to add a
    net of 50 stores in fiscal 2008. Ultimately, we believe that
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately 1,800
    stores in the United States and Puerto Rico.

HomeGoods

HomeGoods is our off-price retail chain that sells exclusively
    home fashions with a broad array of giftware, home basics,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories, children’s
    furniture, and seasonal merchandise for the home. Many of the
    HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however, we also
    combine HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store in
    a superstore format, the majority of which are dual-branded,
    with both the T.J. Maxx or Marshalls logo and the HomeGoods
    logo. We count the superstores as both a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
    store and a HomeGoods store. In fiscal 2007, we continued to
    open a different superstore format, called a “combo
    store,” in which a HomeGoods store is located beside a T.J.
    Maxx or Marshalls store, with interior passageways providing
    access between the stores. This configuration is also
    dual-branded with both the T.J. Maxx or Marshalls logo and the
    HomeGoods logo.

Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average approximately 27,000 square
    feet. In superstores, which average approximately 53,000 square
    feet, we dedicate an average of 22,000 square feet to HomeGoods.
    The 270 stores open at the end of fiscal 2007 include 147
    stand-alone stores, 105 superstores and 18 combo stores. In
    fiscal 2008, we plan to net 12 additional stores, including
    1 superstore. We believe that the U.S. market could potentially
    support approximately 500 to 600 HomeGoods stores in the long
    term.

Winners and HomeSense

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering
    off-price brand name and designer women’s apparel,
    lingerie, accessories, home fashions, giftware, fine jewelry,
    menswear, children’s clothing, and family footwear. Winners
    operates HomeSense, our Canadian off-price home-fashions chain,
    launched in fiscal 2001. Like our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense
    offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of off-price home
    fashions including giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs,
    accessories and seasonal merchandise. We operate HomeSense in a
    stand-alone format, as well as a superstore format where a
    HomeSense store and a Winners store are combined or operate

side-by-side.

At fiscal 2007 year end, we operated 184 Winners stores,
    which averaged approximately 29,000 square feet and
    68 HomeSense stores, which averaged approximately 24,000
    square feet. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners stores and
    3 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2008, in both the stand-alone
    and superstore format. Ultimately, we believe the Canadian
    market can support approximately 200 Winners stores and
    approximately 80 HomeSense stores.

T.K. Maxx

T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, is the
    only major off-price retailer in any European country. T.K. Maxx
    utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by T.J. Maxx,
    Marshalls and Winners, and offers the same types of merchandise.
    At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 210 T.K. Maxx stores
    which averaged approximately 30,000 square feet. We expect to
    add a total of 10 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland in
    fiscal 2008 and believe that the U.K. and Ireland can support
    approximately 275 stores in the long term. In addition, in the
    fall of fiscal 2008, we expect to open 5 T.K. Maxx stores in
    Germany.

A.J. Wright

A.J. Wright offers our off-price concept to the moderate income
    customer demographic, which differentiates this chain from our
    other off-price divisions. A.J. Wright stores offer brand-name
    family apparel, accessories, footwear, domestics, gift ware,
    including toys and games, and special, opportunistic purchases.
    A.J. Wright stores average approximately 26,000 square feet. We
    operated 129 A.J. Wright stores in the United States at fiscal
    2007 year end.


During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we identified 34
    underperforming stores to close, as part of a plan to reposition
    A.J. Wright for future profitable growth. Virtually all of these
    stores were closed at the end of fiscal 2007. The cost to close
    these stores as well as the operating income or loss of these
    stores (in the current and prior periods) has been reported in
    our financial statements as a discontinued operation. In fiscal
    2008, we anticipate opening 5 stores in existing markets as we
    focus on improving performance, both in our existing store base
    and in opening new stores. In the long term, we believe that the
    U.S. could potentially support approximately 1,000 A.J. Wright
    stores.

Bob’s Stores

Bob’s Stores, acquired in late 2003, offers casual, family
    apparel and footwear, including workwear, activewear, and
    licensed team apparel. Bob’s Stores’ customer
    demographics span the moderate to upper-middle income bracket.
    Bob’s Stores operated 36 stores at the end of fiscal 2007,
    with an average size of 45,000 square feet. We do not plan to
    open any new stores for this division in fiscal 2008 as we
    continue to evaluate this business and focus on improving
    performance.

COMPUTER INTRUSION

We suffered an unauthorized intrusion into portions of our
    computer systems that process and store information related to
    customer transactions that we believe resulted in the theft of
    customer data. We do not know who took this action and whether
    there were one or more intruders involved (we refer to the
    intruder or intruders collectively as the “Intruder”),
    or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple,
    separate intrusions (we refer to the intrusion or intrusions
    collectively as the “Computer Intrusion”). We are
    engaged in an ongoing investigation of the Computer Intrusion,
    and the information provided in this

Form 10-K

is based on the information we have learned in our investigation
    to the date of this

Form 10-K.

We do not know what, if any, additional information we will
    learn in our investigation, but that information could
    materially add to or change the information provided in this

Form 10-K.

Discovery of Computer Intrusion.

On
    December 18, 2006, we learned of suspicious software on our
    computer systems. We immediately initiated an investigation, and
    the next day, General Dynamics Corporation and International
    Business Machines Corporation, leading computer security and
    incident response firms, were engaged to assist in the
    investigation. They determined on December 21, 2006 that
    there was strong reason to believe that our computer systems had
    been intruded upon and that an Intruder remained on our computer
    systems. With the assistance of our investigation team, we
    immediately began to design and implement a plan to monitor and
    contain the ongoing Computer Intrusion, protect customer data
    and strengthen the security of our computer systems against the
    ongoing Computer Intrusion and possible future attacks.

On December 22, 2006, we notified law enforcement officials
    of the suspected Computer Intrusion and later that day met with
    representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice,
    U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Attorney, Boston Office
    to brief them. At that meeting, the U.S. Secret Service
    advised us that disclosure of the suspected Computer Intrusion
    might impede their criminal investigation and requested that we
    maintain the confidentiality of the suspected Computer Intrusion
    until law enforcement determined that disclosure would no longer
    compromise the investigation.

With the assent of law enforcement, on December 26 and
    December 27, 2006, we notified our contracting banks and
    credit and debit card and check processing companies of the
    suspected Computer Intrusion (we refer to credit and debit cards
    as “payment cards”). On December 27, 2006, we
    first determined that customer information had apparently been
    stolen from our computer systems in the Computer Intrusion. On
    January 3, 2007, we, together with the U.S. Secret
    Service, met with our contracting banks and payment card and
    check processing companies to discuss the Computer Intrusion.

Prior to the public release of information with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion, we provided information on the Computer
    Intrusion to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
    U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Royal
    Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Federal Privacy
    Commissioner. Upon the public release, we also provided
    information to the Massachusetts and other state Attorneys
    General, California Office of Privacy Protection, various
    Canadian Provincial Privacy Commissioners, the U.K. Information
    Commissioner, and the Metropolitan Police in London, England.

On January 13, 2007, we determined that additional customer
    information had apparently been stolen from our computer systems.

On January 17, 2007, we publicly announced the Computer
    Intrusion and thereafter we expanded our forensic investigation
    of the Computer Intrusion.

On February 18, 2007, in the course of our ongoing
    investigation, we found evidence that the Computer Intrusion may
    have been initiated earlier than previously reported and that
    additional customer information potentially had been stolen. On
    February 21, 2007, we publicly announced additional
    findings on the timing and scope of the Computer Intrusion.

Timing of Computer Intrusion.

Based on our
    investigation to date, we believe that our computer systems were
    first accessed by an unauthorized Intruder in July 2005, on
    subsequent dates in 2005 and from mid-May 2006 to mid-January
    2007, but that no customer data were stolen after
    December 18, 2006.

Systems Affected in the Computer Intrusion.

We
    believe that information was stolen in the Computer Intrusion
    from a portion of our computer systems in Framingham, MA that
    processes and stores information related to payment card, check
    and unreceipted merchandise return transactions for customers of
    our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright stores in
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico and our Winners and HomeSense stores in
    Canada (“Framingham


system”) and from a portion of our computer systems in
    Watford, U.K. that processes and stores information related to
    payment card transactions at T.K. Maxx in the United Kingdom and
    Ireland (“Watford system”). We do not believe that the
    Computer Intrusion affected the portions of our computer systems
    handling transactions for customers of Bob’s Stores, or
    check and merchandise return transactions at T.K. Maxx. We do
    not believe that customer personal identification numbers (PINs)
    were compromised, because, before storage on the Framingham
    system, they are separately encrypted in U.S., Puerto Rican and
    Canadian stores at the PIN pad, and because we do not store PINs
    on the Watford system. We do not believe that information from
    transactions using debit cards issued by Canadian banks at
    Winners and HomeSense that were transacted through the Interac
    network was compromised. Although we believe that information
    from transactions at our U.S. stores (other than Bob’s
    Stores) using Canadian debit cards that were transacted through
    the NYCE network were processed and stored on the Framingham
    system, we do not believe the PINs required to use these
    Canadian debit cards were compromised in the Computer Intrusion.
    We do not process or store names or addresses on the Framingham
    system in connection with payment card or check transactions.

Customer Information Believed Stolen.

We have
    sought to identify customer information stolen in the Computer
    Intrusion. To date, we have been able to identify only some of
    the information that we believe was stolen. Prior to discovery
    of the Computer Intrusion, we deleted in the ordinary course of
    business the contents of many files that we now believe were
    stolen. In addition, the technology used by the Intruder has, to
    date, made it impossible for us to determine the contents of
    most of the files we believe were stolen in 2006. Given the
    scale and geographic scope of our business and computer systems
    and the time frames involved in the Computer Intrusion, our
    investigation has required a substantial period of time to date
    and is not completed. We are continuing to try to identify
    information stolen in the Computer Intrusion through our
    investigation, but, other than the information provided below,
    we believe that we may never be able to identify much of the
    information believed stolen.

Based on our investigation, we have been able to determine some
    details about information processed and stored on the Framingham
    system and the Watford system. Customer names and addresses were
    not included with the payment card data believed stolen for any
    period, because we do not process or store that information on
    the Framingham system or Watford system in connection with
    payment card transactions. In addition, for transactions after
    September 2, 2003, we generally no longer stored on our
    Framingham system the security data included in the magnetic
    stripe on payment cards required for card present transactions
    (“track 2” data), because those data generally were
    masked (meaning permanently deleted and replaced with
    asterisks). Also, by April 3, 2006, our Framingham system
    generally also masked payment card PINs, some other portions of
    payment card transaction information, and some portions of check
    transaction information. For transactions after April 7,
    2004 our Framingham system also generally began encrypting
    (meaning substituted characters for the actual characters using
    an encryption algorithm provided by our software vendor) all
    payment card and check transaction information. With respect to
    the Watford system, masking and encryption practices were
    generally implemented at various points in time for various
    portions of the payment card data.

Until discovery of the Computer Intrusion, we stored certain
    customer personal information on our Framingham system that we
    received in connection with returns of merchandise without
    receipts and in some check transactions in our U.S., Puerto
    Rican and Canadian stores (other than Bob’s Stores). In
    some cases, this personal information included drivers’
    license, military and state identification numbers (referred to
    as “personal ID numbers”), together with related names
    and addresses, and in some of those cases, we believe those
    personal ID numbers were the same as the customers’ social
    security numbers. After April 7, 2004, we generally
    encrypted this personal information when stored on our
    Framingham system. We do not process or store information
    relating to check or merchandise return transactions or customer
    personal information on the Watford system.

Information Believed Stolen in 2005.

As we
    previously publicly reported, we believe customer data were
    stolen in September and November 2005 relating to a portion of
    the payment card transactions made at our stores in the U.S.,
    Puerto Rico and Canada (excluding transactions at Bob’s
    Stores and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense through
    the Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian banks)
    during the period from December 31, 2002 through
    June 28, 2004. We suspect the data believed stolen in 2005
    related to somewhere between approximately half to substantially
    all of the transactions at U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian
    stores during the period from December 31, 2002 through
    June 28, 2004 (excluding transactions at Bob’s Stores
    and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense through the
    Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian banks). The
    data were included in files routinely created on our Framingham
    system to store customer data, but the contents of many of the
    files were deleted in the ordinary course of business prior to
    discovery of the Computer Intrusion. Through our investigation
    to date, we have


identified the information set forth in the following chart with
    respect to the approximate number of payment cards for which
    information is believed to have been stolen in this period:

Substantially all stolen data from
    these periods were deleted in the ordinary course of business
    subsequent to the believed theft but prior to discovery of
    Computer Intrusion. We have not sought to decrypt encrypted data
    that was not deleted.

Customer names and addresses and, for transactions after
    September 2, 2003, track 2 data were not included in the
    payment card information believed stolen in 2005. We do not
    believe that customer PINs were compromised.

In addition, we believe that personal information provided in
    connection with a portion of the unreceipted merchandise return
    transactions at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods stores in
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico, primarily during the last four months
    of 2003 and May and June 2004, was also stolen in 2005. The
    information we are able to specifically identify was from 2003
    and included personal ID numbers, together with the related
    names

and/or

addresses, of approximately 451,000 individuals. We are in the
    process of notifying these individuals directly by letter.

Information Believed Stolen in 2006.

As
    previously publicly reported, we identified a limited number of
    payment cards as to which transaction information was included
    in the customer data that we believe were stolen in 2006. This
    information was contained in two files apparently created in
    connection with computer systems problems in 2004 and 2006.
    Through our investigation to date, we have identified the
    following information with respect to the approximate number of
    payment cards for which unencrypted information was included in
    these files:

Customer names and addresses were not included with the payment
    card information in these files. We do not believe that customer
    PINs were compromised. Some of the payment card data contained
    in these files were encrypted; we have not sought to decrypt
    these data.

In addition, the two files contained the personal ID numbers,
    together with the related names

and/or

addresses, of approximately 3,600 individuals, and we sent
    notice directly to these individuals.

We also have located a third file created in the ordinary course
    that we believe was stolen by the Intruder in 2006 and that we
    believe contained customer data. All of the data in this file
    are encrypted, and we have not sought to decrypt them.

As previously publicly reported, we believe that in 2006 the
    Intruder may also have stolen from our Framingham system
    additional payment card, check and unreceipted merchandise
    return information for transactions made in our stores in the
    U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico (excluding transactions at
    Bob’s Stores and transactions made at Winners and HomeSense
    through the Interac network with debit cards issued by Canadian
    banks) during portions of mid-May through December 18,
    2006. Through our investigation, we have identified
    approximately 100 files that we believe the Intruder, during
    this period, stole from our Framingham system (the vast majority
    of which we believe the Intruder created) and that we suspect
    included customer data. However, due to the technology utilized
    by the Intruder, we are unable to determine the nature or extent
    of information included in these files. Despite our masking and
    encryption practices on our Framingham system in 2006, the
    technology utilized in the Computer Intrusion during 2006 could
    have enabled the Intruder to steal payment card data from our
    Framingham system during the payment card issuer’s approval
    process, in which data (including the track 2 data) is
    transmitted to payment card issuer’s without encryption.
    Further, we believe that the Intruder had access to the
    decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by TJX. The


approximately 100 files stolen in 2006 could have included the
    data that we believe were stolen in 2005, as well as other data
    relative to some customer transactions from December 31,
    2002 through mid-May 2006, although, with respect to
    transactions after September 2, 2003 generally without
    track 2 data, and, with respect to transactions after
    April 7, 2004, generally with all data encrypted.

In addition, as previously publicly reported, we suspect that
    customer data for payment card transactions at T.K. Maxx stores
    in the U.K. and Ireland has been stolen. In that regard, we now
    believe that at least two files of the approximately 100 files
    identified above that the Intruder stole from the Framingham
    system in 2006 were created by the Intruder and moved from the
    Watford system to the Framingham system. We suspect that these
    files contained payment card transaction data, some or all of
    which could have been unencrypted and unmasked. However, due to
    the technology utilized by the Intruder in the Computer
    Intrusion, we are unable to determine the nature or extent of
    information included in these files. Further, the technology
    utilized by the Intruder in the Computer Intrusion during 2006
    on the Watford system could also have enabled the Intruder to
    steal payment card data from the Watford system during the
    payment card issuer’s approval process, in which data
    (including the track 2 data) are transmitted to payment card
    issuer’s without encryption.

We have provided extensive payment card transaction information
    to the banks and payment card companies with which we contract
    as requested by them. While we have been advised by law
    enforcement authorities that they are investigating fraudulent
    use of payment card information believed stolen from TJX, we do
    not know the extent of any fraudulent use of such information.
    Some banks and payment card companies have advised us that they
    have found what they consider to be preliminary evidence of
    possible fraudulent use of payment card information that may
    have been stolen from us, but they have not shared with us the
    details of their preliminary findings. We also do not know the
    extent of any fraudulent use of any of the personal information
    believed stolen. Certain banks have sought, and other banks and
    payment card companies may seek, either directly against us or
    through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may
    have an indemnity obligation, payment of or reimbursement for
    fraudulent card charges and operating expenses (such as costs of
    replacing

and/or

monitoring payment cards thought by them to have been placed at
    risk by the Computer Intrusion) that they believe they have
    incurred by reason of the Computer Intrusion. In addition,
    payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines
    by reason of the Computer Intrusion.

Financial Costs.

In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately
    $5 million, or $.01 per share, for costs incurred
    through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer
    Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate and
    contain the Computer Intrusion, strengthen computer security and
    systems, and communicate with customers, as well as technical,
    legal, and other fees. Beyond this charge, we do not have enough
    information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising
    from the Computer Intrusion. Various litigation has been or may
    be filed, and various claims have been or may be otherwise
    asserted, against us

and/or

our
    acquiring banks, on behalf of customers, banks,

and/or

card
    companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the Computer
    Intrusion and other related relief. We intend to defend such
    litigation and claims vigorously, although we cannot predict the
    outcome of such litigation and claims. Various governmental
    entities are investigating the Computer Intrusion, and although
    we are cooperating in such investigations, we may be subject to
    fines or other obligations. (See Item 3 with respect to
    litigation and investigations.) Losses that we may incur as a
    result of the Computer Intrusion include losses arising out of
    claims by payment card associations and banks, customers,
    shareholders, governmental entities and others; technical,
    legal, computer systems and other expenses; and other potential
    liabilities, costs and expenses. Such losses could be material
    to our results of operation and financial condition.

Future Actions.

We are continuing our forensic
    investigation of the Computer Intrusion and our ongoing program
    to strengthen and protect our computer systems. We are
    continuing to communicate with our customers about the Computer
    Intrusion. We are continuing to cooperate with law enforcement
    in its investigation of these crimes and with the payment card
    companies and associations and our acquiring banks. We are also
    continuing to cooperate with governmental agencies in their
    investigations of the Computer Intrusion. We are vigorously
    defending the litigation and claims asserted against us with
    respect to the Computer Intrusion.

OTHER
    INFORMATION

Employees

At January 27, 2007, we had approximately 125,000
    employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per week. In
    addition, we hire temporary employees during the peak

back-to-school

and holiday seasons.


Credit

Our stores operate primarily on a

cash-and-carry

basis. Each chain accepts credit sales through programs offered
    by banks and others. We do not operate our own customer credit
    card program or maintain customer credit receivables. Our
    co-branded TJX card program for our domestic divisions offered
    by a major bank expired February 1, 2007, as scheduled. We
    plan to offer a new co-branded TJX credit card program with a
    different major bank in fiscal 2008. The rewards program
    associated with these programs is partially funded by TJX.

Buying and Distribution

We operate a centralized buying organization that services both
    the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, while each of our other
    chains has its own centralized buying organization. All of our
    chains are serviced through their own distribution networks
    which includes the use of third party providers at our HomeGoods
    division.

Trademarks

Our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx,
    Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, A.J. Wright
    and Bob’s Stores, are registered in relevant countries. Our
    rights in these trademarks and service marks endure for as long
    as they are used.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal influences, which causes us
    generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the
    second half of the year. This is common in the apparel retail
    business.

Competition

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
    value, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
    recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. We compete
    with local, regional, national and international department,
    specialty, off-price, discount and outlet stores as well as
    other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other
    merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through catalogues
    or media or over the internet. We purchase most of our inventory
    opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other
    off-price apparel and outlet retailers. We also compete with
    other retailers for store locations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

The statements in this Section describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully, in connection with
    all of the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary
    statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995.

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2006

Form 10-K

and in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders contain some
    forward-looking statements, including some of the statements
    made under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
    our 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders under “Letter to
    Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.” From time
    to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other
    materials we release to the public as well as oral
    forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current
    expectations or forecasts of future events;


they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We
    have generally identified such statements by using words such as
    “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe,” “will,”
    “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions
    in connection with any discussion of future operating or
    financial performance. All statements that address activities,
    events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may
    occur in the future are forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
    particular, these include statements relating to future actions,
    future performance or results of current and anticipated sales,
    expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of
    contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
    realized. Achievement of future results is subject to risks,
    uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should
    known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
    underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could
    differ materially from past results and those anticipated,
    estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you
    consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking
    statements, whether as a result of new information, future
    events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any
    further disclosures we make on related subjects in our

Form 10-Q

and

8-K

reports to the SEC. The risks that follow, individually or in
    the aggregate, are those that we think could cause our actual
    results to differ materially from those stated or implied in
    forward-looking statements. You should understand that it is not
    possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently,
    you should not consider the following to be a complete
    discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Our
    revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not continue
    to expand our operations successfully.

We have steadily expanded the number of chains and stores we
    operate and our selling square footage. Our revenue growth is
    dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully
    through new store openings as well as our ability to increase
    same store sales. Successful store growth requires selection of
    store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
    attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
    negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable sites
    and increases in real estate, construction and development costs
    could limit our growth opportunities. Even if we succeed in
    opening new stores, these new stores may not achieve the same
    sales or profit levels as our existing stores. Further,
    expansion places demands upon us to manage rapid growth, and we
    may not do so successfully.

Our
    quarterly operating results can be subject to significant
    fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or
    investors’ expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in
    the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the
    future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar
    to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short
    of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations.
    Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include
    some factors that are within our control such as the execution
    of our off-price buying; selection, pricing, flow and mix of
    merchandise; and inventory management including markon and
    markdowns; and some factors that are not within our control
    including actions of competitors; weather conditions; economic
    conditions and consumer confidence; and seasonality. In
    addition, if we do not repurchase, or are unable to repurchase,
    the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock
    repurchase program, our earnings per share may be adversely
    affected. Most of our operating expenses, such as rent expense
    and associate salaries, do not vary directly with the amount of
    sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a
    result, if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations
    for that quarter, we may not proportionately reduce operating
    expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales shortfall
    would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the
    quarter. We maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project
    sales and align expenses. If management fails to correctly
    forecast changes or appropriately adjust the business plan in
    light of results, our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

We may
    have difficulty extending our off-price model in new product
    lines, chains and geographic regions.

We have expanded our original off-price model into different
    product lines, chains, geographic areas and countries. Our
    growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our
    off-price retail apparel and home fashions concepts in new
    markets and geographic regions. If we are unable to successfully
    execute our concepts in these


new markets and regions, or if consumers there are not receptive
    to the concepts, our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

If we
    fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory
    management well, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with
    our buyers purchasing close to need. To drive traffic to the
    stores and to increase same store sales, the treasure hunt
    nature of the off-price buying experience requires continued
    replenishment of fresh high quality, attractively priced
    merchandise. While opportunistic buying enables our buyers to
    buy at the right time and price, in the quantities we need and
    into market trends, it places considerable discretion in our
    buyers, subjecting us to risks on the timing, quantity and
    nature of inventory flowing to the stores. We rely on our
    expansive distribution infrastructure to support delivering
    goods to our stores on time. We must effectively and timely
    distribute inventory to stores, maintain an appropriate mix and
    level of inventory and effectively manage pricing and markdowns.
    Failure to acquire and manage our inventory well and to operate
    our distribution infrastructure effectively could adversely
    affect our performance and our relationship with our customers.

Our
    success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional
    efforts. If we are unable to implement them successfully, or if
    our competitors are more effective than we are, our revenue may
    be adversely affected.

We use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers
    to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We
    use various media for our promotional efforts, including print,
    television, database marketing and direct marketing. If we fail
    to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to
    implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our
    competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and
    cause them to decrease purchases in our stores and increase
    purchases elsewhere, which might negatively impact our revenues.
    Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or
    merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have
    difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new
    customers.

We have
    expended and expect to expend significant time and money as a
    result of the Computer Intrusion we suffered, and as a result of
    the Computer Intrusion, we could incur material losses, and our
    reputation and business could be materially harmed.

We suffered the Computer Intrusion in which we believe that
    customer data were stolen. We are conducting an investigation of
    the Computer Intrusion. To date, we have been able to identify
    only some of the information that we believe was stolen.
    Deletions in the ordinary course of business prior to discovery
    of the Computer Intrusion and the technology used by the
    Intruder have, to date, made it impossible for us to determine
    much of the information we believe was stolen, and we believe
    that we may never be able to identify much of that information.
    Further, we cannot predict whether we will learn information in
    addition to or different from the information that we now
    believe about the Computer Intrusion and the data believed
    stolen.

While we have been advised by law enforcement authorities that
    they are investigating fraudulent use of payment card
    information believed stolen from TJX, we do not know the extent
    of any fraudulent use of such information. Some banks and
    payment card companies have advised us that they have found what
    they consider to be preliminary evidence of possible fraudulent
    use of credit payment card information that may have been stolen
    from us, but they have not shared with us the details of their
    preliminary findings. We also do not know the extent of any
    fraudulent use of any of the personal information believed
    stolen. There could be significant fraudulent use of the
    information believed stolen from us.

We have incurred capital and other costs to investigate and
    contain the Computer Intrusion, strengthen our computer security
    and systems, and communicate with customers, as well as legal,
    technical and other fees, and we expect to continue to incur
    significant costs for these purposes. Certain banks have sought,
    and other banks and payment card companies may seek, either
    directly against us or through claims against our acquiring
    banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation, payment
    of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating
    expenses (such as costs of replacing

and/or

monitoring payment cards thought by them to have been placed at
    risk by the Computer Intrusion) that they believe they have
    incurred by reason of the Computer Intrusion. In addition,
    payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines
    by reason of the Computer Intrusion.

Various litigation has been or may be filed, and various claims
    have been or may be otherwise asserted, against us

and/or

our
    acquiring banks for which we may be responsible, on behalf of
    customers, banks, payment card companies


and shareholders seeking damages allegedly arising out of the
    Computer Intrusion and other related relief. We intend to defend
    such litigation and claims vigorously, although we cannot
    predict the outcome of such litigation and claims. Various
    governmental entities are investigating the Computer Intrusion,
    and although we are cooperating in such investigations, we may
    be subject to fines or other obligations. We cannot predict what
    actions such governmental entities will take and what the
    consequences will be for us. The ultimate resolution of such
    litigation, claims and investigations could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition. Regardless of the merits and ultimate outcome of
    these matters, litigation and proceedings of this type are
    expensive to respond to and defend, and we could devote
    substantial resources and time to responding to and defending
    them.

Beyond the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007,
    we do not have enough information to reasonably estimate losses
    we may incur arising from the Computer Intrusion. These losses
    may include losses arising out of claims by payment card
    companies and banks, customers, shareholders and governmental
    entities; technical, legal, computer system and other expenses;
    and other potential liabilities, costs and expenses. Such losses
    could be material to our results of operations and financial
    condition. Further, the publicity associated with the Computer
    Intrusion could materially harm our business and relationships
    with customers.

Since discovering the Computer Intrusion, we have taken steps
    designed to strengthen the security of our computer systems and
    protocols and have instituted an ongoing program to continue to
    do so. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will not
    suffer a future data compromise. We rely on commercially
    available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide
    security for processing, transmission and storage of
    confidential customer information, such as payment card and
    personal information. We believe that the Intruder had access to
    the decryption algorithm for the encryption software we utilize.
    Further, the systems currently used for transmission and
    approval of payment card transactions, and the technology
    utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put
    payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the
    payment card industry, not by us. Improper activities by third
    parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and
    encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other
    events or developments may facilitate or result in a further
    compromise or breach of our computer systems. Any such further
    compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our
    operations, damage to our reputation and customers’
    willingness to shop in our stores and subject us to additional
    costs and liabilities.

Our
    business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in
    sales or margins during the second half of the year could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences; we realize
    higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the
    year. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could
    have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

If we
    fail to anticipate consumer trends and preferences, our
    performance could suffer.

Because our success depends on our ability to keep up with
    consumer trends, we take steps to address the risk that we will
    fail to anticipate consumer preferences. These include, for
    example, maintaining extensive contacts with vendors, with other
    retailers, as appropriate, and with the National Retail
    Federation, comparison shopping and monitoring fashion trends.
    Our buying departments and individual buyers monitor consumer
    trends and preferences in their respective product categories
    and areas. We focus on the demographics associated with the
    customer bases of our divisions and we monitor such demographics
    in locating new and remodeled stores. Nonetheless, we still face
    the risk that we will fail to effectively anticipate consumer
    trends and preferences, which failure could adversely affect our
    operating results.

We
    experience risks associated with our substantial size and
    scale.

We operate eight store chains in several countries. Some aspects
    of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted
    with relative autonomy. The large size of our operations, our
    multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the chains
    increase the risk that systems and practices will not be
    implemented uniformly throughout our Company and that
    information will not be appropriately shared across different
    chains and countries.

Unseasonable
    weather in the markets in which our stores operate could
    adversely affect our operating results.

Customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the
    merchandise in our stores are affected by adverse and
    unseasonable weather. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or
    rain storms, natural disasters, severe cold or heat or


extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets
    could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns.

We
    operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to
    compete effectively.

The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for
    customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and
    other important aspects of our business with many other local,
    regional and national retailers. We also face competition from
    alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogues,
    media and internet sites. Changes in the merchandising, pricing
    and promotional activities of those competitors and in the
    retail industry generally may adversely affect our performance.

If we do
    not attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and
    other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying
    and management personnel, our performance could be adversely
    affected.

Our performance is dependent on recruiting, developing, training
    and retaining quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and
    management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level
    or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover.
    The nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us
    to the risk of immigration law violations. Our ability to meet
    our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external
    factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates,
    minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In the event
    of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages
    competitively, our customer service could suffer because of a
    declining quality of our workforce, or our earnings could
    decrease if we increase our wage rates. In addition, certain
    associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
    therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Further, our
    off-price model limits the market for experienced buying and
    management personnel and requires us to do significant internal
    training and development. Changes that adversely impact our
    ability to attract and retain quality associates and management
    personnel could adversely affect our performance.

If we
    engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or divest
    any of our current businesses, our business will be subject to
    additional risks.

We have grown our business through mergers and acquisitions.
    Integrating new stores and concepts can be a difficult task. We
    may consider attractive opportunities to acquire new businesses
    or to divest any of our current business segments. Acquisition
    or divestiture activities may divert attention of our executive
    management team away from the existing businesses. We may do a
    less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target
    companies. Divestiture also involves risks, such as the risk of
    future exposure on lease obligations. Failure to execute on
    mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could have an
    adverse effect on our future business prospects or our financial
    performance in the future.

If we are
    unable to operate information systems and implement new
    technologies effectively, our business could be disrupted or our
    sales or profitability could be reduced.

The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our
    information systems, including our ability to operate them
    effectively and to successfully implement new technologies,
    systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. In
    addition, we must protect the confidentiality of our and our
    customers’ data. The failure of TJX’s information
    systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and
    operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject
    us to liability and thereby harm our profitability. See also the
    risk factor above entitled “

We have expended and expect
    to expend significant time and money as a result of the Computer
    Intrusion we suffered, and as a result of the Computer
    Intrusion, we could incur material losses, and our reputation
    and business could be materially harmed.

”

We depend
    upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new
    capital expansion, operations, debt repayment and stock
    repurchase program.

Our business is dependent upon our operations generating strong
    cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements, our
    general operating activities and our stock repurchase programs
    and to fund debt repayment and the availability of financing
    sources. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash
    flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of
    financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could
    adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per
    share growth.


Consumer
    spending is adversely affected by general economic and other
    factors, which are beyond our control, and could adversely
    affect our sales and operating results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
    availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
    policy; unemployment trends; threats or possibilities of war,
    terrorism or other global or national unrest; actual or
    threatened epidemics; political or financial instability; and
    general economic and other factors have significant effects on
    consumer confidence and spending, which in turn affect sales at
    TJX and other retailers. These factors are beyond our control
    and could adversely affect our sales and performance.

We are
    subject to import risks.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
    vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries.
    Imported merchandise is subject to various risks, including
    potential disruptions in supply, changes in duties, tariffs,
    quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported
    merchandise, strikes and other events affecting delivery; and
    economic, political or other problems in countries from or
    through which merchandise is imported. Political or financial
    instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange
    rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating
    to international trade and imported merchandise are beyond our
    control and could affect the availability and the price of our
    inventory.

Our
    expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent
    in foreign operations.

We have a significant presence in Canada, the United Kingdom and
    Ireland, and have plans to expand into Germany in fiscal 2008.
    We may also seek to expand into other international markets in
    the future. Our foreign operations encounter risks similar to
    those faced by our U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in
    foreign operations, such as understanding the retail climate and
    trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign
    markets, complying with foreign laws, rules and regulations, and
    foreign currency fluctuations, which could have an adverse
    impact on our profitability.

Changes
    in laws and regulations and accounting rules and principles
    could negatively affect our business operations and financial
    performance.

Various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state
    or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change
    from time to time. Generally accepted accounting principles may
    change from time to time, as well. Regulatory developments and
    changes in accounting rules and principles could adversely
    affect our business operations and financial performance.

We
    maintain internal controls over financial reporting, but they
    cannot provide absolute assurance that there will not be
    material errors in our financial reporting.

We maintain a system of internal controls over financial
    reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal
    control systems. If we are unable to maintain adequate and
    effective internal control over financial reporting, our
    financial performance could be adversely affected. A control
    system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
    and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to
    their costs.

Litigation.

Since mid-January, 2007, a number
    of putative class actions have been filed against TJX in state
    and federal courts in Alabama, California, Massachusetts and
    Puerto Rico, and in provincial Canadian courts in Alberta,
    British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan,
    putatively on behalf of customers, including all customers in
    the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, whose transaction
    data were allegedly compromised by the Computer Intrusion. An
    action has also been filed against TJX in federal court in
    Massachusetts putatively on behalf of all financial institutions
    who issued credit and debit cards purportedly used at TJX stores
    during the period of the security breach. The actions assert
    claims, generally, for negligence and related common-law and/or
    statutory causes of action stemming from the Computer Intrusion,
    and seek various forms of relief including damages, related
    injunctive or equitable remedies, multiple or punitive damages,
    and attorney’s fees. Various wholly-owned subsidiaries of
    TJX, as well as Fifth Third Bank and/or Fifth Third Bancorp, are
    also named as defendants in several of the actions. These cases
    are all in their initial phases, and no discovery has commenced.
    On February 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in one of the cases
    filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
    Litigation, MDL Docket No. 1838, to have all of the actions
    pending in federal court in the United States and Puerto Rico
    transferred to the District of Massachusetts for pretrial
    consolidation and coordination, and TJX has supported that
    motion. TJX intends to defend these actions vigorously. The
    actions referenced above are as follows:

On January 19, 2007, a putative class action was filed
    against TJX in the United States District Court for the District
    of Alabama,

Wood, et ano. v. TJX, Inc., et al.

,
    07-cv-00147. The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of
    “all TJX customers who made credit card transactions at
    TJX’s stores during the period that the security of
    [d]efendants computer systems were compromised and the privacy
    or security of whose credit card, check card, or debit card
    account, transaction or non-public information was
    compromised.” The complaint asserts claims for negligence
    per se, negligence, bailment and breach of contract, and also
    names Fifth Third Bancorp as a defendant. Plaintiffs seek
    compensatory damages, credit monitoring, injunctive relief,
    attorney’s fees and costs. On March 6, 2007, the court
    granted an unopposed motion to stay the action pending
    disposition of the motion before the Judicial Panel for
    Multidistrict Litigation to transfer the action and similar
    federal court actions to the District of Massachusetts for
    pretrial consolidation and coordination.

On January 19, 2007, a putative class action was filed

    Canada and elsewhere, who have communicated confidential debit
    and credit information to the Defendants in 2003 or between
    May 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.” The complaint
    also names “Winners Apparel Inc.” and “HomeSense
    Inc.” as defendants and asserts claims for negligence,
    breach of confidence and violation of privacy. The plaintiff
    seeks general and pecuniary damages, punitive damages, interest,
    attorney’s fees and costs.

On January 26, 2007, a putative class action was filed
    against TJX in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County,
    California,

Lemley v. TJX, Inc., et al.

, BC365384. The
    action was subsequently removed to the United States District
    Court for the District of California (docket

no. 07-cv-01017),

where plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On March 15,
    2007, the Court issued an order remanding the action back to the
    Superior Court, and TJX is seeking further review of that order.
    The plaintiff in the action purports to represent a class of
    “all TJX customers who made credit card transactions at
    TJX’s stores during the period that the security of
    [d]efendants’ computer systems were compromised and the
    privacy or security of whose credit card, check card, or debit
    card account, transaction or non-public information was
    compromised.” The complaint, as amended, asserts claims for
    negligence per se, negligence, bailment, breach of contract, and
    violation of California Civil Code § 17200, California
    Civil Code § 1798.80-84, and California Civil Code §
    1798.53. The action also includes Bob’s Stores Corp. and
    Fifth Third Bancorp as defendants. The plaintiff seeks

    profits and appointment of a receiver, attorney’s fees,
    costs and interest.

No. 07-01-50449.

The plaintiffs purport to represent a putative class of
    “[a]ll persons (including their estates, executors, or

    negligence, breach of contract and bailment, and TJX has
    received a related demand letter purporting to assert a further
    claim on behalf of individuals in the United States and Canada
    under Massachusetts General Laws, c. 93A. Plaintiffs seek
    compensatory damages, creation of a fund for future damages,
    credit monitoring, injunctive relief, attorney’s fees and
    costs.

    T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, or A.J. Wright stores in the United States
    in 2003 or from May to December 2006.” The complaint
    asserts claims for negligence and violation of Massachusetts

    al.

, BC367531, and

Pickering v. The TJX Companies, Inc.,
    et al.

, BC367530. The plaintiffs in each case purport to
    represent a class of ‘[a]ll California residents whose
    debit cards, check cards, credit cards (including American
    Express, Discover, MasterCard or Visa accounts), transaction or
    other personal or non-public information, including information
    at any TJX retail store such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, was
    maintained, provided to others and/or subject to unauthorized
    release by Defendants from January 2003 through the date of
    [j]udgment.” The complaints in each case assert claims for

    District of California,

Tennent v. The TJX Companies, Inc.,
    et ano.

, 07-cv-00484. The plaintiff purports to represent a

    per se, negligence, and bailment, and also names Fifth Third
    Bancorp as a defendant. The plaintiff seeks compensatory
    damages, credit monitoring, injunctive relief, attorneys fees
    and costs.

On March 23, 2007, a putative class action was filed in the
    United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,

Rivas, et ano. v. TJX Companies, Inc.

, 07-cv-10565. The
    plaintiffs purport to represent a class of “all individuals
    in the United States whose personal or financial data was
    stolen, or cannot definitively be determined not to have been
    stolen, from TJX as a result of the conduct” alleged in the
    complaint. The complaint asserts claims for negligence, breach
    of contract, bailment and for violation of Massachusetts General
    Laws c. 93A, § 2. The plaintiffs seek


compensatory damages, treble damages with respect to the
    statutory violation claim, injunctive relief, a fund to
    compensate future damages, attorney’s fees, interest and
    costs.

In addition, the Arkansas Carpenters Pension Fund (the
    “Pension Fund”), the purported beneficial holder of
    4,500 shares of TJX common stock, has commenced an action
    in the Delaware Chancery Court under Section 220 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law demanding to inspect certain of
    TJX’s books and records relating to the Computer Intrusion
    and TJX’s response to the Computer Intrusion. As relief,
    the Pension Fund seeks the right to inspect records dating back
    to 2003, as well as its attorneys’ fees and costs.

Government Investigations.

A number of
    government agencies are conducting investigations as to whether
    TJX as a result of the Computer Intrusion may have violated laws
    regarding consumer protection and related matters. TJX has been
    advised that the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts is leading an investigation into the Computer
    Intrusion on behalf of a multi-state group of state Attorneys
    General (the “Multi-State Group”), which as initially
    comprised had approximately 30 participating states. In March
    2007, the Company received a civil investigative demand
    (“CID”) from the Massachusetts Attorney General’s
    office seeking documents concerning the Computer Intrusion as
    part of that office’s review of allegations that the
    Company may have violated state law regarding consumer
    protection and related matters. The Company also received nearly
    identical demands in March 2007 from eight other state Attorneys
    General that are participating in the Multi-State Group. These
    demands include a CID from the Attorney General of the State of
    Arkansas, a CID from the Attorney General of the State of
    Illinois, a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of
    New Jersey, a subpoena from the State of Ohio, a CID from the
    State of Oregon Department of Justice, a subpoena from the
    Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a Request
    for Consumer Protection Information (“Request”) from
    the Attorney General of the State of Tennessee (which had issued
    an earlier Request in January 2007), and a subpoena from the
    Attorney General of the State of Vermont. TJX has been advised
    that the Attorneys General of two other states participating in
    the Multi-State Group may also issue their own demands, which if
    issued are expected to be substantively identical to the other
    demands TJX has received.

In addition to these demands, the Company also has received a
    number of other inquiries, requests and demands from state
    Attorneys General for information relating to the Computer
    Intrusion (most shortly after TJX announced the Computer
    Intrusion publicly and before the Multi-State Group commenced
    its investigation), including a request by the Attorney General
    of the State of Connecticut that the Company voluntarily provide
    written answers to various questions relating to the Computer
    Intrusion, a CID from the Secretary of the State of Rhode Island
    and verbal requests for information from various other state
    Attorneys General.

TJX also has been advised that the Federal Trade Commission
    (“FTC”) is investigating the Computer Intrusion to
    determine whether the Company may have violated federal law
    regarding consumer protection and related matters.

TJX also has been advised that the Office of the Privacy
    Commissioner of Canada and the Office of the Information and
    Privacy Commissioner of Alberta have initiated formal
    investigations of TJX as a result of the Computer Intrusion and
    that the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of
    British Columbia has initiated an investigation relating to the
    collection of personal information in connection with
    merchandise returns at TJX’s stores. The Office of the
    Privacy Commissioner of Quebec also has inquired about the
    Computer Intrusion, but has not advised the Company of any
    formal investigation.

TJX has been cooperating in each of these investigations.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion contains forward-looking information
    and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
    financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in
    this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the
    results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to
    various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of
    this report under the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended
    January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), January 28, 2006
    (fiscal 2006) and January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005).

In November 2006, we decided to close 34 A.J. Wright stores as
    part of a repositioning of the chain. The following discussion
    focuses on our results from continuing operations, which
    excludes the results of these 34 A.J. Wright stores. The cost to
    close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or
    loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued
    operation for all periods presented. The closings resulted in an
    after tax charge of $38 million, or $0.08 per share, in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and is discussed in more detail in
    Note C to the consolidated financial statements and below
    within the A.J. Wright discussion under “Segment
    Information.”

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we discovered that we
    had suffered an unauthorized intrusion into the portion of our
    computer systems that processes and stores information related
    to customer transactions. We do not know who took this action,
    whether there were one or more intruders involved, or whether
    there was one continuing intrusion or multiple, separate
    intrusions (we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively
    as the “Computer Intrusion”). We have been engaged in
    an ongoing investigation of the Computer Intrusion and computer
    security and incident response experts have been engaged to
    assist in the investigation. We believe customer data was stolen
    in the Computer Intrusion in 2005 and 2006. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of
    approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for
    costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the
    Computer Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate
    and contain the Computer Intrusion, enhance computer security
    and systems, and communicate with customers, as well as
    technical, legal, and other fees. Beyond this charge, we do not
    yet have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may
    incur arising from the Computer Intrusion. Such losses could be
    material to our results of operations and financial condition.
    For more information, see

Item 1-Business

under the caption “Computer Intrusion,” Note B to
    the consolidated financial statements and the discussion below
    under the caption “Potential liabilities in connection with
    Computer Intrusion.”

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2007 Overview:

—

Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $17.4 billion, a 9% increase
    over fiscal 2006.

—

Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2007 over
    the prior year driven by growth in unit sales and transactions
    across the majority of our businesses, as well as particularly
    strong same store sales growth at our international divisions.
    In addition, approximately one percentage point of this increase
    came from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates.

—

We increased our number of stores by 4% in fiscal 2007, ending
    the fiscal year with 2,466 stores in operation. Our selling
    square footage grew by 4% in fiscal 2007.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was
    $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to
    $689.8 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, last year.
    Results for prior years were impacted by certain charges and


one-time items that affect the comparability of reported
    results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on
    income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share
    (“EPS”) for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.

The third quarter events for fiscal 2006 include executive
    resignation agreements of $0.01 per share,

e-commerce

exit costs and operating losses of $0.01 per share, and
    hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost
    sales of $0.01 per share, partially offset by a gain from a
    VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement of ($0.01) per
    share.

We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more
    comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying
    trends in our business.

—

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of cost
    containment initiatives, we eliminated approximately 250
    positions (including 100 open positions) and twelve of our
    senior executives agreed to 10% base salary reductions. These
    actions resulted in an estimated annualized savings of
    approximately $18 million. We incurred a first quarter
    pre-tax charge in connection with the workforce reduction of
    $7 million.

—

Our pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales)
    improved from 6.3% in fiscal 2006 to 7.2% in fiscal 2007
    primarily due to improved merchandise margins and expense
    leverage from our cost containment initiatives. These
    improvements were partially offset by a planned increase in
    marketing expenses and the costs incurred in connection with the
    Computer Intrusion.

—

We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which
    allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our
    capital investment needs. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased
    22 million of our shares at a cost of $557 million,
    which favorably affected our earnings per share. In January
    2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase
    program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion
    of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to
    the $436 million which remained in the existing plan at
    fiscal 2007 year end. As a result of the discovery and
    investigation of the Computer Intrusion in December 2006, we
    temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity.

—

Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at
    our distribution centers, were up 7% at the end of fiscal 2007
    as compared to the prior year end when average per store
    inventories were down 11%. The increased inventories at fiscal
    2007 year end were primarily due to a higher in-stock
    position on spring transitional goods and an increase in the
    average unit retail price (“average ticket”). The
    decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of
    inventory in our distribution centers.

The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at
    the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an
    overview of operating results by segment. All references to
    earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. All prior
    periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results
    of the A.J. Wright store closings to discontinued operations.
    See Note C to our consolidated financial statements.

Net sales:

Net sales for fiscal 2007 totaled
    $17.4 billion, a 9% increase over net sales of
    $16.0 billion in fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006
    increased 7% over net sales of $14.9 billion for fiscal
    2005.

The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 includes a 5%
    increase attributable to new stores and a 4% increase in same
    store sales. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 over
    fiscal 2005 reflects 5% from new stores and 2% from same store
    sales.

New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated
    store count increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 7% in fiscal 2006
    over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square
    footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 8%


in fiscal 2006, in each case without adjustment for the A.J.
    Wright closed stores. Excluding the impact of the A.J. Wright
    store closings in fiscal 2007, our consolidated store count and
    total selling square footage each increased by 5% in fiscal
    2007. We expect to add 83 stores (net of store closings) in the
    fiscal year ending January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), a 3%
    projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect
    to increase our selling square footage base by 4%.

The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven
    by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as
    the strong performance at our international businesses
    (Winners’ same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same
    store sales increased 9%, both in local currency). Net sales for
    fiscal 2007 reflect growth in both apparel and home fashions.
    Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as
    well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for
    home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed
    well while our “soft” home categories (bedding,
    linens, etc.) were weak. Same store sales also benefited from
    the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls.
    During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments,
    bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear
    departments to 280. These stores had same store sales growth
    that exceeded the chain average. During fiscal 2008, we intend
    to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional
    Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory
    departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during
    fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having
    expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we plan to
    add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and
    relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing
    stores. In the United States, where TJX generates approximately
    80% of its sales, same store sales increased across almost all
    regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic areas
    experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth was
    favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which
    contributed approximately one percentage point of growth.

Net sales for fiscal 2006 reflected strong demand for jewelry,
    accessories and footwear, as well as improved demand for
    men’s apparel. The positive impact of growth in these
    categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in
    home fashions and women’s sportswear. Marmaxx continued its
    program of expanding jewelry and accessories and footwear
    departments and ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with
    expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls
    stores with expanded footwear departments. These stores had same
    store sales growth which exceeded Marmaxx’s chain average.
    In the United States, same store sales were strong in warm
    weather regions, particularly Florida, the Southwest and
    California, while flat to slightly negative in the Midwest and
    Northeast. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by
    foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately
    one-half of a percentage point of growth.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
    been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
    years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
    fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
    until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which
    stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
    beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
    constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
    calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
    prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned.
    Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are
    generally classified in the same way as the original store, and
    we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store
    percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store
    sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional
    same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions
    because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange
    rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the
    divisional operating performance.

The following table sets forth our consolidated operating
    results as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.9% in
    fiscal 2007, 76.6% in fiscal 2006 and 76.4% in fiscal 2005. This
    ratio for fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, reflects an
    improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin
    (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage due to
    our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same
    store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007
    expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some
    operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily
    occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points).

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a
    percentage of net sales for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal
    2005 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise
    margin of 0.5 percentage points. The improvement in
    merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our
    smaller divisions, partially offset by an increase in fuel
    related freight costs. In addition, the comparison to the fiscal
    2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a
    $30.7 million non-cash charge ($19.3 million
    after-tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting
    practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See
    Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the
    caption “Lease Accounting.” This charge was included
    in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased that year’s
    expense ratio by 0.2 percentage points. These improvements
    in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by
    increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales,
    primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de-levering impact
    of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales
    ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a
    greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses:

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2007,
    16.9% in fiscal 2006 and 16.7% in fiscal 2005. The
    0.1 percentage point decrease in fiscal 2007 reflects
    expense leverage across most categories, partially offset by a
    planned increase in marketing expense (0.1 percentage
    point). The increase in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005
    reflects an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of
    net sales, reflecting the de-levering impact of the low
    single-digit same store sales increase. The increase in this
    ratio for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was also
    negatively affected by the net impact of third quarter events
    including the costs of the executive resignation agreements,

e-commerce

exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by a
    VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement.

Interest expense, net:

Interest expense, net
    of interest income, was $15.6 million for fiscal 2007,
    $29.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $25.8 million in
    fiscal 2005. Interest income was $23.6 million in fiscal
    2007, $9.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $7.7 million in
    fiscal 2005. The decrease in net interest expense in fiscal 2007
    was due to the increase in interest income. The increase in
    interest income in fiscal 2007 was driven by higher cash
    balances and higher rates of return on short term investments.
    The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due to
    higher short-term borrowings and interest rates. The higher
    borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of
    inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the
    Company’s common stock. The additional interest expense
    from short-term borrowings was partially offset by reduced
    interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7%
    unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest
    income due to higher interest rates.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax
    rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2007, 31.6% in fiscal 2006 and 38.3% in
    fiscal 2005. The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income
    tax rate reflected the absence of one-time tax benefits recorded
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (described in more detail
    below) which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income
    tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. The fiscal 2007 effective
    income tax rate benefited through July 20, 2006 from the
    tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain
    intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax treatment
    reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by
    0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we
    re-designated one of these intercompany loans and the related
    hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains
    and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded
    in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition,
    the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted
    by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of
    which are taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as
    well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the
    related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the
    effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as
    compared to fiscal 2006.

The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter
    benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of earnings
    from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for the tax
    impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans.
    We previously established a deferred tax liability on these
    gains (which are not taxable). The impact of correcting for the
    tax treatment of these gains resulted in a tax benefit of
    $22 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The
    cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the
    third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of
    which was recorded in the fourth quarter of


fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million, $10.1 million
    related to fiscal 2005. These two items collectively reduced the
    fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage
    points. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements.

Income from continuing operations:

Income from
    continuing operations was $776.8 million in fiscal 2007,
    $689.8 million in fiscal 2006 and $610.2 million in
    fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations per share was
    $1.63 in fiscal 2007, $1.41 in fiscal 2006 and $1.21 in fiscal
    2005. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, TJX did not
    have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but will have a 53rd week in
    fiscal 2009.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely
    impacted by an after-tax charge relating to the Computer
    Intrusion of approximately $3 million, which reduced fourth
    quarter earnings per share by $0.01 per share. Income from
    continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by
    a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per share, due to
    the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of
    $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to the correction
    of a previously established deferred tax liability. Favorable
    changes in currency exchange rates added approximately $0.03 to
    our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and approximately $0.01
    per share in fiscal 2006.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely
    impacted by approximately $12 million, or $0.02 per
    share, due to the third quarter events. These third quarter
    events included the after-tax cost of executive resignation
    agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO
    ($5 million),

e-commerce

exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million),
    and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including
    the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of
    which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard
    antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Operating
    losses of the

e-commerce

operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely
    offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter
    operating loss in fiscal 2005.

Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was reduced by
    $19.3 million, or $0.04 per share, as a result of the
    after-tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre-tax,
    non-cash charge to conform our lease accounting practices to
    generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the
    consolidated financial statements under the caption “Lease
    Accounting.” Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange
    rates during fiscal 2005 added approximately $0.02 to our
    earnings per share.

The change in earnings per share from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007
    was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During
    fiscal 2007 we repurchased 22.0 million shares of our stock
    at a cost of $557 million, which was less than planned as
    we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006
    as a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer
    Intrusion. In fiscal 2006 we repurchased 25.9 million
    shares at a cost of $600 million. In January 2007, our
    Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that
    authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common
    stock from time to time, which is in addition to the
    $436 million remaining in the existing plan. We plan to
    continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008 with
    planned purchases of approximately $900 million.

Fourth Quarter Results:

Fourth quarter income
    from continuing operations was $243 million, or $0.51 per
    share, in fiscal 2007, $287 million, or $0.59 per share, in
    fiscal 2006 and $165 million, or $0.33 per share, in fiscal
    2005. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and fiscal
    2005 were impacted by certain charges and one-time items that
    affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below
    shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter income from
    continuing operations and earnings per share:

We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more
    comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying
    trends in our business.


Excluding these charges and one-time items from fiscal 2006, the
    fiscal 2007 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of
    $243 million increased 11% and earnings per share of $0.51
    increased 13%. Pre-tax profit margin was 7.5% in both fiscal
    2007 and fiscal 2006. Pre-tax margin improved on the strength of
    strong same-store sales at Winners, T.K. Maxx and HomeGoods,
    resulting in expense leverage across most categories. This
    improvement in the pre-tax margin was offset by costs related to
    the Computer Intrusion (0.1 percentage point), a planned
    increase in advertising expense (0.2 percentage points) and
    an increase in occupancy costs at T.K. Maxx (0.1 percentage
    point) as well as the year over year decline in A.J.
    Wright’s and Bob’s Stores’ segment profit margins.

Discontinued operations and net income:

Our
    results from continuing operations exclude the results of
    operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See
    “Segment Information — A.J. Wright” below
    and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for
    more information. Net income, which includes the impact of
    discontinued operations, was $738 million, or $1.55 per
    share for fiscal 2007, $690 million, or $1.41 per share for
    fiscal 2006 and $610 million, or $1.21 per share in fiscal
    2005.

Segment information:

The following is a
    discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We
    consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We
    evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment
    profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income before
    general corporate expense and interest. “Segment profit or
    loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
    activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
    liquidity. More detailed information about our segments,
    including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss”
    to “income from continuing operations before provision for
    income taxes” can be found in Note O to the
    consolidated financial statements. Presented below is selected
    financial information related to our business segments (U.S.
    dollars in millions):

Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each
    segment’s share of the cumulative pre-tax charge relating
    to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated
    financial statements under the caption “Lease
    Accounting.”

Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007,
    consistent with the prior year. Both apparel and home fashions
    reported same store sales growth in fiscal 2007 with apparel
    performing slightly better than home fashions. Same store sales
    of jewelry and accessories and footwear, combined, as well as
    misses sportswear and dresses were above the chain average. Same
    store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of
    footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added
    134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of
    expanded footwear stores to 280. During fiscal 2008, we intend
    to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional
    Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory
    departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during
    fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having
    expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we will add
    jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and
    relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing
    stores. Geographically in fiscal 2007, regions that performed
    above the chain average were the Southwest, Northeast and
    Mid-Atlantic.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
    margin”) increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in
    fiscal 2006. The increase in the fiscal 2007 segment margin was
    largely driven by 0.2 percentage point improvement in
    merchandise margin, primarily due to lower markdowns, and
    expense leverage across most categories due to our cost
    containment initiatives. Additionally, fiscal 2007 includes the
    favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee
    medical costs due to favorable claims experience. These
    improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an
    increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a
    planned increased in marketing costs (0.1 percentage
    point). As of January 27, 2007, average inventories per
    store were up 8% compared to a 10% decline at the prior year
    end. The increase at fiscal 2007 year end was primarily due
    to our in-stock position on spring transitional goods and


an increase in average ticket. The decline at the prior year end
    was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution
    centers.

Segment margin decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in
    fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was
    largely driven by the de-levering impact of a 2% same store
    sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios,
    primarily occupancy costs (which increased 0.3 percentage
    points) and distribution center costs (which increased
    0.1 percentage point). In addition, certain of the third
    quarter events described above

(e-commerce

and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the
    VISA/MasterCard settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal
    2006 by 0.1 percentage point. The comparison to the fiscal
    2005 margin was favorably impacted by the inclusion in fiscal
    2005’s segment profit of a $16.8 million charge for
    the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment, which
    reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 0.2 percentage
    points. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat
    compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in
    freight costs.

We added a net of 55 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in
    fiscal 2007, and increased total selling square footage of the
    division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of
    closings) in fiscal 2008, increasing the Marmaxx store base by
    3% and increasing its selling square footage by 3%.

Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses,
    for fiscal 2007 increased by 19% over fiscal 2006, with
    approximately one-third of this growth due to currency exchange
    rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in
    fiscal 2007 and decreased by 3% in fiscal 2006. Same store sales
    for fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by improved merchandise
    flow and increased brand penetration. In terms of product
    categories, same store sales were driven by strong growth in
    jewelry, footwear and accessories as well as home fashions.
    HomeSense performed well, favorably impacting this
    division’s results. Same store sales and operating results
    for HomeSense were significantly improved over the prior year.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 was up 2.1 percentage
    points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal 2006. This
    improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a
    1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins
    (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved
    expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase
    as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were
    partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs
    which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of
    net sales.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 improved by
    0.5 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005. This
    improvement was primarily due to a 2.9 percentage point increase
    in merchandise margins, which were driven by improved inventory
    management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower
    markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially
    offset by the de-levering impact of the 3% decline in same store
    sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a
    1.4 percentage point increase in occupancy and distribution
    costs being the most significant. Incremental costs associated
    with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also adversely affected
    segment profit. The comparison of segment profit and segment
    margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted
    by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a
    $3.5 million charge for this division’s share of the
    cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment.

We added a net of 10 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense stores in
    fiscal 2007, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by
    7%. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 3 HomeSense stores
    in fiscal 2008, increasing our total


Canadian store base by 3%, and increasing selling square footage
    by 3%. The store counts include the Winners and HomeSense
    portions of this division’s superstores, which either
    combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them

side-by-side.

As of January 27, 2007 we operated 29 of these superstores.

Net sales in fiscal 2007 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United
    Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 23% over fiscal 2006, with
    approximately one-fifth of this growth due to currency exchange
    rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 9%
    (in local currency) in fiscal 2007 with growth in both home
    fashions and most apparel categories. Apparel categories that
    performed well included dresses, accessories and footwear, while
    misses sportswear was below the chain average.

Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007
    compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point
    improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up
    0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns),
    as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales
    increase. These improvements were partially offset by an
    increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent,
    utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store
    relocations.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 declined
    0.3 percentage points to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx had an
    improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due to
    lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment profit
    and segment margin of fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 was favorably
    impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of
    this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease
    accounting adjustment of $6.5 million. These improvements
    however, were more than offset by an increase in occupancy
    expense due to higher cost for rent, utilities and property
    taxes as well as the de-levering impact of a 1% same store sales
    increase. Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage
    of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005,
    despite the low same store sales increase.

We added a net of 13 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007 and
    increased the division’s selling square footage by 10%. We
    plan to open a net of 10 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2008, and
    expand selling square footage by 7%. Also, we expect to expand
    into Germany with 5 store openings planned for fiscal 2008.

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007, due to
    strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment
    profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million,
    and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The
    increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from the
    leverage of expenses across most categories, most notably in
    distribution center and occupancy expenses. Additionally,
    merchandise margin increased 0.4 percentage points primarily due
    to higher markon.

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2006.
    Customer transactions and unit sales increased at HomeGoods
    during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these increases
    were partially offset by a decline in the


average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise
    mix. Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from
    $18.1 million, and segment profit margin increased to 2.4%
    of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in
    segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in
    merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the
    impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior
    year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of
    $2.2 million.

We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2007, an 8%
    increase, and increased selling square footage of the division
    by 7%. In fiscal 2008, we plan to add a net of 12 HomeGoods
    stores and increase selling square footage by 5%.

A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal
    2007, consistent with the prior year. A.J. Wright’s segment
    loss for fiscal 2007 increased to $10.3 million compared to
    $3.2 million for the prior year. This decline is primarily
    the result of a decrease in merchandise margin
    (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below-plan
    sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a
    plan to reposition this business, we identified 34
    underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of
    which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to
    close these stores and their historical operating results are
    presented as discontinued operations as described below. By
    closing these marginally profitable stores, we reduced the
    number of advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates
    enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater
    efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store
    closings also allow management to focus their attention and
    resources on the remaining, better performing stores.

A.J. Wright’s same store sales increased 3% for fiscal
    2006, compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal
    2005. A.J. Wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was
    narrowed to $3.2 million from $18.8 million in fiscal
    2005. This improvement was driven by improved merchandise
    margin, primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006.
    The comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion
    of a $1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of
    the lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective
    expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a
    percentage of sales across most expense categories, primarily in
    advertising and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the
    number of our new store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006
    and fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2005 as we believed that
    the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too
    aggressive for this division, placing a strain on operations.

The table above presents A.J. Wright’s operating results
    from continuing operations. Stores in operation and selling
    square footage for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include store
    counts and square footage for the stores that are part of our
    discontinued operations. As described earlier, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, we identified 34 underperforming A.J.
    Wright stores to be closed as part of our plan to reposition
    this business. In connection with this action, we incurred an
    after-tax charge of $38 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth
    quarter. This charge represents costs related to asset
    impairment, remaining lease liability (net of expected subtenant
    income), and severance and other costs. We have classified these
    exit costs, along with operating income or loss related to these
    stores, as discontinued operations in our financial statements
    for all periods presented. The operating income or loss for each
    year represents the operating results from store operations,
    reduced by an allocation of direct and incremental distribution
    and administrative costs relating to the closed stores. No
    interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations.
    The following table presents the net sales and segment profit
    (loss) of the closed stores in operation for the last three
    fiscal years which have been reclassified to discontinued
    operations:

Bob’s Stores’ net sales increased 4% for fiscal 2007,
    compared to a slight decrease last year. Same store sales
    increased 2% with our expanded women’s casual sportswear
    departments performing well. Bob’s Stores reduced its
    segment losses for the fiscal year due to the sales growth
    combined with significant improvement in merchandise margins.
    Merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon, the
    result of better buying, which more than offset increases in
    promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of
    promotions in this business.

Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year,
    primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional
    advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin improved in
    fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns) the sales
    decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased
    segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Segment
    loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of
    $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work
    force at Bob’s Stores.

For fiscal 2008, we do not plan to open any new stores for this
    division as we continue to evaluate this business and assess its
    potential for future growth.

General corporate expense

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are
    those costs not specifically related to the operations of our
    business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate
    office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock
    based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and
    operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and
    budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor
    relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and
    systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs
    associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general
    corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing
    retirees and non-operating costs and other gains and losses not
    attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense
    is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
    the consolidated statements of income.

Fiscal 2007 included pre-tax charges of approximately
    $5 million related to the Computer Intrusion, and
    approximately $5 million related to the corporate
    division’s cost of the workforce reduction and other
    termination benefits, while fiscal 2006 included costs of
    $9 million associated with executive resignation agreements
    and $6 million of costs to exit the e- commerce business.
    The increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007
    over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll,
    corporate marketing and consulting costs, charitable
    contributions, and European expansion costs.

The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over
    fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with
    executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of
    exiting the

e-commerce

business of ($6 million). Both of these


items occurred in our third quarter ended October 29, 2005.
    In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2006 includes
    a charge ($4 million) in connection with an idle leased
    facility.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $1,195.0 million in fiscal 2007, $1,158.0 million in
    fiscal 2006 and $1,076.8 million in fiscal 2005. The cash
    generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
    years was largely due to operating earnings.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by $
    37.0 million driven by an increase in net income (adjusted
    for depreciation) of $86.4 million. The change in
    inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year-end levels
    was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal
    2007, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related
    change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of
    $151.2 million compared to a source of cash of
    $26.2 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash
    flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments. These
    reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to
    fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of
    changes in deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and
    prepaid expenses.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 increased by $
    81.2 million compared to operating cash flows for fiscal
    2005. Net income (adjusted for depreciation) for fiscal 2006
    increased by approximately $116 million. The change in
    merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts
    payable, resulted in a source of cash of $26.2 million in
    fiscal 2006 compared to a use of cash of $85.3 million in
    fiscal 2005. These increases in fiscal 2006 operating cash flow
    as compared to fiscal 2005 were offset by the unfavorable cash
    impact of changes in prepaid expenses and deferred taxes.

The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change
    in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years
    is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels
    at each year end period. Average per store inventories at
    January 27, 2007, including inventory on hand at our
    distribution centers, increased 7% compared to a decrease of 11%
    at January 28, 2006. This compares to inventories per store
    at January 29, 2005 that were up 1% compared to the prior
    year.

Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a
    reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that
    relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of
    our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated
    financial statements) as well as leases of former TJX
    businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the
    last three fiscal years is presented below:

The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted
    in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal
    2007. All other additions to the reserve are the result of
    periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our
    former businesses and are offset by income from creditor
    recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges
    against the reserve during each fiscal year relate primarily to
    our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other
    charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 relate primarily to
    the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were
    closed at the end of fiscal 2007.


Approximately $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve
    balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our
    estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income.
    The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost
    of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are
    likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original
    lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after
    mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At
    January 27, 2007, substantially all the leases of former
    businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the
    landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. The
    actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from
    our original estimate. Although TJX’s actual costs with
    respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed
    amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for
    leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or
    had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs
    related to these discontinued operations in excess of the
    amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of this reserve
    will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing
    of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease
    obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which
    BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
    we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
    with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
    financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

Potential
    liabilities in connection with Computer Intrusion

We believe that customer information was stolen in the Computer
    Intrusion in 2005 and 2006 and that such information most likely
    primarily relates to transactions at our stores (other than
    Bob’s Stores) during the periods 2003 through June 2004 and
    mid-May 2006 through mid-December 2006. See

Item 1-Business

under the caption “Computer Intrusion”.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax
    charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per
    share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in
    connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs
    incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion,
    strengthen computer security and systems, and communicate with
    customers, and for technical, legal and other fees. In addition,
    various litigation and claims have been (or may be) asserted
    against us

and/or

our
    acquiring banks on behalf of customers (including various
    putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all
    customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose
    transaction information was allegedly compromised by the
    Computer Intrusion), banks and payment card companies seeking
    damages allegedly arising out of the Computer Intrusion and
    other related relief (including a putative class action seeking
    to represent all financial institutions that issued payment
    cards to our customers used at our stores during the period of
    the Computer Intrusion) and shareholders. We intend to defend
    such litigation and claims vigorously, although the outcome of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted. In addition,
    various governmental agencies are investigating the Computer
    Intrusion, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations
    as a result of these investigations. Certain banks have sought,
    and other banks and payment card companies may seek, either
    directly against us or through claims against our acquiring
    banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation, payment
    of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating
    expenses that they believe they have incurred by reason of the
    Computer Intrusion, and payment card companies and associations
    may seek to impose fines by reason of the Computer Intrusion. We
    do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate losses
    that may result from such litigation, claims and investigations.
    As such, no liability has been recorded as of January 27,
    2007. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes
    known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or
    times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and
    the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Such losses
    could be material to our results of operations and financial
    condition. Regardless of the outcome, claims, litigation and
    proceedings of this type are expensive and could require us to
    devote substantial resources and time to defending them.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have
    contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or
    guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX
    being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have
    assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed
    to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of
    leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely
    had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we
    do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about
    these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations
    under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or
    more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations
    related to one or more of these leases.


We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties
    of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the
    subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
    $105 million as of January 27, 2007. We believe that
    most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
    TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
    substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

Investing activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
    expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table
    below:

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate

    through internally generated funds. This includes
    $108 million for new stores, $267 million for store
    renovations, expansions and improvements and $125 million
    for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in
    capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on
    renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly
    T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx, as well as an increase in
    capital spending for systems enhancements and improvements to
    the distribution centers.

Financing activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
    outflows of $418.0 million in fiscal 2007,
    $503.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $584.6 million in
    fiscal 2005. The majority of this outflow relates to our share
    repurchase program.

We spent $557.2 million in fiscal 2007, $603.7 million
    in fiscal 2006 and $594.6 million in fiscal 2005 under our
    stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 22.0 million
    shares in fiscal 2007, 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006
    and 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005. All shares
    repurchased were retired. Through January 27, 2007, under
    our current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program,
    we had spent $564 million on the repurchase of
    22.3 million shares of TJX common stock. As a result of the
    discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion in
    December 2006, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase
    activity. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new
    stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to
    $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is
    in addition to the $436 million remaining in the existing
    plan at fiscal 2007 year end.

In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million
    (US$204.4) term credit facility, guaranteed by TJX. This credit
    facility was originally due in January 2009 and has been
    extended to January 2010. Interest is payable at rates equal to,
    or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an
    interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a
    fixed interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The
    proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings
    to TJX as well as other general corporate purposes of this
    division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal
    payments on long-term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006
    and $5 million in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2007, there were
    no scheduled principal payments on long-term debt.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
    totaled $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007, $0.24 per share in
    fiscal 2006 and $0.18 per share in fiscal 2005. Cash payments
    for dividends on our common stock totaled $122.9 million in
    fiscal 2007, $105.3 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $83.4 million in fiscal 2005. Financing activities also


included proceeds of $260.2 in fiscal 2007, $102.4 million
    in fiscal 2006 and $96.9 million in fiscal 2005 from the
    exercise of employee stock options.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
    requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
    bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
    In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four-year
    revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five-year
    revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal
    2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until
    May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These credit facilities
    have no compensating balance requirements and have various
    covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt
    to earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to
    which we issue commercial paper from time to time. These
    agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program. As
    of January 27, 2007, we had no short-term debt outstanding.
    The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding
    was $205 million during fiscal 2007, $567 million
    during fiscal 2006, and $5 million during fiscal 2005. The
    weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings
    was 5.35% in fiscal 2007, 3.69% in fiscal 2006 and 2.04% in
    fiscal 2005.

As of January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line
    for operating expenses was C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007,
    C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, and C$6.8 million in
    fiscal 2005, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of
    these lines at the end of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. As of
    January 27, 2007, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling
    £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal
    2007 was £10.5 million and there were no outstanding
    borrowings on this credit line at January 27, 2007.

We believe that internally generated funds and our current
    credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating
    needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to
    the consolidated financial statements for further information
    regarding our long-term debt and available financing sources.

Contractual obligations:

As of
    January 27, 2007, we had payment obligations (including
    current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases
    for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will
    require cash outflows as follows (in thousands):

The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest
    costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible
    subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2014. If
    none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not
    redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The
    effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based
    on their values as of January 27, 2007.

The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent
    and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and
    common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay.
    These costs were approximately one-third of the total minimum
    rent for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders
    for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures,
    supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts
    for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
    executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long-term
    agreements for services and operating needs that can be
    cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which include
    $120.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, most
    of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts
    of approximately $100.0 million, the majority of which come


due in fiscal 2010, and $142.0 million for accrued rent,
    the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease
    commitments in the above table.

Critical Accounting Policies

TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We
    consider our most critical accounting policies, involving
    management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to
    inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance,
    accounting for taxes, reserves for discontinued operations and
    loss contingencies. We believe that we have selected the most
    appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that
    the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions
    been selected, would not be materially different from the
    results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method
    for valuing inventory on a

first-in

first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of
    inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a

cost-to-retail

ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This
    method is widely used in the retail industry and involves
    management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and
    inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording
    and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method,
    permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation
    when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail
    method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than
    other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business
    practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to
    be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates.
    Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for
    interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at
    fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and
    estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results,
    but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe
    that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent
    markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each
    fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is
    fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with
    vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain
    conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory.
    Our off-price businesses have historically not entered into such
    arrangements with our vendors. Bob’s Stores, the
    value-oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have
    vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising
    dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may
    have some impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation
    but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are
    accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in
    the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in
    the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are
    required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the
    discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term
    rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of
    which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The
    discount rate, which we determine annually based on market
    interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return,
    which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two
    factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost
    of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified
    pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million,
    which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years
    to largely restore the funded status of our plan.

Casualty insurance:

TJX’s casualty
    insurance program requires TJX to estimate the total claims it
    will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost. The
    estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an
    actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These
    estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and
    actual results could differ from these estimates. If TJX’s
    estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance
    expense for fiscal 2007 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2007
    pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately
    $5 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with
    a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our
    estimated claims accrual. The company has a net accrual of
    $31.4 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty
    insurance program as of January 27, 2007.

Accounting for taxes:

Like many large
    corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States
    federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of
    income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In
    evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various
    tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures.
    Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we
    have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for
    possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters
    for which accruals have been established or be required to pay
    amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in
    a given financial period might be materially impacted. The
    Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended
    January 2000 through January 2003 and several proposed
    adjustments are under appeal. We also have various state and
    foreign tax examinations in process.


Reserves for discontinued operations:

As
    discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial
    statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and
    analysis, we have reserves established for leases relating to
    operations discontinued by TJX where TJX was the original lessee
    or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties.
    These are long-term obligations and the estimated cost to us
    involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we
    remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, amounts of
    subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be
    settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification,
    may exist. We develop these assumptions based on past experience
    and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the
    circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual
    results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our
    current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely
    outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate
    cost we will incur.

Loss Contingencies:

Certain conditions may
    exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which
    may result in a loss to TJX but which will not be resolved until
    one or more future events occur or fail to occur. TJX’s
    management and its legal counsel assess such contingent
    liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise
    of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
    proceedings that are pending against TJX or unasserted claims
    that may result in such proceedings, TJX’s legal counsel
    evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
    unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount
    of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
    that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
    be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment
    indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not
    probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot
    be estimated, then TJX will disclose the nature of the
    contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of
    the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans -An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132 (R)” (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158
    requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan
    in the balance sheet; the recognition in other comprehensive
    income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits
    arising during the period but which are not included as
    components of periodic benefit cost; the measurement of defined
    benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date
    (the measurement provisions); and disclosure of additional
    information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the
    following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the
    current period. The requirement to recognize the funded status
    of the plan on the balance sheet is required for the fiscal year
    ended January 27, 2007 and is reflected in our accompanying
    financial statements. The adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income of initially applying the recognition
    provisions of SFAS No. 158 was a reduction, net of
    taxes, of $5.6 million. The requirement to measure the plan
    assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date can be
    deferred until our fiscal year ending January 2008. The current
    measurement date of our plans is December 31 and we have elected
    to defer adopting the measurement provisions until next fiscal
    year. The impact of applying the measurement provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 will not have a material impact on our
    statement of financial position.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
    financial statements. The Interpretation requires that we
    determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing
    authority. If a tax position meets the more likely than not
    recognition criteria, FIN 48 requires the tax position be
    measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50%
    likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48
    must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial
    adoption. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006 (fiscal 2008 for the
    Company). Upon adoption, we anticipate an increase to our
    reserves for uncertain tax positions. We do not expect that the
    impact will be material to our financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair
    value of their financial instruments according to a fair value
    hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies
    are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial
    instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a
    reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately
    for each major category of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements


issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material
    impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

ITEM 7A.  Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
    investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European
    (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A
    and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a
    significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations;
    intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain
    merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations;
    with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative
    contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We
    utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset
    the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these
    gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’
    equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
    creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
    industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
    exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
    underlying exposures described above. As of January 27,
    2007, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would
    not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain
    lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in
    interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In
    addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings will
    affect the impact on our future interest expense of future
    changes in interest rates. We occasionally enter into financial
    instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe
    that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure
    to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates
    applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the
    previous year. As of January 27, 2007, the analysis
    indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

Market Risk

The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of
    which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks
    and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the
    pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control
    our exposure to these market uncertainties.

Controls and
    Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the
    period covered by this report pursuant to

Rules 13a-15

and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that


evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective in ensuring that information required to be
    disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
    Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
    procedures.

(b)

Changes in
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007 identified in connection with our Chief Executive
    Officer’s and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Internal control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d — 15(f) promulgated under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, TJX’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
    functions, and effected by TJX’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

—

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of TJX;

—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of TJX are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    TJX’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
    assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of TJX’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, TJX conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 27, 2007 based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation,
    management concluded that its internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of January 27, 2007.

(d) Attestation
    Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm, that audited and reported on our consolidated
    financial statements contained herein, has audited
    management’s assessment of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 27, 2007, and has issued
    an attestation report on management’s assessment of our
    internal control over financial reporting included herein.

    Inc.’s 2007 and 2006 consolidated financial statements and
    of its internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 27, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) at January 27, 2007
    and January 28, 2006, and the results of their operations
    and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended January 27, 2007 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note J to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, effective January 27, 2007, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment
    of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),

as of
    January 27, 2007.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 9A, that the
    Company maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 27, 2007 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
    Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 27, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
    is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with

F-2

generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

A. Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated
    financial statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
    “TJX”, the “Company” or “we”)
    include the financial statements of all of TJX’s
    subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of TJX’s
    activities are conducted within TJX or our subsidiaries and are
    consolidated in these financial statements. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s fiscal year ends on
    the last Saturday in January. The fiscal years ended
    January 27, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”),
    January 28, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”) and
    January 29, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”) each included
    52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share
    amounts discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless
    otherwise indicated.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the
    financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States, requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
    liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as
    the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. TJX considers the more significant accounting
    policies that involve management estimates and judgments to be
    those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations,
    casualty insurance, accounting for taxes, reserves for
    discontinued operations and loss contingencies. Actual amounts
    could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at
    the time of sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net
    of a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based
    upon our historical experience. We defer recognition of a
    layaway sale and its related profit to the accounting period
    when the customer receives layaway merchandise. Proceeds from
    the sale of gift cards are deferred until the customer uses the
    gift card to acquire merchandise. Based on historical experience
    we estimate the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed
    and, to the extent allowed by local law, these amounts are
    amortized into income over the redemption period.

Consolidated Statements of Income
    Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying
    and occupancy costs, include the cost of merchandise sold and
    gains and losses on inventory-related derivative contracts;
    store occupancy costs (including real estate taxes, utility and
    maintenance costs, and fixed asset depreciation); the costs of
    operating our distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel
    costs directly associated with buying inventory; and systems
    costs related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
    payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
    expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
    payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
    costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
    related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally
    considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
    months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
    Our investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper,
    institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
    banks. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying
    value.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are
    stated at the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail
    method for valuing inventories on the

first-in

first-out basis. We almost exclusively utilize a permanent
    markdown strategy and lower the cost value of the inventory that
    is subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered
    in our stores. We accrue for inventory obligations at the time
    inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by
    TJX. At January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the
    amount of in-transit inventory included in merchandise
    inventories on the balance sheet was $346.2 million and
    $340.6 million, respectively. A comparable amount is
    reflected in accounts payable.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions
    consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
    our stock repurchase program and the issuance of common stock
    under our stock incentive plan. Under the stock repurchase
    program we repurchase our common stock on the open market. The
    par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock
    with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged
    against any available additional paid-in capital
    (“APIC”) and the balance charged to retained earnings.
    Due to the high volume of repurchases over the past several
    years we have no remaining balance in APIC. All shares
    repurchased have been retired.

F-8

Shares issued under our stock incentive plan are generally
    issued from authorized but previously unissued shares, and
    proceeds received are recorded by increasing common stock for
    the par value of the shares with the excess over par added to
    APIC. Income tax benefits upon the expensing of options result
    in the creation of a deferred tax asset, while income tax
    benefits due to the exercise of stock options reduce deferred
    tax assets to the extent that an asset for the related grant has
    been created. Any tax benefit greater than the deferred tax
    asset created at the time of expensing the option is credited to
    APIC; any deficiency in the tax benefit is debited to APIC to
    the extent a ‘pool’ for such deficiency exists. In the
    absence of a pool any deficiency is realized in the related
    periods’ statements of income through the provision for
    income taxes. The excess income tax benefits, if any, are
    included in cash flows from financing activities in the
    statements of cash flows. The par value of restricted stock
    awards is also added to common stock when the stock is issued,
    generally at grant date. The fair value of the restricted stock
    awards in excess of par value is added to APIC as the award is
    amortized into earnings over the related vesting period.

Stock-Based Compensation:

TJX adopted the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004)

“Share-Based
    Payment”

(SFAS No. 123(R)) in its fourth
    quarter reporting period of fiscal 2006. TJX elected the
    modified retrospective transition method and accordingly all
    periods presented reflect the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R). For purposes of applying the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of each
    option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. See Note G for a
    detailed discussion of stock-based compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest expense, net was
    $15.6 million, $29.6 million and $25.8 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense is
    presented net of interest income of $23.6 million,
    $9.4 million and $7.7 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. We capitalize interest during the active
    construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized
    interest is added to the cost of the related assets. No interest
    was capitalized in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005. Debt discount and
    related issue expenses are amortized to interest expense over
    the lives of the related debt issues or to the first date the
    holders of the debt may require TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial
    reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and
    amortization of property by the use of the straight-line method
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are
    depreciated over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements
    are generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
    lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
    Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
    10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
    property was $347.0 million for fiscal 2007,
    $307.7 million for fiscal 2006 and $268.0 million for
    fiscal 2005. Amortization expense for property held under a
    capital lease was $2.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
    incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed
    software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 10 years.
    Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the
    related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or
    loss is included in net income. Pre-opening costs, including
    rent, are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

During fiscal 2005, we
    recorded a one-time non-cash charge to conform our accounting
    policies to generally accepted accounting principles related to
    the timing of rent expense for certain leased locations.
    Previously, we began recording rent expense at the time a store
    opened and the lease term commenced as specified in the lease.
    Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we record rent
    expense when we take possession of a store, which occurs before
    the commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease,
    and generally 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the
    store. This will result in an acceleration of the commencement
    of rent expense for each lease, as we record rent expense during
    the pre-opening period, but a reduction in monthly rent expense,
    as the total rent due under the lease is amortized over a
    greater number of months.

This correction resulted in a one-time, cumulative, non-cash
    charge of $30.7 million on a pre tax basis
    ($19.3 million net of tax), or $0.04 per share, which
    we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The pre-tax
    cumulative effect of the correction reduced segment profit as
    follows; Marmaxx $16.8 million, Winners and HomeSense
    $3.5 million, T.K. Maxx $6.5 million, HomeGoods
    $2.2 million and A.J. Wright $1.7 million.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

TJX
    periodically reviews the value of its property and intangible
    assets in relation to the current and expected operating results
    of the related business segments in order to assess whether
    there has been an other than temporary impairment of their
    carrying values. An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash
    flow of an asset is less than the carrying cost of that asset.

Store-by-store

impairment analysis is performed at a minimum on an annual basis
    in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year.

F-9

Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily
    the excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of
    the minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s
    former 83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated
    with the T.J. Maxx chain which is included in the Marmaxx
    segment in all periods presented. In addition, goodwill includes
    the excess of cost over the estimated fair market value of the
    net assets of Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill, net of amortization, totaled $71.9 million,
    $72.0 million and $71.8 million as of January 27,
    2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005,
    respectively, and is considered to have an indefinite life and,
    accordingly is no longer amortized. Cumulative amortization was
    $33.0 million as of January 27, 2007,
    $33.1 million as of January 28, 2006 and
    $33.0 million at January 29, 2005. Changes in goodwill
    cost and accumulated amortization are attributable to the effect
    of exchange rate changes on Winners reported goodwill.

Tradenames include the values assigned to the name
    “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 when we
    acquired the Marshalls chain, and to the name “Bob’s
    Stores” acquired by TJX in December 2003 when we acquired
    substantially all of the assets of Bob’s Stores. These
    values were determined by the discounted present value of
    assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a reduction for
    their pro-rata share of negative goodwill.

The Marshalls tradename, net of accumulated amortization, is
    carried at a value of $107.7 million, and is considered to
    have an indefinite life and, accordingly, is no longer
    amortized. The Bob’s Stores tradename, pursuant to the
    purchase accounting method, was valued at $4.8 million
    which is being amortized over 10 years. Amortization
    expense of $477,000, $477,000 and $483,000 was recognized in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cumulative
    amortization as of January 27, 2007, January 28, 2006
    and January 29, 2005 was $1.5 million, $993,000 and
    $516,000, respectively.

TJX occasionally acquires other trademarks in connection with
    private label merchandise. Such trademarks are included in other
    assets and are amortized to cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, over the term of the agreement generally from 7
    to 10 years. Amortization expense related to trademarks was
    $499,000, $492,000 and $492,000 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company had $1.7 million,
    $2.2 million and $2.7 million in trademarks, net of
    accumulated amortization, at January 27, 2007,
    January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.
    Trademarks and the related amortization are included in the
    related operating segment for which they were acquired.

An impairment analysis is performed for goodwill and tradenames
    at a minimum on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of a
    fiscal year. No impairments have been recorded on these assets
    to date.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising
    costs as incurred. Advertising expense was $244.7 million,
    $203.0 million and $185.5 million for fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss):

TJX’s foreign assets and liabilities
    are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rate. Activity of
    the foreign operations that affect the statements of income and
    cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates
    prevailing during the fiscal year. The translation adjustments
    associated with the foreign operations are included in
    shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Cumulative foreign currency translation
    adjustments included in shareholders’ equity amounted to a
    loss of $3.2 million, net of related tax effect of
    $15.8 million, as of January 27, 2007; a loss of
    $23.6 million, net of related tax effect of
    $17.7 million, as of January 28, 2006; and a gain of
    $8.9 million, net of related tax effect of
    $11.0 million, as of January 29, 2005.

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
    borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. TJX recognizes all derivative
    instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statements of
    financial position and measures those instruments at fair value.
    Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the
    period of the change. For derivatives that qualify for hedge
    accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
    either recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    other comprehensive income or are recognized currently in
    earnings, along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis
    of the item being hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on
    derivatives that have hedged our net investment in foreign
    operations and deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges that
    have been recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a
    loss of $25.2 million, net of related tax effects of
    $16.8 million at January 27, 2007; a loss of
    $20.7 million, net of related tax effects of
    $13.8 million at January 28, 2006; and a loss of
    $35.1 million, net of related tax effects of
    $23.4 million as of January 29, 2005.

F-10

The requirement to recognize the funded status of our post
    retirement benefit plans in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158 (discussed below) resulted in a loss
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of
    $5.6 million, net of related tax effects of
    $3.7 million at January 27, 2007. There was no similar
    adjustment made in fiscal 2006 or 2005.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for
    loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss has been
    incurred and that the amount of the loss is reasonably
    estimable. TJX reviews pending litigation and other
    contingencies at least quarterly and adjusts the liability as
    needed. TJX includes an estimate for related legal costs at the
    time such costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

New Accounting Standards:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R)” (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158
    requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan
    in the balance sheet; the recognition in other comprehensive
    income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits
    arising during the period but which are not included as
    components of periodic benefit cost; the measurement of defined
    benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date
    (the measurement provisions); and disclosure of additional
    information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the
    following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the
    current period. The recognition of the funded status of plans on
    the balance sheet is required for our fiscal year ended
    January 27, 2007 and is reflected in these financial
    statements. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income of initially applying the recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 was a reduction, net of taxes, of
    $5.6 million. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158
    on individual line items of the balance sheet as of
    January 27, 2007 is summarized below:

The requirement to measure the plan assets and obligations as of
    the balance sheet date can be deferred until our fiscal year
    ending January 2008. The current measurement date of our plans
    is December 31 and we have elected to defer adopting the
    measurement provisions until next fiscal year. The impact of
    applying the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158
    will not have a material effect on our statement of financial
    position.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
    financial statement. FIN 48 requires that we determine
    whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority
    and if so, recognize the largest amount of benefit greater than
    50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon
    initial adoption. This accounting standard is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (fiscal 2008
    for the Company). Upon adoption, we anticipate an increase to
    our reserves for uncertain tax positions. We do not expect that
    the impact will be material to our financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair
    value of their financial instruments according to a fair value
    hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies
    are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial
    instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a
    reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately
    for each major category of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements

F-11

issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material
    impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

B. Contingency Related to Computer Intrusion

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, TJX discovered that it
    had suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions into
    portions of its computer system that process and store
    information related to credit and debit card, check and
    unreceipted merchandise return transactions (the intrusion or
    intrusions, collectively, the “Computer Intrusion”).
    TJX has been engaged in an ongoing investigation of the Computer
    Intrusion, and computer security and incident response experts
    have been engaged to assist in the investigation. TJX believes
    that customer information was stolen in the Computer Intrusion
    in 2005 and 2006 and that such information most likely primarily
    relates to transactions at its stores (other than Bob’s
    Stores) during the periods 2003 through June 2004 and
    mid-May2006 through mid-December 2006.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre-tax
    charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per
    share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in
    connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs
    incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion,
    strengthen computer security and systems, and communicate with
    customers, and for technical, legal and other fees. In addition,
    various litigation and claims have been (or may be) asserted
    against us

and/or

our
    acquiring banks on behalf of customers (including various
    putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all
    customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose
    transaction information was allegedly compromised by the
    Computer Intrusion), banks and payment card companies seeking
    damages allegedly arising out of the Computer Intrusion and
    other related relief (including a putative class action seeking
    to represent all financial institutions that issued payment
    cards to our customers used at our stores during the period of
    the Computer Intrusion) and shareholders. We intend to defend
    such litigation and claims vigorously, although the outcome of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted. In addition,
    various governmental agencies are investigating the Computer
    Intrusion, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations
    as a result of these investigations. Certain banks have sought,
    and other banks and payment card companies may seek, either
    directly against us or through claims against our acquiring
    banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation, payment
    of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating
    expenses that they believe they have incurred by reason of the
    Computer Intrusion, and payment card companies and associations
    may seek to impose fines by reason of the Computer Intrusion. We
    do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate losses
    that may result from such litigation, claims and investigations.
    As such, no liability has been recorded as of January 27,
    2007. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes
    known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or
    times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and
    the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Such losses
    could be material to our results of operations and financial
    condition.

C. Discontinued Operations — A.J. Wright store
    closings

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 management developed a
    plan to close 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores. The plan
    was approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of
    Directors on November 27, 2006, and virtually all of the
    stores were closed as of the end of fiscal 2007.

In its continuing effort to improve the performance of A.J.
    Wright, management performed an analysis of its store locations
    and operating performance. Management’s plan for the store
    closures was based on several factors, including market
    demographics and proximity to other A.J. Wright stores, cash
    return, sales volume and productivity, recent comparable store
    sales and profit trends and overall market performance. The 34
    stores represented approximately 21% of A.J. Wright’s store
    base, but only 16% of its

year-to-date

sales and had store profit margins significantly below the
    average of the A.J. Wright chain.

We recorded fourth quarter pre-tax charges of approximately
    $62 million in connection with these A.J. Wright store
    closures. A summary of the estimated charges (in millions) is
    presented below:

Asset impairments relate primarily to store fixtures and
    leasehold improvements. Lease costs include assumptions about
    the timing and amount of subtenant income and other expenses and
    actual results may cause the lease costs to vary from the above
    estimate.

The above charges do not include the cash impact of
    $24 million of estimated income tax benefits, which
    generally will be realized when lease and severance obligations
    are paid or assets are sold or otherwise disposed of. The
    after-tax cost of the store closings of $38.1 million, or
    $0.08 per share, was recorded as a loss on disposal of
    discontinued operations in our fourth quarter and fiscal year
    ending January 27, 2007.

In addition to the above charges, we classified the operating
    income (loss) of the 34 closed stores for the current fiscal
    year, as well as all prior periods, as a component of
    discontinued operations. The operating income or loss for each
    year equals the operating results from store operations, reduced
    by an allocation of direct and incremental distribution and
    administrative costs relating to the closed stores. No interest
    expense was allocated to the discontinued operations. The
    following table presents the net sales and segment profit (loss)
    of the closed A.J. Wright stores for the last three fiscal years
    which have been reclassified to discontinued operations:

In January 2006, we entered into a C$235.0 million term
    credit facility (through our Canadian division, Winners) due in
    January, 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is
    payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or
    less than Canadian prime rate. The variable rate on this note
    was 4.34% at January 27, 2007. The proceeds were used to
    fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian division as
    well as other general corporate purposes of this division.

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
    gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
    notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. Due to the
    first put option on February 13, 2002, we amortized the
    debt discount assuming a 1.5% yield for fiscal 2002. The notes
    are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness
    of TJX. The notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares
    of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our common stock
    reaches specified thresholds, if the credit rating of the notes
    is below investment grade, if the notes are called for
    redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur
    (see Note H). Each holder of the notes has the right to
    require us to purchase the notes on February 13, 2013 at
    original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount for
    a total of $441.3 million for all notes. We may pay the
    purchase price in cash, TJX stock or a combination of the two.
    If the holders exercise their put options, we expect to fund the
    payment with cash, financing from our short-term credit
    facility, new long-term borrowings or a combination thereof.
    There were two notes put to TJX on February 13, 2007 and
    three on February 13, 2004. In addition, if a change in
    control of TJX occurs on or before February 13, 2013, each
    holder may require TJX to purchase for cash all or a portion of
    such holder’s notes. We may redeem for cash all, or a
    portion of, the notes at any time on or after February 13,
    2007 for the original purchase price plus accrued original issue
    discount.

The fair value of our general corporate debt, including current
    installments, is estimated by obtaining market value quotes
    given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
    issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
    of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is estimated
    by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of general corporate
    debt, including current installments, at January 27, 2007
    is $405.7 million versus a carrying value of
    $394.6 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes, as of January 27, 2007, is
    $503.9 million versus a carrying value of
    $391.0 million. These estimates do not necessarily reflect
    certain provisions or restrictions in the various debt
    agreements which might affect our ability to settle these
    obligations.

In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million four-year
    revolving credit facility and our $500 million five-year
    revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal
    2006) to extend the maturity dates of these agreements
    until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These agreements have
    no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants
    including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to
    earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to
    which we issue commercial paper from time to time. The revolving
    credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper
    program. As of January 27, 2007 there were no outstanding
    amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our
    U.S. short-term borrowings outstanding was
    $204.5 million during fiscal 2007, $566.5 million
    during fiscal 2006 and $5.0 million during fiscal 2005. The
    weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term
    borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007, 3.69% in fiscal 2006 and
    2.04% in fiscal 2005.

F-14

As of January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006 Winners
    had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating
    expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility.
    The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line
    for operating expenses was C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007,
    C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006 and C$6.8 million in
    fiscal 2005 and there were no amounts outstanding on either of
    these lines at the end of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. As of
    January 27, 2007, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling
    £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal
    2007 was £10.5 million and there were no outstanding
    borrowings on this credit line at January 27, 2007.

E. Financial Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage our cost of
    borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate Contracts:

In December 1999,
    prior to the issuance of the $200 million ten-year notes,
    TJX entered into a rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying
    treasury rate of notes. The cost of this agreement is being
    amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes and
    results in an effective fixed rate of 7.60% on these notes.
    During fiscal 2004, TJX entered into interest rate swaps on
    $100 million of the $200 million ten-year notes
    effectively converting the interest on that portion of the
    unsecured notes from fixed to a floating rate of interest
    indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate. The maturity dates of the
    interest rate swaps is the same as the maturity date of the
    underlying debt. Under these swaps, TJX pays a specified
    variable interest rate and receives the fixed rate applicable to
    the underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swaps is
    accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest
    expense accrued on the fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swaps
    are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt. The
    fair value of the contracts, excluding the net interest accrual,
    amounted to a liability of $4.4 million, $4.6 million
    and $2.9 million as of January 27, 2007,
    January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.
    The valuation of the swaps results in an offsetting fair value
    adjustment to the debt hedged; accordingly, long-term debt has
    been reduced by $4.4 million in fiscal 2007,
    $4.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $2.9 million in fiscal
    2005. The average effective interest rate, on the
    $100 million of the 7.45% unsecured notes to which the
    swaps apply, was approximately 9.42% in fiscal 2007, 8.30% in
    fiscal 2006 and 6.45% in fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2006, concurrent with the issuance of the
    C$235 million three-year note, TJX entered an interest rate
    swap on the principal amount of the note converting the interest
    on the note from floating to a fixed rate of interest at
    approximately 4.136%. The maturity date of the interest rate
    swap is January 2009, one year before the maturity date of the
    underlying debt. Under this swap, TJX pays a specified fixed
    interest rate and receives the floating rate applicable to the
    underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swaps is
    accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest
    expense accrued on the floating-rate debt. The interest rate
    swap is designated as cash flow hedge of the underlying debt.
    The fair value of the contract, excluding the net interest
    accrual, amounted to an asset of $699,000 (C$825,000) as of
    January 27, 2007 and an asset of $95,000 (C$110,000) at
    January 28, 2006. The valuation of the swap results in an
    offsetting adjustment to other comprehensive income. The average
    effective interest rate on the note to which the swap applies
    was approximately 4.48% in fiscal 2007.

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on firm U.S. dollar and Euro merchandise purchase
    commitments made by its foreign subsidiaries, T. K. Maxx (United
    Kingdom) and Winners (Canada). These commitments are typically
    six months or less in duration. The contracts outstanding at
    January 27, 2007 covered certain commitments for the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008. TJX elected not to apply hedge
    accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the fair
    value of these contracts resulted in income of $1.2 million
    in fiscal 2007, expense of $2.5 million in fiscal 2006 and
    income of $1.8 million in fiscal 2005. TJX also enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on certain foreign intercompany payables, primarily
    license fees, for which we elect not to apply hedge accounting
    rules. There were no such contracts outstanding at
    January 27, 2007. The change in fair value of these
    contracts resulted in expense of $54,000 in fiscal 2006 and
    income of $1.9 million in fiscal 2005. The gain or loss on
    these contracts is ultimately offset by a similar gain or loss
    on the underlying item being hedged.

TJX also enters into foreign currency forward and swap contracts
    in both Canadian dollars and British pound sterling and accounts
    for them as either a hedge of the net investment in and between
    our foreign subsidiaries or as a cash flow hedge of certain
    long-term intercompany debt. We apply hedge accounting to these
    hedge contracts of our investment in foreign operations, and
    changes in fair value of these contracts, as well as gains and
    losses upon settlement, are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, offsetting changes in the cumulative
    foreign translation adjustments of our foreign divisions. The
    change in fair value of the contracts designated as a hedge of
    our

F-15

investment in foreign operations resulted in a loss of
    $5.6 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2007, a gain
    of $15.0 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2006, and
    a gain of $3.8 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal
    2005. The change in the cumulative foreign currency translation
    adjustment resulted in a gain of $20.4 million, net of
    income taxes, in fiscal 2007, a loss of $32.6 million, net
    of income taxes, in fiscal 2006, and a loss of
    $10.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2005. Amounts
    included in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow
    hedges are reclassified to earnings as the currency exposure on
    the underlying intercompany debt impacts earnings. The net loss
    recognized in fiscal 2007 related to cash flow contracts was
    $5.0 million, net of income taxes. This amount was offset
    by a non-taxable gain of $4.6 million, related to the
    underlying exposure. The net loss recognized in fiscal 2006
    related to cash flow contracts was $13.8 million, net of
    income taxes. This amount was offset by a non-taxable gain of
    $22.5 million, related to the underlying exposure. The net
    loss recognized in fiscal 2005 related to cash flow contracts
    and related underlying activity was $13.9 million, net of
    income taxes. This amount was offset by a gain of
    $11.9 million, net of income taxes, related to the
    underlying exposure. On July 20, 2006 TJX determined that
    the C$355 million intercompany loan, due from Winners to
    TJX, would not be payable in the foreseeable future due to the
    capital and cash flow needs of Winners. As a result, the
    intercompany loan and the related currency swap were
    re-designated as a net investment in a foreign operation.
    Accordingly, future foreign currency gains or losses on the
    intercompany loan and gains or losses on the related currency
    swap, to the extent effective, will be recorded in other
    comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the currency
    swap resulted in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of
    $2.9 million in fiscal 2007.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
    as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
    intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
    these contracts are recorded in the statements of income and are
    offset by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same
    period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these
    contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the
    underlying item in the statement of income. The net impact on
    the income statement of hedging activity related to these
    intercompany payables was immaterial in fiscal 2007, income of
    $318,000 in fiscal 2006 and expense of $2.2 million in
    fiscal 2005.

The value of foreign currency exchange contracts relating to
    inventory commitments is reported in current earnings as a
    component of cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs. The income statement impact of all other derivative
    contracts and underlying exposures is reported as a component of
    selling, general and administrative expenses.

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and swap contracts
    require us to make payments of certain foreign currencies or
    U.S. dollars for receipt of Canadian dollars,
    U.S. dollars or Euros. All of these contracts, except the
    contracts relating to our investment in our foreign operations,
    mature during fiscal 2008. The British pound sterling investment
    hedges have maturities from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, the
    Canadian dollar investment hedge contracts and interest rate
    swap contracts have maturities from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2010.

The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
    agreements are major international financial institutions and
    the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize our
    exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by one of
    the counterparties. We do not require counterparties to maintain
    collateral for these contracts. We periodically monitor our
    position and the credit ratings of the counterparties and do not
    anticipate losses resulting from the nonperformance of these
    institutions.

F. Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
    continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
    and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
    with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
    more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
    fiscal 1996, had remaining terms ranging up to twenty-five years.

Leases for T.K. Maxx are generally for fifteen to twenty-five
    years with ten-year kick-out options. Many of the leases contain
    escalation clauses and early termination penalties. In addition,
    we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes
    and other operating expenses including, in some cases, rentals
    based on a percentage of sales which aggregated to approximately
    one-third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
    January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
    continuing operations as of January 27, 2007:

The capital lease commitment relates to a

addition to TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments
    commenced June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease
    asset and related obligation equal to the present value of the
    lease payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
    amounted to $837.6 million, $774.9 million, and
    $713.3 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
    reported

F-17

net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
    $9.0 million, $7.1 million, and $6.9 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; and sublease income
    was $3.0 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. The total
    net present value of TJX’s minimum operating lease
    obligations approximates $4,141 million as of
    January 27, 2007.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
    $43.8 million as of January 27, 2007 and
    $39.9 million as of January 28, 2006. Letters of
    credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

G. Stock Compensation Plans

In November 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which is
    a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R)
    supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95,
    “Statement of Cash Flows.”

We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the “modified
    retrospective” method. The modified retrospective method
    requires that compensation cost be recognized beginning with the
    effective date of SFAS No. 123 (January 1, 1995)
    (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R)
    for all share-based payments granted after the effective date
    and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123
    for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date
    of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the
    effective date.

When the tax deduction exceeds the compensation cost resulting
    from the exercise of options, a tax benefit is created. Prior to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we presented all such
    tax benefits as operating cash flows on our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires
    that cash flows resulting from such tax benefits be classified
    as financing cash flows. Accordingly $3.6 million of
    operating cash inflows in fiscal 2007 and $3.0 million of
    operating cash inflows in fiscal 2005 have been reclassified to
    cash inflows from financing activity. There were no such excess
    tax benefits in fiscal 2006.

The total compensation cost related to stock based compensation
    was $45.1 million net of income taxes of $24.7 million
    in fiscal 2007, $58.9 million net of income taxes of
    $32.3 million in fiscal 2006, and $60.1 million, net
    of income taxes of $40.0 million in fiscal 2005.

As of January 27, 2007, there was $82.2 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan.
    That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 1.3 years. The total fair value of shares vested
    in fiscal 2007 was $75.7 million.

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
    stock awards may be granted to its directors, officers and key
    employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
    shareholders, and all stock compensation awards are made under
    this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
    approval, provides for the issuance of up to 145.3 million
    shares with 22.2 million shares available for future grants
    as of January 27, 2007. TJX issues shares from previously
    authorized but unissued common stock. On December 6, 2005,
    the Board of Directors of TJX determined that beginning in
    fiscal 2007, non-employee directors would no longer be awarded
    stock option grants under the Stock Incentive Plan, and the plan
    was amended to eliminate such awards.

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, TJX has granted options for the
    purchase of common stock, generally within ten years from the
    grant date at option prices of 100% of market price on the grant
    date. Most options outstanding vest over a three-year period
    starting one year after the grant, and are exercisable in their
    entirety three years after the grant date. Options granted to
    directors, prior to the amendment eliminating such awards,
    became fully exercisable one year after the date of grant.

For purposes of applying the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R), the fair
    value of each option granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied
    volatility from traded options on our stock, and historical
    volatility during a term approximating the expected term of the
    option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
    exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation
    model. Separate employee groups and option characteristics are
    considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected
    option life represents an estimate of the period of time options
    are expected to remain outstanding based upon historical
    exercise trends. The risk free rate is for periods within the
    contractual life of the option based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

Restricted
    Stock Pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan:

TJX
    has also issued restricted stock and performance-based stock
    awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. Restricted stock awards
    are issued at no cost to the recipient of the award, and have
    service restrictions that generally lapse over three to four
    years from date of grant. Performance-based shares have
    restrictions that generally lapse over one to four years when
    and if specified performance criteria are met. The grant date
    fair value of the award is charged to income ratably over the
    period during which these awards vest. The fair value of the
    awards is determined at date of grant and assumes that
    performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met,
    no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized
    compensation cost is reversed.

A combined total of 236,000 shares, 377,000 shares and
    220,000 shares for restricted and performance-based awards
    were issued in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 7,125
    and 18,750 shares were forfeited during fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. No shares were forfeited during fiscal 2005.
    The weighted average market value per share of these stock
    awards at grant date was $27.16 for fiscal 2007, $21.14 for
    fiscal 2006 and $22.37 for fiscal 2005.

In November 2005, we issued a market based deferred share award
    to our acting chief executive officer which is indexed to our
    stock price for the

sixty-day

period beginning February 22, 2007 (“measurement
    period”) whereby the executive can earn up to
    94,000 shares of TJX stock. The weighted average grant date
    fair value of this award was $9.90 per share.

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under
    the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are awarded two
    annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX
    common stock valued at $50,000. One award vests immediately and
    is payable with accumulated dividends in stock at the earlier of
    separation from service as a director or change of control. The
    second award vests based on service as a director until the
    annual meeting next following the award and is payable with
    accumulated dividends in stock at vesting date, unless an
    irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at
    the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2007,
    a total of 109,094 deferred shares had been granted under the
    plan. Actual shares will be issued at termination of service or
    a change of control.

H. Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

During fiscal 2005, we
    completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program begun in
    fiscal 2003 and initiated another multi-year $1 billion
    stock repurchase program. This repurchase program was completed
    in January 2006. In October 2005, our Board of Directors
    approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may
    repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of common stock.
    We had cash expenditures under our repurchase programs of
    $557.2 million, $603.7 million and $594.6 million
    in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, funded primarily by
    cash generated from operations. The total common shares
    repurchased amounted to 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007,
    25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 25.1 million
    shares in fiscal 2005. As of January 27, 2007, we have
    repurchased 22.3 million shares of our common stock at a
    cost of $563.8 million under the current $1 billion
    stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased under our stock
    repurchase programs have been retired. In January 2007, our
    Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that
    authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common
    stock from time to time, which is in addition to the
    $436.2 million remaining under our existing $1 billion
    authorization at January 27, 2007.

TJX has authorization to issue up to 5 million shares of
    preferred stock, par value $1. There was no preferred stock
    issued or outstanding at January 27, 2007.

Earnings Per Share:

In October 2004, the
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) reached a
    consensus that EITF Issue

No. 04-08,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
    Earnings per Share” would be effective for reporting
    periods ending after December 15, 2004. This accounting
    pronouncement affects the company’s treatment for earnings
    per share purposes of its $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001. The
    notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of TJX
    common stock if the sale price of our stock reaches certain
    levels or other contingencies are met. Prior to this reporting
    period, the 16.9 million shares were excluded from the
    diluted earnings per share calculation because criteria for
    conversion had not been met. EITF Issue

No. 04-08

requires that shares associated with contingently convertible
    debt be included in diluted earnings per share computations
    regardless of whether contingent conversion conditions have been
    met. EITF Issue

No. 04-08

also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior
    periods be adjusted to reflect this change. As a result, diluted
    earnings per share for all periods presented reflect the assumed
    conversion of our convertible subordinated notes.

    would have an antidilutive effect. There were 5.7 million
    and 190,800 such options excluded as of January 27, 2007
    and January 28, 2006, respectively. No such options were
    excluded as of January 29, 2005.

The fiscal 2007 total net deferred tax asset is presented on the
    balance sheet as a current asset of $35.8 million and a
    non-current liability of $21.5 million. For fiscal 2006,
    the net deferred tax asset is presented on the balance sheet as
    a current asset of $9.2 million and a non-current asset of
    $6.4 million. TJX has provided for deferred U.S. taxes
    on all undistributed earnings from its Canadian subsidiary
    through January 27, 2007. All earnings of TJX’s other
    foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested and no deferred
    taxes have been provided on those earnings. The net deferred tax
    asset summarized above includes deferred taxes relating to
    temporary differences at our foreign operations and amounted to
    $26.6 million net liability as of January 27, 2007 and
    $22.1 million net liability as of January 28, 2006.

Tax legislation enacted in 2004 allowed companies to repatriate
    the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations in fiscal
    2006 at an effective U.S. federal income tax rate of 5.25%.
    TJX recognized a one-time tax benefit of $47 million, or
    $0.10 per share, from the repatriation of
    U.S. $259.5 million of Canadian earnings during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, TJX corrected its accounting for the tax
    impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans.
    We had previously established a deferred tax liability on these
    gains, which are not taxable. The impact of correcting the tax
    treatment of these gains resulted in a tax benefit of
    $22 million. The cumulative impact of this adjustment
    through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was
    $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million,
    $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005.

TJX’s HomeGoods subsidiary has a net operating loss
    carryforward related to Puerto Rico of approximately
    $1.1 million that may be applied against future taxable
    income of its HomeGoods operations in Puerto Rico. The future
    tax benefit of this loss carryforward, which expires in fiscal
    2014, has not been recognized. In fiscal 2006, TJX utilized a
    United Kingdom net operating loss carryforward of approximately
    $2.4 million. As of January 27, 2007 and
    January 28, 2006, there was no United Kingdom net operating
    loss carryforward.

F-22

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 37.7% for
    fiscal 2007, 31.6% for fiscal 2006 and 38.3% for fiscal 2005.

J. Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit
    retirement plan covering the majority of its full-time
    U.S. employees. Employees who have attained twenty-one
    years of age and have completed one year of service are covered
    under the plan. No employee contributions are required and
    benefits are based on compensation earned in each year of
    service. New employees after February 1, 2006 do not
    participate in this plan but are eligible to receive enhanced
    employer contributions to their 401(k) plans. This plan
    amendment did not have an impact on fiscal 2007 pension expense,
    but is expected to result in savings in future years. Our funded
    defined benefit retirement plan assets are invested primarily in
    stock and bonds of U.S. corporations excluding TJX, as well
    as various investment funds. We also have an unfunded
    supplemental retirement plan which covers key employees of the
    Company and provides for certain employees additional retirement
    benefits based on average compensation.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
    funded defined benefit retirement plan (funded plan) and its
    unfunded supplemental pension plan (unfunded plan) for the
    fiscal years indicated. The valuation date for both plans is as
    of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end date:

The consolidated balance sheet as of January 27, 2007
    reflects the funded status of the plans after initial adoption
    of SFAS No. 158 whereby unrecognized prior service
    cost and actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). The combined net accrued
    liability of $60.1 million at January 27, 2007 is
    reflected on the balance sheet as a current liability of
    $3.4 million and a long term liability of
    $56.7 million.

As of January 28, 2006, the net asset attributable to the
    funded plan is reflected on the balance sheet as a non-current
    asset of $25.6 million and a current asset of
    $38.5 million and the net accrued liability attributable to
    TJX’s unfunded supplemental retirement plan of
    $55.9 million is included in other long-term liabilities.

The estimated prior service cost and net actuarial loss that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2008 is $57,000
    for the funded plan and $1.2 million for the unfunded plan.

We made aggregate cash contributions of $7.4 million,
    $42.0 million and $27.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, to the defined benefit retirement plan
    and to fund current benefit and expense payments under the
    unfunded supplemental retirement plan. The cash contribution in
    fiscal 2007 was solely to fund current benefit and expense
    payments under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. Our
    funding policy for our funded plan is to

F-24

fund any required contribution to the plan at the full funding
    limitation and generally to fund contributions in excess of any
    required contribution so as to fully fund the accumulated
    benefit obligation to the extent such contribution is allowed
    for tax purposes. As a result of voluntary funding contributions
    made in fiscal 2006 and prior years, there was no required
    funding in fiscal 2007 and we do not anticipate any funding
    requirements for fiscal 2008. The following is a summary of our
    target allocation for plan assets along with the actual
    allocation of plan assets as of the valuation date for the
    fiscal years presented:

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments is used to seek to
    maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent
    level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful
    consideration of plan liabilities, funded plan status, and
    corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio contains
    a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
    Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks,

as well as stocks of companies with small and large
    capitalizations. Both actively managed and passively invested
    portfolios may be utilized for U.S. equity investments.
    Other assets such as real estate funds, private equity funds,
    and hedge funds are currently used for their diversification and
    return enhancing characteristics. Derivatives may be used to
    reduce market exposure however, derivatives may not be used to
    leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
    investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews,
    annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
    studies.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term
    rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied,
    and long-term historical relationships between equities and
    fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted
    capital market principle that assets with higher volatility
    generate a greater return over the long term. Current market
    factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated
    before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
    Consideration is also given to asset class diversification and
    rebalancing as well as to the expected returns likely to be
    earned over the life of the plan by each category of plan
    assets. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed for
    reasonability and appropriateness.

In addition to net periodic pension cost TJX incurred special
    termination benefits of $664,000 in the funded plan and $247,000
    in the unfunded plan related to a reduction in workforce during
    fiscal 2007.

F-25

The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
    projected benefit obligation are amortized over the average
    remaining service life of participants. In addition, for the
    unfunded plan, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that
    exceed 30% of the projected benefit obligation are fully
    recognized in net periodic pension cost.

Following is a schedule of the benefits expected to be paid in
    each of the next five fiscal years and in the aggregate for the
    five fiscal years thereafter:

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
    eligible U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, assets under the plan totaled $633.8 million and
    $567.6 million, respectively, and are invested in a variety
    of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay,
    subject to limitation. TJX matches employee contributions, up to
    5% of eligible pay, at rates ranging from 25% to 50%, based upon
    the Company’s performance. Employees hired after
    February 1, 2006 will be eligible for participation in the
    plan with an enhanced matching formula beginning five years
    after hire date. TJX contributed $11.4 million in fiscal
    2007, $7.9 million in fiscal 2006 and $8.1 million in
    fiscal 2005 to the 401(k) plan. Employees cannot invest their
    contributions in the TJX stock fund option in the 401(k) plan,
    and may elect to invest up to only 50% of the Company’s
    contribution in the TJX stock fund. The TJX stock fund has no
    other trading restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents 3.8%,
    3.5% and 4.3% of plan investments at December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

During fiscal 1999, TJX established a nonqualified savings plan
    for certain U.S. employees. TJX matches employee
    contributions at various rates which amounted to
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2007, $313,000 in fiscal 2006, and
    $274,000 in fiscal 2005. TJX transfers employee withholdings and
    the related company match to a separate trust designated to fund
    the future obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in
    a variety of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the
    balance sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
    retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
    our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed for these plans
    $3.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
    medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
    in our retirement plan and who retire at age 55 or older
    with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
    associates and modified the benefit to current retirees enrolled
    in the plan. The plan amendment replaces the previous medical
    benefits with a defined amount (up to $35.00 per month)
    that approximates the retirees cost of enrollment in the
    Medicare Plan.

F-26

The valuation date for the unfunded postretirement medical plan
    obligation is as of December 31 prior to the fiscal year
    end date. Presented below is certain financial information

The unrecognized prior service credit is a result of the
    amendment to plan benefits in fiscal 2006 and results in a
    negative plan amendment of $46.9 million which will be
    amortized into income over the average remaining life (estimated
    at 13.9 years) of the active participants. Medical
    inflation is no longer a factor in determining the value of this
    obligation.

F-27

The estimated prior service credit that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    cost in fiscal 2008 is $3.8 million. The net actuarial loss
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2008 is
    $343,000.

As of January 27, 2007 the net accrued liability of the
    postretirement medical plan is reflected on the consolidated
    balance sheets as a non-current liability of $1.3 million
    and a current liability of $0.2 million. As of
    January 28, 2006 the net accrued liability of
    $43.4 million is included in non-current liabilities.

L. Discontinued Operations Reserve and Related Contingent
    Liabilities

We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued
    operations that relates primarily to real estate leases
    associated with 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to
    the consolidated financial statements) as well as leases of
    former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the
    activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below:

The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see
    Note C to our consolidated financial statements) resulted
    in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal
    2007. All other additions to the reserve are the result of
    periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our
    former businesses and are offset by income from creditor
    recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges
    against the reserve during each fiscal year relate primarily to
    our former businesses. The fixed asset write-offs and other
    charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 relate primarily to
    the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were
    closed at the end of fiscal 2007.

Approximately $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve
    balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our
    estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income.
    The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost
    of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are
    likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original
    lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after
    mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At
    January 27, 2007, substantially all the leases of the
    former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which
    the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved.
    The actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may
    differ from our initial estimate. Although TJX’s actual
    costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses
    may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur
    costs for leases from these former businesses that were not
    terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any
    material costs related to these discontinued operations in
    excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority
    of this reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which
    BJ’s Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for
    discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because
    we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX
    with respect to these leases is remote due to the current
    financial condition of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

F-29

M. Guarantees and Contingent Obligations

We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a
    lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
    without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
    have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
    guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
    exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed
    above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
    leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
    have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
    sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
    potential contingent obligations under them, which could be
    triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants
    does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of
    these leases.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note L to the
    consolidated financial statements, and properties of our
    discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants
    did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
    $105 million as of January 27, 2007. We believe that
    most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
    TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
    substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

N. Supplemental Cash Flows Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
    discontinued operations as discussed in Note L, are
    classified as a reduction in cash provided by continuing
    operations. There are no remaining operating activities relating
    to these operations.

TJX’s cash payments for interest and income taxes and

O. Segment Information

The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are managed on a
    combined basis and are reported as the Marmaxx segment. The
    Winners and HomeSense chains are also managed on a combined
    basis and operate stores exclusively in Canada. T.K. Maxx
    operates stores in the United Kingdom and the Republic of
    Ireland. Winners, HomeSense and T.K. Maxx accounted for 21%
    of TJX’s net sales for fiscal 2007, 21% of segment profit
    and 19% of all consolidated assets. All of our other chains
    operate stores exclusively in the United States with the
    exception of 14 stores operated in Puerto Rico by Marshalls
    which include 7 HomeGoods locations in a “Marshalls Mega
    Store” format. All of our stores, with the exception of
    HomeGoods, HomeSense and Bob’s Stores sell apparel for the
    entire family, including jewelry, accessories and footwear, with
    a limited offering of giftware and home fashions. The HomeGoods
    and HomeSense stores offer home fashions and home furnishings.
    Bob’s Stores is a value-oriented retailer of branded family
    apparel. By merchandise category, we derived approximately 63%
    of our sales from apparel (including footwear), 25% from home
    fashions and 12% from jewelry and accessories.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense and interest.
    “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not
    be

F-30

comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.
    In addition, this measure of performance should not be
    considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
    operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
    measure of liquidity.

A.J. Wright’s net sales and segment profit (loss) for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005 has been adjusted to reclassify the
    operating results of the 34 closed stores to discontinued
    operations. Identifiable assets and any balance sheet data in
    fiscal 2006 and 2005 have not been adjusted and include activity
    for all A.J. Wright stores.

A one-time, non-cash charge was recorded in the fiscal year
    ended January 29, 2005 to conform accounting policies with
    generally accepted accounting principles related to the timing
    of rent expense. This change resulted in a one-time, cumulative,
    non-cash adjustment of $30.7 million. See Note A at
    “Lease Accounting.”

(3)

General corporate expense for fiscal 2007 includes pre-tax costs
    associated with the Computer Intrusion ($5 million) and
    with a workforce reduction and other executive termination
    benefits ($5 million). General corporate expense for fiscal
    2006 includes pre-tax costs associated with executive
    resignation agreements ($9 million) and with exiting the

e-commerce

business of ($6 million).

(4)

Corporate identifiable assets consist primarily of cash, prepaid
    pension expense and a note receivable.

(5)

Includes debt discount and debt expense amortization.

P. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Presented below is selected quarterly consolidated financial
    data for fiscal 2007 and 2006 that was prepared on the same
    basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and
    includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein on a
