                                     ------

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the
United States and worldwide. We have positioned ourselves as a synergistic group
of off-price businesses and have expanded our off-price concept to new
geographic areas, new product lines and new demographic markets.

     We offer off-price family apparel and home fashions through our T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the United States, our Winners chain in
Canada and our T.K. Maxx chain primarily in the United Kingdom. We also operate
HomeGoods in the United States, a chain that focuses exclusively on off-price
home fashions, and we are opening a Canadian home fashions chain called
HomeSense in fiscal 2002. The target customer for all of our chains, except A.J.
Wright, is the middle to upper-middle income shopper with the same profile as a
department or specialty store customer. A.J. Wright targets a more moderate
income customer.

     Our mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and rapidly changing
assortment of brand-name merchandise at excellent values to our customers. We
define value as the combination of quality, fashion and price. With
approximately 300 buyers worldwide and over 9,000 vendors, we believe we are
well positioned to accomplish this goal. Our key strengths include:

- -    expertise in off-price buying;
- -    substantial buying power;
- -    relationships with many manufacturers; and
- -    inventory management systems and distribution networks.

     As an off-price retailer, we offer first-quality, in-season, name brand and
designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from
comparable department and specialty store regular prices. We can offer these
every day savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies, rapid
inventory turns and low expense structure.

     Due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace, we
are routinely able to buy excess merchandise from manufacturers and others at
significant discounts from initial wholesale prices. We purchase merchandise to
sell in the current selling season as well as a limited quantity of packaway
merchandise that is stored before sale in another selling season. We are willing
to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and
do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and markdown
allowances and return privileges. Our financial strength, strong reputation and
ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically diverse
network of stores gives us unparalleled access to many leading consumer brands.

     We rely heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory controls
that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores. For
example, highly automated storage and distribution systems track, allocate and
deliver an average of 12,000 items per week to each T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
store. In addition, specialized computer inventory planning, purchasing



and monitoring systems, coupled with warehouse storage, processing, handling
and shipping systems, permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of
store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment
requirements are determined centrally, using satellite-transmitted information
provided by point-of-sale computer terminals. This process is designed to
achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover and sell substantially all merchandise
within targeted selling periods.

     During the fiscal year ended January 27, 2001, we derived 90.0% of our
sales from the United States (31.4% from the Northeast, 16.6% from the Midwest,
27.9% from the South, 1.0% from the Central Plains, 13.1% from the West), 5.9%
from Canada and 4.1% from Europe (primarily the United Kingdom).

     Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of January 27,
2001. All references to store square footage are to gross square feet. Fiscal
2001 means the fiscal year ended January 27, 2001. Fiscal 2002 means the fiscal
year ending January 26, 2002. Our business is subject to seasonal influences,
which causes us generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the
second half of the year. This is common in the apparel retail business.

                             T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS
                             -----------------------

     T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retailer in the United States, with 661
stores in 47 states. Marshalls is the second-largest off-price retailer in the
United States, with 522 stores in 38 states as well as 13 stores in Puerto Rico.
We have successfully maintained the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls stores through merchandising, marketing and store appearance. This has
encouraged our customers to shop at both chains.

     T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices
generally 20%-60% below department and specialty store regular prices. Both
chains offer family apparel, accessories, giftware and domestics. While T.J.
Maxx also offers women's shoes and fine jewelry, Marshalls also offers a
full-line shoe department and a larger men's department. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
primarily target female customers who have families with middle to upper-middle
incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store
shopper.

     T.J. Maxx and Marshalls operate with a common buying and merchandising
organization and have consolidated administrative functions, including finance,
real estate, human resources and systems. The combined organization, known as
The Marmaxx Group, offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at
favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name merchandise at
substantial discounts from department and specialty store prices.

     T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community
shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average approximately 29,000 square feet.
Marshalls stores average approximately 31,000 square feet. We currently expect
to add a net of 75 stores in fiscal 2002. Ultimately, we believe that T.J. Maxx
and Marshalls together can operate approximately 1,800 stores in the United
States.




                                     WINNERS
                                     -------

     Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering off-price
designer and brand name women's apparel and shoes, lingerie, accessories,
domestics, giftware, menswear and children's clothing. In fiscal 2001, selected
stores added fine jewelry departments. Winners stores average approximately
27,000 square feet. Winners expects to add 15 stores in fiscal 2002. Ultimately,
we believe the Canadian market can support approximately 180 Winners stores.

     Winners anticipates opening our first seven HomeSense stores, in Canada, in
fiscal 2002. HomeSense, a concept dedicated to home fashions, capitalizes on the
wide customer acceptance of Winners as well as our strength in home product. We
believe that Canada could support 60 to 80 HomeSense stores in the long term.

                                    T.K. MAXX
                                    ---------

     T.K. Maxx is the only major off-price retailer in any European country.
T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and Winners and offers the same type of merchandise. The average size
of a T.K. Maxx store is approximately 26,000 square feet. T.K. Maxx opened 20
stores in fiscal 2001, ending the year with 74 stores in the United Kingdom,
Ireland and the Netherlands. Although our T.K. Maxx stores have performed
strongly in the U.K. and Ireland, our stores in the Netherlands have not met our
expectations. As a result, we will be closing our three Netherlands stores in
early fiscal 2002. This will allow T.K. Maxx to focus on growth in the U.K. and
Ireland. We currently expect to add a total of 30 stores in these countries in
fiscal 2002. We believe that the U.K. and Ireland can support approximately 250
stores in the long term. We also continue to see the European continent as a
viable longer-term growth opportunity for T.K. Maxx that could ultimately
support as many as 300 additional stores.

                                    HOMEGOODS
                                    ---------

     HomeGoods was the first off-price retail chain to focus exclusively on the
home fashions market. HomeGoods offers a broad array of giftware, accent
furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home. Many
of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores. We also combine HomeGoods stores
with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store in a superstore format that we call T.J.
Maxx 'N More or Marshalls Mega-Stores. Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average
approximately 30,000 square feet. In superstores, which average approximately
53,000 square feet, we dedicate approximately 22,000 square feet to HomeGoods.
The 81 stores open at year-end included 45 stand-alone stores and 36
superstores. In fiscal 2002, we anticipate adding a total of 30 HomeGoods
stores, including superstores. We believe that the U.S. market could support
approximately 500 freestanding HomeGoods stores and 150 superstores in the long
term.

                                   A.J. WRIGHT
                                   -----------

     A.J. Wright, a young chain launched in fiscal 1999, brings our off-price
concept to a different demographic customer, the moderate income shopper. A.J.
Wright stores offer branded family



apparel, accessories, shoes, domestics, giftware and special situation
purchases. We opened 10 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2001 and operated 25 stores
at fiscal year end. A.J. Wright stores average approximately 27,000 square feet.
We currently expect to open 20 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2002. We believe
this developing business offers us the long-term opportunity to open over 1,000
stores throughout the United States.




     We operated stores in the following locations as of January 27, 2001:

                                    ---------

     At January 27, 2001, we had approximately 77,000 employees, many of whom
work less than 40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

                                   COMPETITION
                                   -----------

     The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. Our
customers focus upon fashion, value, merchandise selection, brand name
recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. In general, we compete to
some degree with any retailer that sells apparel and home fashions. This
includes warehouse clubs, home fashion specialty stores, catalog operations, and
factory outlet stores. We primarily compete with local, regional and national
department stores, specialty stores and off-price chains. In addition, we
purchase much of our inventory opportunistically and compete for that
merchandise with other national and regional off-price apparel and outlet
stores. Many of our competitors handle identical or similar lines of merchandise
and have comparable locations.

     Various statements made in this annual report, including some of the
statements made under Item 1, "Business," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and

number of risks and uncertainties. All statements that address activities,
events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the future
are forward-looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:

- -    general economic conditions and consumer demand and preferences;

- -    weather patterns in areas where we have concentrations of stores;

- -    competitive factors, including pressure from pricing and promotional
     activities of competitors;

     store and distribution center locations on suitable terms;

- -    recruiting quality sales associates;

- -    the availability, selection and purchasing of attractive merchandise on
     favorable terms;




- -    potential disruptions in supply and duties, tariffs and quotas on imported
     merchandise, as well as economic and political problems in countries from
     which merchandise is imported;

- -    currency and exchange rate factors in foreign operations;

- -    expansion of our store base, development of new businesses and application
     of our off-price strategies in foreign countries; our acquisition and
     divestiture activities.

     We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking
statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected
results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

          TJX is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its
          investment in its Canadian (Winners) and European (T.K. Maxx)
          operations. As more fully described in the notes to the consolidated
          financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net
          investment and certain merchandise commitments in these operations
          with derivative financial instruments. TJX enters into derivative
          contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. TJX
          utilizes currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the
          gains or losses in the underlying exposures, most of which are
          recorded directly in shareholders' equity. The contracts are executed
          with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major
          industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
          assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates
          applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures
          described above. As of January 27, 2001 the analysis indicated that
          such market movements would not have a material effect on our
          consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
