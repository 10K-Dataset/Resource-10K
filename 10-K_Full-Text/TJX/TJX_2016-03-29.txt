CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K and our 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders contain “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, including some of the statements in this Form 10-K under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in our 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders under our letter to shareholders and our performance graphs. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and
potentially inaccurate assumptions. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have generally identified such statements by using words indicative of
the future such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “looking forward,” “may,” “plan,”
“potential,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will” and “would” or any variations of these words or other words with similar meanings. All statements that address activities, events or
developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or the Exchange Act. These “forward-looking statements” may relate to such matters as our future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and results
and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations expressed, anticipated or
implied in any forward-looking statement will be realized. The risks set forth under Item 1A of this Form 10-K describe major risks to our business. A variety of factors including these risks could cause our actual results and other
expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our forward-looking statements. Should known or unknown risks materialize, or should our underlying assumptions prove
inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement,
whether to reflect new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we may make in our future reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on our website, or otherwise.


PART I

ITEM 1. Business

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. Our over 3,600
stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.

Our stores are known for our value proposition of brand, fashion, price and quality. Our opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model
differentiate us from traditional retailers. We offer a treasure hunt shopping experience and a rapid turn of inventories relative to traditional retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and encourage
frequent customer visits. We acquire merchandise in a variety of ways to support that goal. We reach a broad range of customers across many income levels and other demographic groups with our value proposition. Our strategies and operations are
synergistic across our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and to develop talent across our Company. We also leverage the
substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

Our Businesses.

We
operate our business in four major segments: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX International (formerly referred to as TJX Europe).

MARMAXX

:

Our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States
(referred to together as The Marmaxx Group or Marmaxx) are collectively the largest off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 2,163 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel
(including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through
different product assortment, including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The
Cube at Marshalls, as well as varying in-store initiatives. This differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. Our e-commerce website, tjmaxx.com, was launched in 2013.

HOMEGOODS

:

Our
HomeGoods chain, introduced in 1992, is the leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 526 stores, HomeGoods offers a broad array of home fashions, including home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall
décor, seasonal items, decorative accessories from around the world and other merchandise.

TJX CANADA:

Our TJX Canada segment operates the Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in Canada. Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading off-price apparel
and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at its 245 stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx, with select stores offering fine jewelry and The Runway, a designer section. We opened our HomeSense chain in 2001, bringing
the home fashions off-price concept to Canada. HomeSense has 101 stores with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods. We brought Marshalls to Canada in 2011 and operate 41 Marshalls stores in Canada. As with Marshalls in the U.S.,
our Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear department and The Cube juniors’ department, differentiating them from Winners stores.


TJX INTERNATIONAL:

Our TJX International segment operates the T.K. Maxx and HomeSense chains in Europe and starting in late 2015, the Trade Secret chain in Australia. Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced off-price retail to Europe
and remains Europe’s only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 456 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. Through its stores and its e-commerce
website for the U.K., tkmaxx.com, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx. We brought the off-price home fashions concept to Europe, opening HomeSense in the U.K. in 2008. Its 39 stores in the U.K. offer a merchandise mix of home
fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. We acquired Trade Secret in the fall of 2015. The merchandise offering at its 35 stores in Australia is comparable to T.J. Maxx.

In addition to our four major segments, we operate Sierra Trading Post, acquired in 2012, a leading off-price Internet retailer of brand name and
quality outdoor gear, family apparel and footwear, sporting goods and home fashions. Sierra Trading Post launched its e-commerce site, sierratradingpost.com, in 1998 and operates eight retail stores in the U.S.

Flexible Business Model.

Our flexible off-price business model, including our opportunistic buying, inventory
management, logistics and store layouts, is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable, quality, brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day. Our buying and inventory management strategies
give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our merchants have more visibility into consumer,
fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free of permanent
fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick, efficient and differentiated
delivery of merchandise to our stores, with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times.

Opportunistic Buying.

As an off-price retailer, our buying practices, which we refer to as opportunistic buying,
differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer and other quality merchandise in our stores
at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores. We seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end. Our buying organization, which numbers
more than 1,000 Associates in 15 buying offices in 11 countries, executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.

We take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of
inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace. These opportunities include, among others, order cancellations, manufacturer overruns, closeouts and special production direct from brands and factories. Our buying strategies are intentionally
flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it. Our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to
give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. In contrast to traditional retailers, which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor, our
merchants generally remain in the marketplace throughout the year, frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise. We buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season. We also buy some merchandise that is
available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale, typically in future selling seasons. We generally make these purchases, referred to as packaway, in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe
has the right combination of brand, fashion, price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons. We also acquire some merchandise that we offer under in-house brands or brands that are
licensed to us. We develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of, or fill gaps in, our expected merchandise assortment.


Our expansive vendor universe, which is in excess of 18,000, consists primarily of manufacturers along
with retailers and other vendors, and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments
and expect this will continue as we continue to grow. We believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market. We are typically
willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets;
we pay promptly; we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges; and we have
financial strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.

We offer our customers a rapidly changing
selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions
at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local
preferences and demographics, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally,
using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to
operate with low inventory levels, to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store.

Pricing.

Our mission is to offer quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty
store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our
pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles.

Low Cost Operations.

We operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively
on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products, including at times promoting multiple banners together, which contributes to our advertising budget (as a
percentage of sales) remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our
distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.

Customer Service/Shopping Experience.

We continue
to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. Although we offer a self-service format, we train our store Associates to provide friendly and helpful customer
service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. We also offer TJX-branded
credit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.

Distribution.

We operate
distribution centers encompassing approximately 14 million square feet in six countries. These centers are generally large, highly automated and built to suit our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise
to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties.


Store Growth.

Expansion of our business through the addition of new stores
continues to be an important part of our growth strategy. The following table provides information on the store growth of our four major segments in the last two fiscal years, our growth estimates for fiscal 2017 and our estimates of the store
growth potential of these segments in their current geographies:

(1)

consolidated financial statements.

Segment Overview.

We report our results in four main business segments.
Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com
in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. We also operate Sierra Trading Post (STP), an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores in the U.S. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment. Each of our segments has its own
management, administrative, buying and merchandising organization and distribution network. More detailed information about our segments, including financial information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be found in Note G to the
consolidated financial statements.

Competition.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. We compete on the
basis of factors including brand, fashion, price, quality, selection and freshness; in-store service and shopping experience; reputation and store location. We compete with local, regional, national and international department, specialty,
off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through catalogues, on-line or other media.

Employees.

At January 30, 2016, we had approximately 216,000 employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per week.
In addition, we hire temporary employees, particularly during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

Trademarks.

We
have the right to use our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, Sierra Trading Post and Trade Secret, in relevant countries. We expect our rights in these trademarks and
service marks to endure in locations where we use them for as long as we continue to do so.

Seasonality.

Our business is
subject to seasonal influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales and income.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

The statements in this section
describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully, in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks that follow, individually or in the aggregate, are those that we
think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements.

Failure to execute our
opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our business.

While opportunistic buying, operating
with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our off-price business strategy, they subject us to risks related to the pricing, quantity, mix, nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores. Our merchants are in
the marketplace frequently, as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season, and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them. Our business model expects them to react to frequently
changing opportunities and trends in the market, assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it. If we do not obtain the right fresh, desirable merchandise at
the right times, quantities and prices, or the right mix of merchandise, it could adversely affect customer traffic as well as our sales and margins.

We base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or
slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins, or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales, either of which could adversely affect our financial performance.

If we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers, we may not be able to maintain
an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores, and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected. We may not achieve this at various times or in some segments, chains or geographies,
which could adversely affect our results.

We must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of delivering the right
product to the right stores at the right time. We need to appropriately allocate merchandise among our stores, timely and efficiently distribute inventory to stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, appropriately
change the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns. If we are not able to do so, our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be
adversely affected.

In addition to our own execution, we may need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our
control, discussed further below, such as adverse weather and natural disasters or changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain, such as political instability; labor issues, including port labor disputes, strikes or
threats of strikes; or increasing cost of compliance with regulations. If we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors, our inventory management may be affected, which could impact our performance and our relationship with our customers.

Failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely
affect our financial results.

Our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our off-price model within our current markets and
into new geographic regions, product lines, businesses and channels and, as appropriate, adding new businesses, whether by development, investment or acquisition. There are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand
successfully, including managing the implementation of this growth effectively. If any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect, in whole or in part, we may be required to


increase our investment, slow our planned growth or close stores or operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. For example, successful store growth requires us to find
and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores. Our ability to do so depends, among other things, on availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies; degree of
competition for sites; factors affecting costs such as real estate, construction and development costs and costs and availability of capital; and variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations. If we cannot lease appropriate sites
on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets. There are risks in entering new markets, including those detailed further below. New stores
may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores, whether in current or new markets, and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect our sales and profitability.

Further, our substantial size may add operational complexity and imposes demands on maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party
providers to support our business effectively. These demands may increase as we grow our business, adding pressure to management and various functions across our business, including administration, merchandising, store operations, distribution and
compliance, and on appropriately staffing and training personnel in these areas as we grow. The large size and scale of our operations, our multiple chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe and our new chain in Australia and the autonomy afforded to
the chains in some aspects of the business increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies will not be implemented effectively throughout our Company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations.
These risks may increase as we continue to grow, particularly as we expand into additional countries. If business information is not shared effectively, or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively, we may operate with
decreased operational efficiency, may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets, which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our
sales and results.

Failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could
negatively impact our performance.

Because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand, we work to identify customer
trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences. However, doing so on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and
Australia in which we do business is challenging. Trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate. Although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and
trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes, we may not successfully do so, which could add difficulty in successfully entering new markets, attracting new customers, retaining existing
customers, encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results.

Customers may also have expectations about how they shop in
stores or through e-commerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media (through Internet-based and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media), which may vary across demographics and may
evolve rapidly. Meeting demand effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed, among other things, and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial
results.

If we fail to successfully implement our

various marketing efforts or if our competitors are more effective with their
programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected.

Customer traffic and demand for our
merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts, the name recognition and reputation of our chains and the location of and service offered in our stores. Although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including
television, social media, database marketing, mobile marketing, print and direct marketing, some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive
advantage. Internet-based and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media rapidly evolve. Our programs


may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.

We operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to compete effectively.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. We compete with local, regional, national and international retailers that sell
apparel, home fashions and other merchandise we sell, including in stores, through e-commerce, catalogues or other media. Some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do. New
competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate, expand their merchandise offerings, add new sales channels or change their pricing methods, all of which increase
competition for customers. We compete on the basis of value, meaning a combination of brand, fashion, price, quality; merchandise selection and freshness; brand name recognition; customer service; reputation and store location. Our competitiveness
is highly dependent on our effective execution of our off-price model of offering our customers a fresh, rapidly changing and attractive mix of merchandise delivering value. If we fail to compete effectively, our sales and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Failure to attract, train and retain quality Associates in appropriate numbers, including key Associates and
management, could adversely affect our performance.

Our performance depends on recruiting, developing, training and retaining
quality sales, systems, distribution center and other Associates in large numbers as well as experienced Associates in key areas such as buying and management. Many of our Associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high
rates of turnover. Availability and skill of Associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter, and we need to manage our labor needs effectively. In addition, because of the distinctive nature of our off-price
model, we must provide significant internal training and development for key Associates across the company, including within our buying organization. Similar to other retailers, we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in
management and other key areas for many reasons, including competition in the retail industry generally and for talent in various geographic markets. If we do not continue to attract qualified individuals, train them in our business model, support
their development and retain them, our performance could be adversely affected or our growth could be limited.

Labor costs, including pension and
healthcare costs, and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability.

We have a large
workforce, and our ability to meet our labor needs is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels; prevailing wage rates and wage requirements; participant benefit levels; changing demographics; economic conditions; interest rate changes;
economic, demographic and other actuarial assumptions; health and other insurance costs and the regulatory environment, including health care legislation, immigration law, and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits programs and
requirements, each of which could increase our costs. Increased labor costs, including costs of providing retirement, health and other employment benefits may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, when wage rates or benefit levels
increase in a market, increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during fiscal 2016, while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits, could result in a decline in
our ability to attract or retain Associates or in the quality of our workforce, causing our customer service or performance to suffer, which could impact our results. Certain Associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore
subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential expenses associated with multiemployer plans, including from potential withdrawal liability and potential insolvency of other participating employers. Other
Associates are members of works councils, which may subject us to additional actions or expense. In addition, any failure of third parties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration, employment or other laws and regulations could
damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor.


Compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit certain information from individuals, such as our customers and
Associates, including, for example, customer payment card and check information. We rely in part on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of personal and/or
confidential information. As with many other companies, particularly in the retail industry, we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security. Computer hackers may, for example, attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of the
third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations and, if successful, misappropriate customer or Associate information or confidential business information of our company. While we have taken steps designed to further
strengthen the security of our computer system since the unauthorized intrusion(s) into our network discovered late in 2006, in which we believe customer data were stolen, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise,
that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect, store, process or transmit, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way. In addition, an Associate, contractor or third
party with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively, may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards or one of those parties may misuse the personal or confidential information
to which they have access, may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or, through error, inadvertently cause a breach involving, or otherwise disclose, such
information. Advances in computer and software technology and capabilities, rapid changes in the sources, methods and targets of cyber-attacks and other developments, including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally, may increase
the risk of such a breach.

Compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource
business operations, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations,
damage our reputation and decrease our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online, impact our ability to attract and retain customers, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs
and liabilities which could be material.

Failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our
business or reduce our sales or profitability.

We rely extensively on various information systems, including data centers, hardware
and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business, including to process and record transactions in our stores, to enable effective communication systems, to plan and track inventory flow, to manage logistics, to generate
performance and financial reports and to operate our e-commerce sites. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. Supporting these internal and external systems requires a
number of resources, including effective and qualified, and in some cases, specialized, teams. As we grow and as our systems evolve, we must continue to hire, train, manage and retain these teams, including to support our customized and legacy
systems, in an effective way. Our computer systems and the third-party systems we rely on are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses or
malware; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our Associates or contractors. Although we seek to maintain our
systems effectively, manage our team of internal and third party resources effectively and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity, security and consistent operations of our systems, we may not be successful in doing so.
Compromises, interruptions or shutdowns of our systems, including those managed by third parties, whether intentional or inadvertent, could lead to delays in our business operations and, if significant or extreme, affect our results of operations.
In addition, any interruption in the operation of our websites, particularly our e-commerce sites, could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such an
interruption.


We modify, update, and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time, including by adding
new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality, such as for cloud computing technologies and for
the continued operation and development of our e-commerce businesses; and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses. We also modify and change our procedures for, and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing,
implementing and maintaining our systems. Although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems, teams and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them, there are inherent risks
associated with modifying or replacing systems, with new or changed relationships and with changes from acquisitions, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes in a timely manner, realizing the
expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion to internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented. Further, potential issues associated with implementing technology
initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. The efficient operation and successful growth of our
business depends upon our information systems, including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively, to select appropriate internal teams and vendors to maintain or enhance them and to select and implement appropriate new technologies,
systems, controls, hardware, software and applications and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed, or our failure to implement and operate
them effectively, could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability.

Economic conditions, on a global level
or in particular markets, may adversely affect our financial performance.

Global financial markets can experience extreme
volatility, disruption and credit contraction, which adversely affect global economic conditions. Turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our
costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance, and increase our pension liabilities, expenses and funding requirements with respect to company-sponsored and multiemployer pension plans. Economic conditions,
both on a global level and in particular markets, including unemployment, decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth, energy and health care costs, interest and tax rates and policies, weakness in the housing market, volatility in
capital markets, decreased credit availability, inflation and deflation, as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war, terrorism, global or national unrest, actual or threatened epidemics, and
political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending. Consumer spending, in turn, affects retail sales. These conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and, although we
believe our flexible off-price model helps us react, they may adversely affect our sales, cash flows and results of operations and performance.

Adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or along our supply chain could adversely affect our operating results.

Both adverse and unseasonable weather, such as storms, severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures, affect customers’
buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all, and accordingly, can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise. Weather can also affect the ability to
transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our sales, increase markdowns and
adversely affect our operating results.

Our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events.

Unforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics, natural or other disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and
other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of
our stores or distribution


facilities located in the affected areas. Day-to-day operations, particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected, or
we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time. As a result, our business could be adversely affected.

As our business is subject to seasonal influences, a decrease in sales or margins, a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business
during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results.

Our business is subject
to seasonal influences. We generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday seasons. Any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during
this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.

Damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail
banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results.

We believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners
is important to our continuing success. In the many different markets in which we do business, we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns. These relationships and our reputation are based, in part, on
perceptions of subjective qualities, so incidents involving us, merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in
rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Similarly, information about us, our retail banners and the merchandise we sell, including our licensed or owned brands, publicized through traditional or social media platforms and
similar venues, including blogs, websites, and other forums for rapid, broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation and brand, even if the information is unverified or inaccurate.
The reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners in all, one or some of the markets in which we do business. Damage to the reputation of our company and our banners
could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales, affect our vendor relationships, development opportunities and Associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business.

Quality, safety or other issues with merchandise

we sell

could damage our reputation, sales and financial results.

Various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers.
Regulations and standards in this area, including those related to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, state regulations like California’s Proposition 65, and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate,
impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through e-commerce. These regulations change from time to time and new federal, state, provincial or local regulations in the U.S. and other countries that may affect
our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity. If we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all, or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or
new merchandise categories or in new geographies, significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We rely on
our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws, but they may not comply with their obligations to do so. Although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for
indemnification for product liabilities, the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise, particularly with food, bath and body and children’s
products, and issues with the genuineness of merchandise, or customer concerns about such issues, regardless of our fault, could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise
recalls and increased costs, and regulatory, civil or criminal fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.


Our expanding international operations may expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries.

We have a significant retail presence in Canada and in countries in Europe and have established buying offices around the world. We
have recently expanded our operations into additional markets in Europe and Australia and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other international markets in the future. It can be costly and complex to establish, develop and
maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions, which may differ significantly from the U.S. and other countries in which we currently operate. In addition to facing risks similar to our U.S. and current
international operations, such as with regulations like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there are additional risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries. These additional risks include, among
others, understanding the local retail climate and trends, local customs and cultures, seasonal differences, business practices and competitive conditions; complying with relevant laws, rules and regulations; developing the appropriate
infrastructure; and identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations. There are also financial, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations, including currency exchange
fluctuations; potentially adverse tax consequences; limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned; trade regulations; the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes; the risk of political, economic and
civil instability and labor unrest; and uncertainties regarding interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and agreements. Any of these risks could adversely impact our operations, profitability or liquidity. Complying with applicable
laws, rules and regulations and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls, conduct audits, train Associates and third parties on our compliance
methods or take other actions, any of which could adversely impact our operations.

We are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise
from other countries.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and, to a lesser extent, by us, in many
countries outside of the country where the stores are located, particularly southeastern Asia. Where we are the importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such
products. We are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from other countries and purchasing product made in other countries, such as:

—

potential disruptions in manufacturing, logistics and supply;

—

changes in duties, tariffs, trade restrictions, quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise;

—

transport capacity and costs;

—

information technology challenges;

—

problems in third-party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain;

—

strikes, threats of strikes and other events affecting delivery;

—

consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise;

—

product and international trade compliance with laws and regulations of the destination country;

—

compliance with laws and regulations including changing labor, environmental and other laws in those countries and those concerning ethical business practices,
such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;

—

product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled, defective or otherwise noncompliant or
alleged to be harmful;

—

exposure for product warranty and intellectual property issues;

—

concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in countries where merchandise is produced;

—

concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains;


—

currency exchange rates, financial or economic instability; and

—

political or other disruptions in countries from or through which merchandise is imported.

These and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of
our inventory. Furthermore, although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions and importing merchandise, there can be no assurance that
contractors, agents, vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our
reputation, operations or operating results.

Our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other
fuels, raw materials and other commodities.

Energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and, at times, have resulted in
significant cost increases, particularly for the price of oil and gasoline. An increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers.
Although we typically implement a hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs, that strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs. Increases in oil and gasoline prices could
also adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products. Increased operating costs and decreased consumer spending and demand for our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, either individually or in the
aggregate. Increased regulation related to environmental costs, including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business, including utility, transportation and logistics costs. Similarly,
other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically, such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics, which at times have risen significantly. Such increases can increase the cost of merchandise, which could adversely affect our performance through
potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings.

Sales made by our stores outside the United States are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and
changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Because of this, movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue
to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time. Changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the
business buying the merchandise. When exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period, as they did in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively, it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices
accordingly, and gross margin can be adversely affected. In addition, a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in China and accordingly, a revaluation of Chinese currency, or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for
that currency, increasing its value relative to the U.S. dollar or currencies in which our stores are located, could be significant.

Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise
margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make mark-to-market adjustments at the end of each
accounting period. These adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings.

Although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows
associated with changes in currency exchange rates, we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange
rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform.


Our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods, our projections or the expectations
of securities analysts or investors, which could adversely affect our stock price.

Our operating results have fluctuated from
quarter to quarter at points in the past, and they may do so in the future. If we fail to increase our results over prior periods, to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may
decline, and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance. Results may be affected by various factors, including those described in these risk factors. We maintain a forecasting process that
seeks to project sales and align expenses. If we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results, or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast, our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition,
if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, our earnings per share may be adversely affected.

If we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses, or divest, close or consolidate any of our current businesses, our business will be
subject to additional risks.

We may acquire new businesses (as we did with Trade Secret in fiscal 2016 and STP in fiscal 2013),
invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses, develop new businesses internally and divest, close or consolidate businesses. Failure to execute on mergers, acquisitions, investments, divestitures, closings and consolidations in a
satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Acquisition, investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses, and we may not
effectively evaluate target companies, investments or investment partners or assess the risks, benefits and cost of buying, investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses, all of which can be difficult,
time-consuming and dilutive. These activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greater-than-expected costs, liabilities and risks. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from
acquisitions, we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Divestitures, closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs
and obligations of closure, including exposure on leases, owned real estate and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent
failure of an acquirer.

Failure to comply with existing laws, regulations and orders or changes in existing laws, regulations and applicable
accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.

We are subject
to federal, state, provincial, regional and local laws, rules and regulations in the United States and other countries, any of which may change from time to time, as well as orders and assurances. These legal, regulatory and administrative
requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, from the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits, workforce management, logistics, marketing, import/export, sourcing and manufacturing, data protection and others. If
we fail to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and orders, we may be subject to judgments, fines or other costs or penalties, which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition.

We must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations, new regulatory initiatives, evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and
regulatory authorities, and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business. These changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results, including those involving:

—

labor and employment benefits, including regarding labor unions and works councils;

—

health and welfare and financial regulations;

—

consumer protection and product safety;

—

data protection and privacy;

—

climate change, supply chain, energy and waste;


—

Internet regulations, including e-commerce, electronic communications and privacy; and

—

protection of third party intellectual property rights.

Further, applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition.

Our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation, legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters.

We are involved, or may in the future become involved, in legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, audits and other legal matters. These may involve
inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and other proceedings by local, provincial, state and federal governmental entities (in the United States and other countries) and private plaintiffs, including with respect to tax, escheat, whistleblower claims,
employment and employee benefits including classification, employment rights, discrimination, wage and hour and retaliation, securities, disclosure, real estate, tort, consumer protection, privacy/data security, product safety, advertising, and
intellectual property. There continue to be a number of employment-related and consumer protection lawsuits, including putative class actions, in the United States, and we are subject to these types of suits. We cannot predict the results of legal
and regulatory proceedings with certainty, and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome. Regardless of merit or outcome, litigation can be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and may
cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs, fines, penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for
monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees and/or require us to change aspects of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could
be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher
statutory income tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes in transfer pricing, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in applicable tax legislation, regulations and treaties, exposure to additional tax
liabilities, including interest and penalties, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. Significant
judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes, and actual results may differ from our estimations.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal, state, provincial and local tax authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries, and the examining authorities may
challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various proceedings, which are at various stages, with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to
determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes, and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments. However, the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or
settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts, law or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such
proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner, which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to
tax audits and examinations for payroll, value added, sales-based and other taxes relating to our businesses.

Our real estate leases generally
obligate us for long periods, which subjects us to financial risks.

We lease virtually all of our store locations, generally for an
initial term of 10 years, with options to renew the term, in the U.S. and Canada or an initial term of 10 to 15 years in Europe. In addition, we either own or lease for


long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate, which can adversely affect our
results as, for example, was the case in the closures of various of our former operations. While we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions, including by making specified payments, we may not be able to terminate a
particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases, which generally include, among other things, paying rent and operating
expenses for the balance of the lease term, or paying to exercise rights to terminate, and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive. When we assign leases or sublease space to third parties, we can remain liable on the lease
obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform. In addition, when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause
us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms.

We depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply
capital to fund our operations, growth, stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment.

Our business depends upon
our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities, to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends, and to pay our
interest and debt repayments. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans
and financial performance including our earnings per share. We borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed, it could also adversely affect our
financial performance.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2. Properties

We lease virtually all of our over 3,600 store locations, generally for an initial term of 10 years with options to extend the lease term for one or more 5-year periods in the U.S. and Canada, and an initial
term of 10 to 15 years in Europe, some of which have options to extend. We have the right to terminate some of these leases before the expiration date under specified circumstances and some with specified payments.

OVERVIEW

We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below
department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,600 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada
(which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International, formerly TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and Trade Secret in Australia). In the U.S. we also operate Sierra Trading Post
(STP), a leading off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment.

Fiscal 2016 was another successful year for TJX as we posted strong gains in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong
increases in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new
stores and remodeling existing ones, and while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth. In fiscal 2016, we implemented the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for our U.S. full- and part-time hourly
store associates. The second phase of additional wage increases will occur in fiscal 2017.

Highlights of our financial performance for
fiscal 2016 include the following:

—

Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2016 over an increase of 2% in fiscal 2015 and an increase of 3% in fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2016 increase was driven by
an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket.

—

Net sales increased to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2016, up 6% over the same period last year. Net sales increased to $29.1 billion for fiscal 2015, up 6% over the
prior year. At January 30, 2016, the number of stores in operation increased 6% and selling square footage increased 5% over the end of fiscal 2015.

—

Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 were $3.33 per diluted share compared to $3.15 per diluted share in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2015 earnings per share includes a
charge of $0.01 from a loss on early extinguishment of debt.

—

Our fiscal 2016 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 11.8%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease compared to our fiscal 2015 pre-tax margin.
The loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced pre-tax margin by 0.1 percentage point in fiscal 2015.

—

Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2016 was 71.2%, a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared to the fiscal 2015 ratio. This improvement was driven by buying and
occupancy expense leverage on strong same store sales growth as well as an increase in merchandise margin.

—

Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2016 increased 0.7 percentage points to 16.8% from 16.1% in fiscal 2015. This increase is
primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to our wage initiative and the impact of handling a large increase in units sold.

—

Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our
e-commerce businesses, were up 5% (up 6% on a constant currency basis) at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year.

—

During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 26.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.8 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase
program. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized our 17

th

stock
repurchase program for an additional $2.0 billion.


The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating
results.

Net sales:

Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over $29.1 billion in
fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 5% increase from same store sales, offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses amount to approximately 1% of
total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2016 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $29.1 billion, a 6% increase over $27.4 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 2%
increase from same store sales. Foreign currency exchange rates and e-commerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth.

Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2016,
home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same
store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was slightly below the consolidated average.

Same
store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic. In fiscal 2015, within apparel, sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well,
as did home fashions. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest. Same store sales increases at TJX International and TJX Canada were above the consolidated average.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other
words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. The sales of Sierra Trading Post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com (our e-commerce businesses) are not included in same store sales. We classify a store as a new store
until it meets the same store sales criteria. The newly acquired Trade Secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated
stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign
segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange
rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average
retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation.


The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales:

Impact
of foreign currency exchange rates

:

Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency
exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows:

—

Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars:

In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International
from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net
income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and
expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.

—

Inventory-related derivatives:

We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as
defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement
impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant
changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.

We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency.” This does not
include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates
on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange.”

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.2% in fiscal 2016 compared to 71.5% in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. The improvement in this expense ratio was driven by leverage on buying
and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase along with an increase on our profit margin on merchandise sold (merchandise margin). Together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5
percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for Canada and Europe this year versus last year. The change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise
purchased by Canada and Europe that were denominated in currencies other than their local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. This expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more
units through our supply chain and the mark to


market of inventory derivatives. The fiscal 2015 expense ratio was comparable to that of fiscal 2014 with a slight increase in the fiscal 2015 merchandise margin.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in
fiscal 2016, 16.1% in fiscal 2015 and 16.3% in fiscal 2014. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to our wage initiative and an increase in units handled at the stores,
along with our incremental investments and increased contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations.

The reduction in this ratio for
fiscal 2015 was largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015, as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt:

On July 8, 2014, we redeemed our $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due
August 2015 and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million.

Interest expense, net:

The
components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:

The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease
obligation related to TJX Canada’s new home office of $3.7 million. The increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in the fiscal 2016 periods as compared to the same periods last
year.

The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance (June 5, 2014) on the
$750 million 2.75% seven-year notes. In addition, fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the $500 million 2.50% ten-year notes, compared to fiscal 2014, which only reflected nine months of interest expense. These costs were partially
offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the $400 million 4.20% notes. The reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2016, 37.6% in fiscal 2015 and 35.6% in fiscal 2014. The
increase in the fiscal 2016 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. The increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily
due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately $80 million, which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing
authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for
more information relating to income taxes.

Net income and diluted earnings per share:

Net income was $2.3 billion in
fiscal 2016, a 3% increase over $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015, which in turn was a 4% increase over $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $3.33 in fiscal 2016, $3.15 in fiscal 2015 and $2.94 in fiscal 2014. The after-tax cost
for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.01 per share. The tax benefits referred to above added $0.11 to earnings per share for fiscal 2014. Foreign
currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.09 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015, and a $0.02 negative impact in fiscal 2015 when
compared to fiscal 2014.


Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited
our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2016 by approximately 3%. We repurchased 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015 and
27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014.

Segment information:

We operate four main
business segments. Our Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods segments both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates
T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. In the U.S., we also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. We currently consider all of STP, including its limited number of stores, as
part of our e-commerce businesses. The results of STP have been included in our Marmaxx segment. The former TJX Europe segment has been renamed TJX International to reflect the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia. We evaluate the performance of
our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the
term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of
performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.

Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments:

U.S. Segments:

Marmaxx

At January 30, 2016, STP operated eight stores with selling square footage of 159,000. At January 31, 2015, STP operated
six stores with selling square footage of 122,000. At February 1, 2014, STP operated four stores with selling square footage of 83,000.

Net sales at Marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 3% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 4% in
fiscal 2016 is on top of a 1% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was driven by an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was more than offset
by a decrease in the average ticket. Our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold. Geographically, same store
sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast region particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth.

Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 1% in fiscal 2015, on top of a 3% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal
2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight


increase in customer traffic. Same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average. Within apparel, jewelry and accessories
and activewear were well above the average. Geographically, same store sales increases were strongest in the Southeast and Southwest.

Segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 14.3% compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect an increase in merchandise margin
and occupancy expense leverage on same store sales growth of approximately 0.6 percentage points. However, these gains were offset by higher distribution costs, reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll, primarily
due to our wage initiative, and processing more units at the store level. In addition, tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) had a negative impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons of 0.3 percentage points. Our

e-commerce

businesses operate at lower profit margins and at STP, we incurred additional costs as we work to transition this business to be less promotional to align more closely with our off-price model and to
adjust its merchandise mix. Overall, e-commerce sales represent less than 2% of Marmaxx’s net sales.

Segment margin in fiscal 2015
was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2014. Improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our e-commerce businesses and expense deleverage,
primarily occupancy costs, on the 1% same store sales growth.

In fiscal 2017, we expect to open approximately 60 Marmaxx stores and
increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.

HomeGoods

HomeGoods’ net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2016, on top of a 14% increase in fiscal 2015. The increase in
fiscal 2016 reflected a 7% increase from new store sales and an 8% increase from same store sales. The same store sales increase of 8% in fiscal 2016 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2015. The increase in same store sales for
fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic.

Segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.0%, up from 13.6% for fiscal 2015. The growth in segment margin for fiscal 2016 was driven by expense
leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative. Segment profit
margin for fiscal 2015 was 13.6%, up from 12.9% for fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, due to buying and occupancy costs as well as administrative costs, and an increase in
merchandise margins.

In fiscal 2017, we plan an increase of approximately 50 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square
footage by approximately 8%.


Foreign Segments:

TJX Canada

Net sales for TJX Canada in fiscal 2016 were down 1% compared to fiscal 2015. While net sales reflected a 3%
increase from new store sales and a 12% increase from same store sales, these were more than offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 16%. The same store sales increase of 12% in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an
increase in customer traffic. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2015. Net sales for TJX Canada were essentially flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a 4% increase from new store sales and a 3% increase in same store sales were
completely offset by a 7% negative impact from foreign currency.

Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.1% in
fiscal 2016. The decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins, the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the above-plan
performance. Collectively, these items reduced segment margin by 1.2 percentage points. The decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased TJX
Canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars. These declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs.

Segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.6% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise
margins and the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives, which collectively reduced segment margin by 0.8 percentage points. The decline in merchandise margin in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was
also largely related to transactional foreign exchange. The decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs, along with a reduction in advertising costs
as a percentage of sales.

In fiscal 2017, we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in Canada and plan to increase selling square
footage by approximately 7%.


TJX International

Net sales for TJX International increased 3% in fiscal 2016 to $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2015,
on top of a 13% increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 10%. The
increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. Net sales for TJX International increased 13% in fiscal 2015 to $4.1 billion compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015
reflected an 8% increase from new store sales, a 3% increase from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Segment profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 7.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the
strong same stores sales increase, which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin. The investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our
business, investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans, our new store openings in Austria and the Netherlands and the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia.

Segment profit margin increased 0.6 percentage points to 8.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage
on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. The mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives also had a positive impact. These margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a
percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016.

We expect to add
approximately 50 stores to TJX International in fiscal 2017 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8%.

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the
operations of our business segments. Virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Increased contributions to the TJX charitable foundations, higher incentive


compensation accruals due to our above-plan performance and costs related to the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia accounted for approximately $61 million of the increase in general
corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

General corporate expense for fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior
year primarily due to a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. These reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in
stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the TJX Foundation.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,937 million in fiscal 2016, $3,008 million
in fiscal 2015 and $2,600 million in fiscal 2014. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by $71 million compared to fiscal 2015. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,894 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2,804 million
in fiscal 2015, an increase of $90 million. The change in the deferred income tax provision unfavorably impacted year-over-year cash flows by $71 million, which was driven by the deferred tax impact of the higher contributions to the pension plan in
fiscal 2015. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, negatively impacting
year-over-year cash flows by $243 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of
merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of $166
million in fiscal 2015. This favorable impact of $187 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional $100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to
fiscal 2016. Lastly, fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased $408 million compared to fiscal 2014. Net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided
cash of $2,804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $2,686 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $118 million. The change in the deferred income tax provision, which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension
plan of $150 million in fiscal 2015, favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by $50 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015,
compared to a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, favorably impacting year-over-year cash flows by $70 million. The cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of
merchandise purchases. The improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that was paid for in the following fiscal year. The change in
accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $30 million in fiscal 2014. This favorable impact of $51 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was
driven by a payment in fiscal 2015 of approximately $80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $122 million year-over-year due to the
change in income taxes payable and recoverable, which was largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision.


Investing activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below:

We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 will be approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $600
million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, approximately $300 million for store renovations and approximately $200 million for new stores. We plan to fund
these expenditures through internally generated funds.

In fiscal 2016, we purchased $798 million of investments, compared to $431
million in fiscal 2015. Additionally, $681 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2016 compared to $388 million in the prior year. The increased investment activity in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of changing the investments of
our Executive Savings Plan. This change in investments resulted in $154 million of assets being liquidated and then reinvested in new investment options. The balance of this activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial
maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. Finally, investing activities include the initial payment of $57 million for the acquisition of Trade Secret.

Financing activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $2,176 million in fiscal 2016, $1,560
million in fiscal 2015 and $1,144 million in fiscal 2014.

TJX repurchased and retired 26.5 million shares of its common stock at a
cost of $1.8 billion during fiscal 2016, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.8 billion to
repurchase 26.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016, $1.7 billion to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015 and $1.5 billion to repurchase 27.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014. See Note D to the
consolidated financial statements for more information. In February 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX stock. We currently
plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2017. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow,
liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.84 per share in fiscal 2016, $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015 and $0.58 per share
in fiscal 2014. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $544 million in fiscal 2016, $466 million in fiscal 2015 and $394 million in fiscal 2014. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $132 million
in fiscal 2016, $143 million in fiscal 2015 and $146 million in fiscal 2014. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2017 of $0.26 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.04 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of
Directors. This would represent a 24% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2016.

In June 2014, we issued
$750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% seven-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $743 million. In July 2014, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2.75% seven-year notes to redeem the $400
million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes paying $416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes. In fiscal 2014, we issued $500 million of 2.50% ten-year notes
generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $495 million. See Note J to the consolidated financial statements for more information.


We traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise,
primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of January 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, of
which $355.4 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. We have provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy,
India and Hong Kong. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we would not expect to incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. For all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided
on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. We have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. We believe our existing cash and cash
equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. Our credit facilities were amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and are more fully described in Note
J to the consolidated financial statements.

Contractual obligations:

As of January 30, 2016, we had known contractual
obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligations.

(2)

Reflects minimum rent. Does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items
totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2016.

(3)

Includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive
employment and other agreements. Excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term
liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $418.2 million for employee compensation and benefits, and $33.4 million for uncertain tax positions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We prepare our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and
estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas
described below.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except STP and
Trade Secret. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in
our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to
markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of
permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory
shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the


fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. We do not
generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.

Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames:

We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events
or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of
factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets
over the estimated fair value of the assets.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of
an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the
discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. These assumptions, including the
discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the
funded status of our qualified pension plan. If our discount rate decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2016 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $8 million. Similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of
0.25 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost. A change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2016 pension cost by approximately $3 million. During fiscal
2015, we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality (the expected lives of our pension participants) in light of new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries which project longer life expectancies. The change in our mortality
assumptions added $59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of January 31, 2015 and added approximately $7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost. When the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets,
changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. We also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions
we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2016, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $50 million.

Share-based compensation:

In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards is
amortized as “share-based compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the
related compensation cost. A 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 4% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 5%.

Casualty insurance:

Our casualty insurance program is a self-insured program which requires us to estimate the total
claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and
assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2016 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2016 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4
million. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $19.7 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of
January 30, 2016.


Reserves for uncertain tax positions:

Like many large corporations, our income and other
tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various
administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and
settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for
exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax
positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other
resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination
or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the
period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

Loss contingencies:

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or
fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought
therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Some potential market risks are discussed below:

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We are
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt
and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations. Our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. As more fully described in Note E to our consolidated financial
statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international
operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and


swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. Our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. We have performed
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our
reporting currency. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre-tax income for the
fiscal year by approximately $69 million and $73 million, respectively.

EQUITY PRICE AND OTHER MARKET RISK

The assets of our funded qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the
financial markets. We invest the pension assets (described further in Note I to the consolidated financial statements) in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to
various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in
increased required contributions to the plan or other plan-related liabilities. Our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of
the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of implementing controls and procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 identified in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


(c) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes those policies and procedures that:

—

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of TJX;

—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of TJX are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of TJX’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework 2013

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2016.

(d) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on our consolidated financial statements
contained herein, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting included herein.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For Fiscal Years Ended January 30,
2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014.

F-1

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The TJX Companies, Inc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The TJX
Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework 2013

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and
the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for the classification of deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheets due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A.    Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements of The TJX Companies, Inc. (referred to as
“TJX,” “we” or “the Company”) include the financial statements of all of TJX’s subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of its activities are conducted by TJX or its subsidiaries and are consolidated in
these financial statements. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to the last day of January of each year. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016), January 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015) and February 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014) each included 52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise indicated.

Use of Estimates:

Preparation of the TJX Companies, Inc. financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TJX considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuation, impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames, retirement
obligations, share-based compensation, casualty insurance, reserves for uncertain tax positions and loss contingencies to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management estimates and judgments. Actual amounts could differ from
those estimates, and such differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the time of sale and
receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the customer
receives the layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards as well as the value of store cards issued to customers as a result of a return or exchange are deferred until the customers use the cards to acquire merchandise. Based on
historical experience, we estimate the amount of gift cards and store cards that will not be redeemed (referred to as breakage) and, to the extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized into income over the redemption period. Revenue
recognized from breakage was $13.8 million in fiscal 2016, $17.8 million in fiscal 2015 and $17.5 million in fiscal 2014. We estimate the date of receipt by the customer when recognizing revenue from sales by our e-commerce operations and shipping
and handling costs charged to the customer are included in revenue. The shipping and handling costs incurred by TJX are included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, includes the cost of
merchandise sold including foreign currency gains and losses on merchandise purchases denominated in other currencies; gains and losses on inventory and fuel-related derivative contracts; store occupancy costs (including real estate taxes, utility
and maintenance costs and fixed asset depreciation); the costs of operating distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check expenses;
advertising; administrative and field management payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other miscellaneous income and
expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or
less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments. These investments are classified as trading securities and
are stated at fair value. Investments are classified as either short- or long-term based on their original maturities. TJX’s investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper, institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
banks.

As of January 30, 2016, TJX’s cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, of which $355.4
million was held in countries where TJX has the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely.

F-8

Merchandise Inventories

:

Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for valuing inventories at all of its businesses, except Sierra Trading Post (STP), and Trade Secret. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost
before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (e.g. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, TJX utilizes a permanent markdown strategy and lowers the
cost value of the inventory that is subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered in the stores. TJX accrues for inventory obligations at the time title transfers, which is typically at the time when inventory is shipped. As a
result, merchandise inventories on TJX’s balance sheet include an accrual for in-transit inventory of $690.3 million at January 30, 2016 and $495.2 million at January 31, 2015. Comparable amounts were reflected in accounts payable at
those dates.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions consist primarily of the repurchase by TJX of its common stock
under its stock repurchase programs and the recognition of compensation expense and issuance of common stock under TJX’s Stock Incentive Plan. Under TJX’s stock repurchase programs the Company repurchases its common stock on the open
market. The par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged against any available additional paid-in capital (APIC) and the balance charged to retained earnings. Due to the
high volume of repurchases over the past several years, TJX has no remaining balance in APIC at the end of any of the years presented. All shares repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under TJX’s Stock Incentive Plan are issued from authorized but unissued shares, and proceeds received are recorded by increasing common stock for the par value of the shares with the excess over
par added to APIC. Income tax benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets up to the amount that an asset for the
related grant has been created. Any tax benefits greater than the deferred tax assets created at the time of expensing the options are credited to APIC; any deficiencies in the tax benefits are debited to APIC to the extent a pool for such
deficiencies exists. In the absence of a pool, any deficiencies are realized in the related periods’ statements of income through the provision for income taxes. Any excess income tax benefits are included in cash flows from financing
activities in the statements of cash flows. The par value of restricted stock awards is also added to common stock when the stock is issued, generally at grant date. The fair value of the restricted stock awards in excess of par value is added to
APIC as the awards are amortized into earnings over the related requisite service periods.

Share-Based Compensation:

TJX
accounts for share-based compensation by estimating the fair value of each award on the date of grant. TJX uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for options awarded and the market price on the grant date for performance-based restricted stock
awards. See Note H for a detailed discussion of share-based compensation.

Interest

:

TJX’s
interest expense is presented net of capitalized interest and interest income. The following is a summary of net interest expense:

TJX capitalizes interest during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is
added to the cost of the related assets. Capitalized interest in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 relates to costs on active owned real estate projects and development costs on a merchandising system.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and amortization of property using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are generally amortized over their useful life or the committed lease term (typically 10 years), whichever
is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for property was $622.0 million in fiscal 2016, $595.6 million in fiscal 2015 and $555.8 million in fiscal 2014. TJX had no
property held under capital lease during fiscal 2016, 2015, or

F-9

2014. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant costs incurred for internally developed software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 15 years. Upon retirement or
sale, the cost of disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or loss is included in income. Pre-opening costs, including rent, are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

TJX begins to record rent expense when it takes possession of a store, which is typically 30 to 60 days prior to the
opening of the store and generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term, as specified in the lease. Lease agreements involving property built to our specifications are reviewed to determine if our involvement in the construction project
requires that we account for the project costs as if we were the owner for accounting purposes. We have entered into several lease agreements where we are deemed the owner of a construction project for accounting purposes. Thus, during construction
of the facility the construction costs incurred by the lessor are included as a construction in progress asset along with a related liability of the same amount on our balance sheet. Upon completion of the project, a sale-leaseback analysis is
performed to determine if the Company should record a sale to remove the related asset and related obligation and record the lease as either an operating or capital lease obligation. If the Company is precluded from derecognizing the asset when
construction is complete, due to continuing involvement beyond a normal leaseback, the lease is accounted for as a financing transaction and the recorded asset and related financing obligation remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly,
the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life in accordance with the Company’s policy and a portion of the lease payments is allocated to ground rent and treated as an operating lease. The portion of the lease payment allocated to
ground rental expense is based on the fair value of the land at the commencement of construction. Lease payments allocated to the non-land asset are recognized as reductions to the financing obligation and interest expense.

Long-Lived Assets:

Information related to carrying values of TJX’s long-lived assets by geographic location is presented below:

Goodwill and Tradenames:

Goodwill includes the excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying
value of the minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former 83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the T.J. Maxx chain, as well as the excess of cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets
acquired by TJX in the purchase of Winners in fiscal 1991, the purchase of Sierra Trading Post in fiscal 2013, and the purchase of Trade Secret in fiscal 2016 (See Note B). The following is a rollforward of goodwill by component:

Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not amortized.

F-10

Tradenames are the value assigned to the name “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 as
part of the acquisition of the Marshalls chain, the value assigned to the name “Sierra Trading Post,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 2013 and the value assigned to the name “Trade Secret,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 2016. The
tradenames were valued by calculating the discounted present value of assumed after-tax royalty payments. The Marshalls tradename is carried at a value of $107.7 million and is considered to have an indefinite life. The Sierra Trading Post tradename
is being amortized over 15 years and was carried at a value of $30.6 million in fiscal 2016, $33.2 million in fiscal 2015 and $35.7 million in fiscal 2014 net of amortization of $7.9 million, $5.3 million and $2.8 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015
and fiscal 2014, respectively. The Trade Secret tradename is being amortized over 10 years and was carried at a value of $11.6 million in fiscal 2016 net of amortization of $300,000.

TJX occasionally acquires or licenses other trademarks to be used in connection with private label merchandise. Such trademarks are included in
other assets and are amortized to cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, over their useful life, generally from 7 to 10 years.

Goodwill, tradenames and trademarks, and the related accumulated amortization if any, are included in the respective operating segment to which they relate.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Tradenames:

TJX evaluates its long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames for indicators
of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash flow of an asset
or asset group is less than the carrying cost of that asset or asset group.

The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the
lowest level of identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of other groups of assets, which is generally at the individual store level. If indicators of impairment are identified, an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed to
determine if an impairment exists. The store-by-store evaluations did not indicate any recoverability issues in each of the past three fiscal years.

Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred and at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, using a quantitative
assessment by comparing the carrying value of the related reporting unit to its fair value. An impairment exists when this analysis, using typical valuation models such as the discounted cash flow method, shows that the fair value of the reporting
unit is less than the carrying cost of the reporting unit. We may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The assessment of
qualitative factors is optional and at the Company’s discretion. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test.

Tradenames are also tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the tradename may exceed
its fair value and at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Testing is performed by comparing the discounted present value of assumed after-tax royalty payments to the carrying value of the tradename.

There was no impairment related to our goodwill or tradenames in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was $382.9 million for fiscal 2016, $371.3 million
for fiscal 2015 and $333.5 million for fiscal 2014.

Foreign Currency Translation:

TJX’s foreign assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Activity of the foreign
operations that affect the statements of income and cash flows is translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount
of the loss is reasonably estimable. TJX evaluates pending litigation and other contingencies at least quarterly and adjusts the reserve for such contingencies for changes in probable and reasonably estimable losses. TJX includes an estimate for
related legal costs at the time such costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

F-11

New Accounting Standards:

In May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that creates common
revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance supersedes most preexisting revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed an update to this rule which would defer its effective date
for one year. The proposed update stipulates the new standard would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled
effective date. The standard shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. For TJX, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending
February 2, 2019. TJX is in the process of evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, a pronouncement was issued that allows employers with fiscal year ends that do not coincide with a calendar month end to make an accounting policy election to measure defined benefit plan assets and
obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end. This update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. TJX is in the process of evaluating this guidance to determine the
impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. For TJX, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. TJX expects to change the presentation of our debt issuance costs as prescribed by the new guidance.

In May 2015, a pronouncement was issued that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for
which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The pronouncement also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset
value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted and TJX has adopted these provisions, including the retrospective application, to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, a pronouncement was issued that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for
measurement period adjustments following a business combination. The guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The portion of the
adjustment which relates to a prior period should either be presented separately on the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. TJX does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires entities to present deferred tax
assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. It simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
Netting of DTAs and DTLs by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance. This pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years; early adoption is
permitted. TJX has adopted this guidance as of January 30, 2016, and has applied it retrospectively. As a result, we have recast the January 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. The adoption of
this standard reduced previously-presented current DTAs by $137.6 million, decreased long-term DTAs by $2.0 million and reduced long-term DTLs by $139.6 million as of January 31, 2015.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which will replace the existing
guidance in ASC 840, “Leases.” The updated standard aims to increase transparency and

F-12

comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods; early adoption is permitted and modified retrospective application is required. TJX is in the process of evaluating
this guidance to determine the impact it will have on our financial statements.

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued ASU 2016-04 “Liabilities-Extinguishments of Liabilities.” The updated standard aims to address the diversity in practice related to the derecognition of prepaid store-value product liabilities. ASU 2016-04 is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods; early adoption is permitted and modified retrospective application is required. TJX is in the process of evaluating this guidance to determine the impact
it will have on our financial statements.

Note B.    Acquisition of Trade Secret

On October 24, 2015, TJX purchased Trade Secret, an off-price retailer that operates 35 stores in Australia, for
approximately AUD$83 million (U.S. $59 million), which is subject to customary post-closing adjustments.

The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.

The following table presents the allocation of the purchase price (after preliminary adjustment for customary post-closing adjustments) to the
assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of October 24, 2015:

As is customary, the amounts above may be further adjusted up to one year after date of acquisition.

Goodwill and intangible assets include identified intangible assets of $12 million for the value of the tradename “Trade Secret” which is
being amortized over 10 years, and $25 million representing goodwill (See Note A).

The operating results of Trade Secret have been
included in TJX’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and Trade Secret is now part of the TJX International segment along with our European operations. Pro forma results of operations assuming the acquisition of Trade
Secret occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 have not been presented as the inclusion of the results of operations for the acquired business would not have produced a material impact on TJX’s sales, net income or earnings per share as
reported.

F-13

Note C.    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relate to the Company’s foreign currency translation
adjustments, minimum pension and other post-retirement liabilities and cash flow hedge on issued debt, all of which are recorded net of the related income tax effects. The following table details the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014:

Note D.    Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

TJX repurchased and retired 26.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.8 billion
during fiscal 2016, on a “trade date basis.” TJX reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis. TJX had cash expenditures under repurchase programs of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016,
$1.7 billion in fiscal 2015 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014, and repurchased 26.6 million shares in fiscal 2016, 27.6 million shares in fiscal 2015 and 27.3 million shares in fiscal 2014. These expenditures were funded primarily by
cash generated from operations. As of January 30, 2016 TJX had $1.5 billion available under the existing $2.0 billion stock repurchase program announced by TJX in February 2015. In addition, in February 2016, TJX announced the Board of
Directors had approved the repurchase of an additional $2.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time.

All shares repurchased under
the stock repurchase programs have been retired.

TJX has five million shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock, $1 par value.

F-14

Earnings Per Share:

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted
earnings per share for net income:

The weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per share calculation excludes the impact of outstanding
stock options if the assumed proceeds per share of the option is in excess of the average price of TJX’s common stock for the related fiscal periods. Such options are excluded because they would have an antidilutive effect. There were
4.1 million, 8.8 million and 4.7 million such options excluded at the end of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.

Note E.    Financial Instruments

As a result of its operating and financing activities, TJX is exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign
currency exchange rates as well as fuel costs. These market risks may adversely affect TJX’s operating results and financial position. TJX seeks to minimize risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fuel costs,
to the extent we deem appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. TJX does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and does not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments. TJX
recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statements of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value. The fair values of the derivatives are classified as assets or liabilities, current or
non-current, based upon valuation results and settlement dates of the individual contracts. Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in earnings in the period of the change. For
derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income or are recognized currently in earnings, along with an
offsetting adjustment against the basis of the item being hedged. TJX does not hedge its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Diesel Fuel Contracts:

TJX hedges portions of its estimated notional diesel requirements, based on the diesel fuel expected to be
consumed by independent freight carriers transporting TJX’s inventory. Independent freight carriers transporting TJX’s inventory charge TJX a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases as incurred by the carrier. The hedge
agreements are designed to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel pricing (and the resulting per mile surcharges payable by TJX) by setting a fixed price per gallon for the period being hedged. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, TJX entered into
agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated notional diesel requirements for fiscal 2016. Similarly, during fiscal 2016, TJX entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated notional diesel requirements for the fiscal year ending
January 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017). The hedge agreements outstanding at January 30, 2016 relate to approximately 40% of TJX’s estimated notional diesel requirements for fiscal 2017. These diesel fuel hedge agreements will settle
throughout fiscal 2017. TJX elected not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts.

F-15

Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts
to obtain economic hedges on portions of merchandise purchases made and anticipated to be made by the Company’s operations in Europe (United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, and the Netherlands), TJX Canada (Canada), Marmaxx (U.S.)
and HomeGoods (U.S.) in currencies other than their respective functional currencies. These contracts typically have a term of twelve months or less. The contracts outstanding at January 30, 2016 cover a portion of such actual and anticipated
merchandise purchases throughout fiscal 2017. Additionally, TJX’s operations in Europe are subject to foreign currency exposure as a result of their buying function being centralized in the United Kingdom. All merchandise is purchased centrally
in the U.K. and then shipped and billed to the retail entities in other countries. This intercompany billing to TJX’s European businesses’ Euro denominated operations creates exposure to the buying entity for changes in the exchange rate
between the Euro and British Pound. The inflow of Euros to the central buying entity provides a natural hedge for merchandise purchased from third-party vendors that is denominated in Euros. However, with the growth of TJX’s Euro denominated
retail operations, the intercompany billings committed to the Euro denominated operations is generating Euros in excess of those needed to meet merchandise commitments to outside vendors. TJX calculates this excess Euro exposure each month and
enters a 30 day hedge to mitigate the exposure. TJX elected not to apply hedge accounting rules to these contracts.

TJX also enters into
derivative contracts, generally designated as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and are offset
by marking the underlying item to fair value in the same period. Upon settlement, the realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains and losses of the underlying item in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The following is a summary of TJX’s derivative financial instruments, related fair value and balance sheet classification at
January 30, 2016:

F-16

The following is a summary of TJX’s derivative financial instruments, related fair value and
balance sheet classification at January 31, 2015:

The impact of derivative financial instruments on the statements of income during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and
fiscal 2014 are as follows:

Included in the table above are realized gains of $28.5 million in fiscal 2016, $24.3 million in fiscal 2015 and
$10.7 million in fiscal 2014, all of which were largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying hedged item.

F-17

Note F.    Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date or “exit price.” The inputs used to measure fair value are generally classified into the following hierarchy:

The following table sets forth TJX’s financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis:

Investments designed to meet obligations under the Executive Savings Plan are invested in registered investment
companies traded in active markets and are recorded at unadjusted quoted prices.

Short-term investments, foreign currency exchange
contracts and diesel fuel contracts are valued using broker quotations which include observable market information. TJX’s investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper, institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
banks. TJX does not make adjustments to quotes or prices obtained from brokers or pricing services but does assess the credit risk of counterparties and will adjust final valuations when appropriate. Where independent pricing services provide fair
values, TJX obtains an understanding of the methods used in pricing. As such, these instruments are classified within Level 2.

The fair
value of TJX’s general corporate debt was estimated by obtaining market quotes given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general issuer type and market perceived credit quality. These inputs are considered to be Level 2. The fair
value of long-term debt at January 30, 2016 was $1.70 billion compared to a carrying value of $1.62 billion. The fair value of long-term debt at January 31, 2015 was $1.73 billion compared to a carrying value of $1.62 billion. The fair
value of long-term debt at February 1, 2014 was $1.34 billion compared to a carrying value of $1.27 billion. These estimates do not necessarily reflect provisions or restrictions in the various debt agreements that might affect TJX’s
ability to settle these obligations.

TJX’s cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the short
maturities of these instruments.

Note G.    Segment Information

TJX operates four main business segments. The Marmaxx segment (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and the HomeGoods segment both operate in the
United States, the TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and the TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. TJX also operates Sierra Trading Post,
an off-price Internet retailer that operates a small number of stores in the U.S. The results of STP are included in the Marmaxx segment.

F-18

All of TJX’s stores, with the exception of HomeGoods and HomeSense, sell family apparel and home
fashions. HomeGoods and HomeSense offer home fashions.

The percentages of our consolidated revenues by major product category for the
last three fiscal years are as follows:

For fiscal 2016, TJX Canada and TJX International accounted for 23% of TJX’s net sales, 17% of segment profit
and 23% of consolidated assets.

TJX evaluates the performance of its segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which it
defines as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense, net. “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other entities. These measures of performance should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of TJX’s performance or as a measure of liquidity.

Presented below is financial information with respect to TJX’s business segments:

F-19

Business segment information (continued):

(1)

Corporate identifiable assets consist primarily of cash, receivables, prepaid insurance, the trust assets in connection with the Executive Savings Plan and deferred taxes.
Consolidated cash, including cash held in our foreign entities, is included with corporate assets for consistency with the reporting of cash for our segments in the U.S.

(2)

Includes debt discount accretion and debt expense amortization.

Note H.    Stock Incentive Plan

TJX has a Stock Incentive Plan under which options and other share-based awards may be granted to its directors, officers and key
employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s shareholders, and all share-based compensation awards are made under this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder approval, has provided for the issuance of up to
347.8 million shares with 36.0 million shares available for future grants as of January 30, 2016. TJX issues shares under the plan from authorized but unissued common stock.

Total compensation cost related to share-based compensation was $94.1 million, $88.0 million and $76.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. As of January 30, 2016, there was $132.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of two years.

Options for the purchase of common stock are granted with an exercise price that is 100% of market
price on the grant date, generally vest in thirds over a three-year period starting one year after the grant, and have a ten-year maximum term. When options are granted with other vesting terms, such information is incorporated into the valuation.

F-20

The fair value of options is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate is for periods within the contractual life of the option based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We use historical data to estimate option exercises, employee termination behavior and dividend yield within the valuation model. Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatility from
traded options on our stock, and historical volatility during a term approximating the expected life of the option granted. The expected option life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding based upon
historical exercise trends. Employee groups and option characteristics are considered separately for valuation purposes when applicable.

Stock Options:

A summary of the status of TJX’s stock options and related weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) is presented
below (shares in thousands):

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $227.4 million in fiscal 2016, $286.3 million in fiscal 2015 and
$289.8 million in fiscal 2014.

Performance-Based Stock Awards:

TJX grants performance-based restricted stock, performance-based restricted
stock units and performance-based deferred stock awards (collectively referred to as performance-based stock awards) under the Stock Incentive Plan. These awards are granted without a purchase price to the recipient and are subject to vesting
conditions, including specified performance criteria aligned with management incentive plans for a period of generally one to three years. The grant date fair value of the awards is charged to income over the requisite service period during which
the recipient must remain employed. The fair value of the awards is determined at date of grant in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and assumes that performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met, or only partially met, awards and
related compensation costs recognized are reduced on a pro rata basis.

F-21

A summary of the status of our nonvested performance-based stock awards and changes during fiscal 2016
is presented below:

There were 696,057 shares of performance-based stock awards, with a weighted average grant date fair value of
$70.41, granted in fiscal 2016, 717,500 shares of performance-based stock awards, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $62.85, granted in fiscal 2015, and 743,576 shares of performance-based stock awards, with a weighted average grant
date fair value of $51.02, granted in fiscal 2014. The fair value of performance-based stock awards that vested was $27.1 million in fiscal 2016, $21.4 million in fiscal 2015, and $14.2 million in fiscal 2014.

Other Awards:

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are
awarded two annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX common stock which were valued at $75,000 for fiscal 2016. One award vests immediately and is payable, with accumulated dividends, in stock at the earlier of separation from
service as a director or a change of control. The second award vests based on service as a director until the annual meeting that follows the award and is payable, with accumulated dividends, in stock following the vesting date, unless an
irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2016, a total of 301,654 of these deferred shares were outstanding under the plan.

Note I.    Pension Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension

:

TJX has a funded defined benefit retirement plan that covers eligible U.S. employees
hired prior to February 1, 2006. No employee contributions are required, or permitted, and benefits are based principally on compensation earned in each year of service. TJX’s funded defined benefit retirement plan assets are invested in
domestic and international equity and fixed income securities, both directly and through investment funds. The plan does not invest in TJX securities. TJX also has an unfunded supplemental retirement plan that covers certain key employees and
provides additional retirement benefits based on final average compensation for certain of those employees (the primary benefit) or, alternatively, based on benefits that would be provided under the funded retirement plan absent Internal Revenue
Code limitations (the alternative benefit).

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s funded defined benefit
pension plan (qualified pension plan or funded plan) and its unfunded supplemental pension plan (unfunded plan) for the fiscal years indicated:

F-22

The consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the plans with any unrecognized prior service cost and
actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The combined net accrued liability of $178.1 million at January 30, 2016 is reflected on the balance sheet as of that date as a current liability of $3.2
million and a long-term liability of $174.9 million.

The combined net accrued liability of $221.4 million at January 31, 2015 is
reflected on the balance sheet as of that date as a current liability of $3.5 million and a long-term liability of $217.9 million.

The
estimated prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2017 for the funded plan is $377,000. The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal 2017 is $28.5 million for the funded plan and $3.5 million for the unfunded plan.

In fiscal 2015, the Society of Actuaries issued new mortality tables projecting longer life expectancies that will result in higher postretirement benefit obligations for U.S. companies. Accordingly, we updated our
mortality assumptions at January 31, 2015. The new mortality assumptions increased our funded plan’s benefit obligation by $59 million and the unfunded plan’s benefit obligation by $4 million at January 31, 2015. Both of these
amounts are included in actuarial gains/losses presented in the change in the projected benefit obligation.

TJX determined the assumed
discount rate using the BOND: Link model in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. TJX uses the BOND: Link model as this model allows for the selection of specific bonds resulting in better matches in timing of the plans’ expected cash flows. Presented
below are weighted average assumptions for measurement purposes for determining the obligation at the year-end measurement date:

F-23

TJX made aggregate cash contributions of $55.7 million in fiscal 2016, $151.3 million in fiscal 2015
and $32.7 million in fiscal 2014 to the funded plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments under the unfunded plan. TJX’s policy with respect to the funded plan is to fund, at a minimum, the amount required to maintain a funded status
of 80% of the applicable pension liability (the Funding Target pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code section 430) or such other amount as is sufficient to avoid restrictions with respect to the funding of nonqualified plans under the Internal
Revenue Code. We do not anticipate any required funding in fiscal 2017 for the funded plan. We anticipate making contributions of $3.3 million to provide current benefits coming due under the unfunded plan in fiscal 2017.

The following are the components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to our
pension plans:

The rate of compensation increase presented for the unfunded plan (for measurement purposes and expense purposes) is
the rate assumed for participants eligible for the primary benefit. The assumed rate of compensation increase for participants eligible for the alternative benefit under the unfunded plan is the same rate as assumed for the funded plan.

TJX develops its long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the
portfolio and long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term inflation assumptions.

The unrecognized gains and losses
in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation are amortized over the average remaining service life of participants.

F-24

The following is a schedule of the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five fiscal years
and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter:

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy (See Note F) for pension assets measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of January 30, 2016:

*

In accordance with Subtopic 820-10, certain investments that were measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified
in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of assets presented above.

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for pension assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2015:

*

In accordance with Subtopic 820-10, certain investments that were measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified
in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of assets presented above.

F-25

Pension plan assets are reported at fair value. Investments in equity securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at the composite close price, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, as of the financial statement date. This information is provided by the independent pricing sources.

Short-term investments are primarily cash related to funding of the plan which had yet to be invested as of balance sheet dates.

Certain corporate and government bonds are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the bond is traded. Other bonds are
valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar bonds, the bond is valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes
observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. All bonds are priced by independent pricing sources.

Assets measured at net asset value include investments in limited partnerships which are stated at the fair value of the plan’s partnership
interest based on information supplied by the partnerships as compared to financial statements of the limited partnership or other fair value information as determined by management, cash equivalents or short-term investments are stated at cost
which approximates fair value, fair value of common/collective trusts is determined based on net asset value as reported by their fund managers.

The following is a summary of TJX’s target allocation guidelines for plan assets along with the actual allocation of plan assets as of the valuation date for the fiscal years presented:

TJX employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments is used to
seek to maximize the long-term return on plan assets with a prudent level of risk. Risks are sought to be mitigated through asset diversification and the use of multiple investment managers. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing
basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.

TJX also
sponsors an employee savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all eligible U.S. employees and a similar type of plan for eligible employees in Puerto Rico. Assets under the plans totaled $1,314.8 million as of
December 31, 2015 and $1,275.4 million as of December 31, 2014, and are invested in a variety of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay, subject to limitations. TJX matches employee contributions, up to 5% of eligible
pay, including a basic match at rates of 25% or 75% (based upon date of hire and other eligibility criteria) plus a discretionary match, generally up to 25%, based on TJX’s performance. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the U.S.
plan at a 2% deferral rate, unless the employee elects otherwise. TJX contributed $30.8 million in fiscal 2016, $31.2 million in fiscal 2015 and $29.7 million in fiscal 2014 to these employee savings plans. The plans include a TJX stock fund in
which participants could invest a portion of TJX’s matching contribution. The TJX stock fund was closed to new investments, other than reinvestment of dividends, at the end of calendar 2015. The TJX stock fund represented 7.1% of plan assets at
December 31, 2015, 7.4% of plan assets at December 31, 2014 and 8.3% of plan investments at December 31, 2013.

TJX also
has a nonqualified savings plan (the Executive Savings Plan) for certain U.S. employees. TJX matches employee deferrals at various rates which amounted to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016, $3.5 million in fiscal 2015 and $2.4 million in fiscal 2014.
Although the plan is unfunded, in order to help meet its future obligations TJX transfers an amount generally equal to employee deferrals and the related company match to a separate “rabbi” trust. The trust assets, which are invested in a
variety of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance sheets.

F-26

In addition to the plans described above, TJX also maintains retirement/deferred savings plans for
eligible associates at its foreign subsidiaries. We contributed $9.7 million for these plans in fiscal 2016, $9.3 million for these plans in fiscal 2015 and $8.1 million in fiscal 2014.

Multiemployer Pension Plans:

TJX contributes to certain multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of
collective-bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees. TJX contributed $13.4 million in fiscal 2016, $11.5 million in fiscal 2015 and $11.5 million in fiscal 2014 to the National Retirement Fund (EIN #13-6130178) and was listed in
the plan’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan year ending December 31, 2014. Based on information TJX received from the plan, the Pension Protection Act Zone Status of the National Retirement Fund
is Critical and a rehabilitation plan has been implemented.

The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from
the risks of single-employer pension plans in certain respects, including the following: (a) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (b) if
a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; (c) if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan in which we had
been a contributing employer, we may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

Postretirement Medical

:

TJX has maintained a postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
medical benefits to retirees who are eligible for the defined benefit plan and who retired at age 55 or older with ten or more years of service. During fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active associates and modified the benefit that
was offered to retirees enrolled in the plan at that time.

TJX paid $161,000 of benefits in fiscal 2016 and has a postretirement
liability of $1 million as of January 31, 2016, representing the present value of future benefits TJX expected to pay. The amendment to the plan in fiscal 2006 resulted in a negative plan amendment of $46.8 million, which was being amortized
over the average remaining life of the active participants. As of January 31, 2016 the unamortized balance of $6.2 million was included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2016 there was a pre-tax benefit of $3.5
million reflected in the consolidated statements of income as it relates to this postretirement medical plan.

During fiscal 2017, TJX
decided to terminate the plan and make a discretionary lump sum payment to participants. The settlement of the liability and the recognition of the remaining negative plan amendment is expected to result in a pre-tax benefit of $5.6 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Note J.    Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines

The table below presents long-term debt, exclusive of current installments, as of January 30, 2016 and January 31,
2015. All amounts are net of unamortized debt discounts.

F-27

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of current installments at January 30, 2016
are as follows:

At January 30, 2016, TJX had outstanding $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% seven-year notes, due
June 2021. TJX entered into rate-lock agreements to hedge the underlying treasury rate of all of the 2.75% notes prior to their issuance. The agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges and the pre-tax realized loss of $7.9 million was
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes, resulting in an effective fixed interest rate of 2.91%. In July 2014, TJX used a portion of the proceeds of the 2.75%
seven-year notes to redeem the 4.20% notes and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million, which includes $16.4 million of redemption premium and approximately $400,000 to write off unamortized debt expenses and
discount.

At January 30, 2016, TJX also had outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% ten-year notes due May
2023 and $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes due April 2019. TJX entered into rate-lock agreements to hedge the underlying treasury rate of $250 million of the 2.50% notes and all of the 6.95% notes. The cost of these
agreements are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective notes, resulting in an effective fixed interest rate of 2.57% for the 2.50% notes and 7.00% for the 6.95% notes.

At January 30, 2016, TJX had two $500 million revolving credit facilities, one which was scheduled to mature in June 2017 and one which was
scheduled to mature in May 2016. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and during the years then ended, there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities. At January 30, 2016, the agreements required quarterly payments
on the unused committed amounts of 6.0 basis points for the agreement maturing in 2017 and 10 basis points for the agreement maturing in 2016. These agreements had no compensating balance requirements and had various covenants. Each of these
facilities required TJX to maintain a ratio of funded debt and four-times consolidated rentals to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, consolidated rentals, depreciation and amortization (EBITDAR) of not more than 2.75 to 1.00 on a rolling
four-quarter basis. TJX was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities at the end of all periods presented. In March 2016, the $500 million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in May 2016 was replaced with a new
five-year $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in March 2021 and the $500 million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in June 2017 was replaced with a new four-year $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in March 2020.
The terms and covenants under the new revolving credit facilities are similar to those in the terminated facilities and require quarterly payments of 6.0 basis points on the committed amounts for both agreements. This rate is based on the credit
ratings of TJX’s long-term debt and will vary with specified changes in the credit ratings.

As of January 30, 2016 and
January 31, 2015, TJX’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit facility. As of January 30, 2016 and
January 31, 2015 and during the years then ended, there were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, our European business at TJX International had a
credit line of

£

5million and

£

20 million, respectively. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 and during the years then ended, there were no amounts outstanding on this U.K. credit line.

F-28

Note K.    Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for income taxes includes the following:

TJX had net deferred tax (liabilities) assets as follows:

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes.” This guidance requires deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets and valuation allowances be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and may be

F-29

applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. TJX has elected to early adopt the new reporting standard retrospectively on its fiscal 2016 consolidated financial
statements. The classification for deferred tax assets (liabilities) for fiscal 2015 has been recast to reflect the new reporting standard. Current asset, non-current asset and non-current liability balances were $137.6 million, $24.6 million and
$422.5 million, respectively on the original financial statements for fiscal 2015.

TJX has provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all
undistributed earnings through January 30, 2016 from its subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India and Hong Kong. For all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the approximately $727 million of undistributed
earnings as of January 30, 2016 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. A determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable
because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculations.

As of January 30, 2016, TJX had available for state
income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of $62.4 million which expire, if unused, in the years 2017 through 2035. As of January 31, 2015, TJX had available for state income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of $61.5
million. TJX has analyzed the realization of the state net operating loss carryforwards on an individual state basis. For those states where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the state net operating loss carryforwards
will not be realized, a valuation allowance of $5.1 million has been provided for the deferred tax asset as of January 30, 2016, and $5.1 million as of January 31, 2015.

As of January 30, 2016, the Company had available for foreign income tax purposes (primarily related to Germany, Australia, Austria and the
Netherlands) net operating loss carryforwards of $51.1 million, of which $3.9 million will expire, if unused, in fiscal 2025. The remaining loss carryforwards do not expire. For the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss
carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, TJX had valuation allowances recorded of approximately $6.9 million. As of January 31, 2015, the Company had
available for foreign income tax purposes (primarily related to Germany and Poland) net operating loss carryforwards of $48.3 million.

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate is reconciled below:

TJX’s effective income tax rate increased for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in the
effective income tax rate was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the increase in valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses.

TJX had net unrecognized tax benefits (net of federal benefit on state issues) of $34.1 million as of January 30, 2016, $32.7 million as of January 31, 2015 and $26.2 million as of February 1, 2014.

F-30

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are items that will impact future effective tax rates upon
recognition. These items amounted to $39.0 million as of January 30, 2016, $34.8 million as of January 31, 2015 and $27.8 million as of February 1, 2014.

TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S., fiscal years through 2010 are no longer subject to examination. In Canada, fiscal
years through 2007 are no longer subject to examination. In all other jurisdictions, fiscal years through 2009 are no longer subject to examination.

TJX follows the with and without approach for direct and indirect effects of windfall tax deductions. TJX’s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of
income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties expensed was $1.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2016, $1.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2015 and $4.0 million for the year ended February 1, 2014. The accrued
amounts for interest and penalties are $7.0 million as of January 30, 2016, $10.1 million as of January 31, 2015 and $8.1 million as of February 1, 2014.

Based on the final resolution of tax examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or
changes in, tax positions it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns may change materially from those represented on the financial statements as of January 30, 2016.
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that state tax audit resolutions may reduce unrecognized tax benefits by $0 to $11 million, which would reduce the provision for taxes on earnings.

Note L. Commitments

TJX is committed under
long-term leases related to its continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures and equipment. Most of TJX’s leases are store operating leases with ten-year terms and options to extend for one or more five-year periods in the
U.S. and Canada and ten to fifteen year terms in Europe, some of which have options to extend. Many of the Company’s leases contain escalation clauses and we have the right to terminate some of the leases before the expiration date under
specified circumstances and some with specified payments. In addition, TJX is generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales. These expenses in the
aggregate were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 and are not included in the table below.

The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for continuing operations as of January 30, 2016:

F-31

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations amounted to $1,365.6 million for
fiscal 2016, $1,321.6 million for fiscal 2015 and $1,238.2 million for fiscal 2014. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was $15.7 million in fiscal 2016, $15.2 million in fiscal 2015
and $15.7 million in fiscal 2014. Sublease income was $0.9 million in fiscal 2016, $0.8 million in fiscal 2015 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2014.

As of January 30, 2016 we have two lease agreements for facilities that resulted in TJX being considered the owner of the property for accounting purposes (see Lease Accounting within Note A). One of the
leases is for our home office facility in Canada which did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria and is therefore being accounted for as a financing transaction. The other lease relates to a facility under construction in Europe. Upon completion, a
sale-leaseback analysis will be performed to determine if the Company should record a sale to remove the assets and related obligation and record the lease as either an operating or capital lease obligation. The assets related to these properties
are included in “land and buildings” and the related liabilities of $85.2 million are included in “other long-term liabilities.”

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling $29.3 million as of January 30, 2016 and $42.9 million as of January 31, 2015. Letters of credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

Note M.    Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, Current and Long Term

The major components of accrued expenses and other current liabilities are as follows:

All other current liabilities include accruals for advertising, customer rewards liability, interest, reserve for
sales returns, reserve for taxes, fair value of derivatives, expense payables, purchased services and other items, each of which is individually less than 5% of current liabilities.

The major components of other long-term liabilities are as follows:

Note N.    Contingent Obligations and Contingencies

Contingent Obligations:

TJX has contingent obligations on leases, for which it was a lessee or guarantor, which
were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, TJX has assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of former
businesses for which TJX has reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases,

F-32

and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. TJX does not generally have sufficient
information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. TJX
may also be contingently liable on up to nine leases of former TJX businesses which we believe the likelihood of future liability to TJX is remote.

TJX also has contingent obligations in connection with certain assigned or sublet properties that TJX is able to estimate. We estimate that the undiscounted obligations of (i) leases of former operations not
included in our reserve for former operations and (ii) properties of our former operations if the subtenants do not fulfill their obligations, are approximately $42.6 million as of January 30, 2016. We believe that most or all of these
contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors including our expectation to further sublet.

TJX is a party to various agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses
related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these
contingent obligations.

Contingencies:

TJX is subject to certain legal proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims that
arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, TJX is a defendant in several lawsuits filed in federal and state courts brought as putative class or collective actions on behalf of various groups of current and former
salaried and hourly associates in the U.S. The lawsuits allege violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and of state wage and hour and other labor statutes, including alleged misclassification of positions as exempt from overtime, alleged
entitlement to additional wages for alleged off-the-clock work by hourly employees and alleged failure to pay all wages due upon termination. TJX is also a defendant in lawsuits filed in federal courts brought as putative class actions on behalf of
customers relating to TJX’s compare at pricing. The lawsuits are in various procedural stages and seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. At this time, TJX is not able to predict the outcome of these
lawsuits or the amount of any loss that may arise from them.
