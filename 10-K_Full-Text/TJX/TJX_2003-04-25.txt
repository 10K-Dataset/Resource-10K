PART I

ITEM 1. Business

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the
United States and worldwide. We have positioned ourselves as a synergistic
group of off-price businesses. We offer off-price family apparel and home
fashions through our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains in the United
States, our Winners chain in Canada and our T.K. Maxx chain in the United
Kingdom and Ireland. We also operate HomeGoods in the United States, a chain
that focuses exclusively on off-price home fashions, and we launched a Canadian
home fashions chain called HomeSense in fiscal 2002. The target customer for
all of our chains, except A.J. Wright, is the middle to upper-middle income
shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer.
A.J. Wright targets a more moderate income customer.

Our mission is to deliver an exciting, fresh and rapidly changing
assortment of brand-name merchandise at excellent values to our customers. We
define value as the combination of quality, fashion and price. With
approximately 300 buyers worldwide and about 9,000 vendors, we believe we are
well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal. Our key strengths
include:

As an off-price retailer, we offer fine-quality, name brand and designer
family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from
comparable department and specialty store regular prices. We can offer these
every day savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies, rapid
inventory turns and low expense structure.

We
purchase much of our inventory opportunistically. Different from
traditional retailers which order goods far in advance of the time
they will appear on the selling floor, TJX buyers are in the
marketplace virtually every week. By maintaining a liquid inventory
position, our buyers can buy close to need, enabling them to buy into
current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the
marketplace. As a result, we can offer our customers rapidly changing
inventory at every-day prices substantially lower than regular
department and specialty store prices. Due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in
the marketplace, we are regularly able to buy the vast portion of our inventory
directly from manufacturers, with some merchandise coming from retailers and
others. Virtually all of our buys are made at significant discounts from
initial wholesale prices. TJX sources its merchandise from approximately 9,000
vendors. We generally purchase merchandise to sell in the current selling
season as well as a limited quantity of packaway merchandise that we buy
specifically to store and sell in a future selling season. We are willing to
purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and
do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and markdown
allowances or return privileges or delivery concessions such as drop shipments
to stores or delayed deliveries. Our financial strength, strong reputation and
ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically
diverse network of stores gives us excellent access to leading branded
merchandise.

We rely heavily on sophisticated, internally developed inventory controls
that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores. For
example, highly automated storage and distribution systems track, allocate and
deliver an average of 12,000 items per week to each



T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store. In addition, specialized computer inventory
planning, purchasing and monitoring systems, coupled with warehouse storage,
processing, handling and shipping systems, permit a continuous evaluation and
rapid replenishment of store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions and store
inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally, using
satellite-transmitted information provided by point-of-sale computer terminals.
This process allows us to achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast
array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling
periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers.
While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy shopping environment with emphasis on
customer convenience, we do not spend large sums on store fixtures. Similarly,
our advertising budget as a percent of sales is low with our advertising
focused on awareness of shopping at our stores rather than promoting particular
merchandise. Our high sales per square foot productivity and rapid inventory
turnover also provides expense efficiencies.

Because all of our chains operate with the same off-price strategies and
systems, we are able to capitalize upon expertise and best practices in all our
chains, develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and
grow our various businesses efficiently and effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 25, 2003, we derived 87.4% of our
sales from the United States (30.8% from the Northeast, 16.0% from the Midwest,
26.7% from the South, 0.9% from the Central Plains, 13.0% from the West), 6.6%
from Canada and 6.0% from Europe (specifically in the United Kingdom and
Ireland).

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information is as of January 25,
2003. All references to store square footage are to gross square feet. Fiscal
2002 means the fiscal year ended January 26, 2002, fiscal 2003 means the fiscal
year ended January 25, 2003 and fiscal 2004 means the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2004. Our business is subject to seasonal influences, which causes
us generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
the year. This is common in the apparel retail business. We are incorporating
by reference our segment information from pages 40 and 41 of the Annual Report
under the caption “Segment Information.”

T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS

T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retail chain in the United States, with
713 stores in 47 states. Marshalls is the second-largest off-price retailer in
the United States, with 615 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in Puerto
Rico. We maintain the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
stores through merchandising, marketing and store appearance. This encourages
our customers to shop at both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices
generally 20%-60% below department and specialty store regular prices. Both
chains offer family apparel, accessories, giftware and domestics. T.J. Maxx
also offers women’s shoes and fine jewelry, while Marshalls also offers a
full-line shoe department and a larger men’s department. T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls primarily target female customers who have families with middle to
upper-middle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or
specialty store shopper.



T.J. Maxx and Marshalls operate with a common buying and merchandising
organization and have consolidated administrative functions, including finance
and human resources. The combined organization, known internally as The
Marmaxx Group, offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at
favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name merchandise at
substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community
shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores average approximately 30,000 square feet.
Marshalls stores average approximately 31,000 square feet. We currently expect
to add a net of 79 stores in fiscal 2004. Ultimately, we believe that T.J.
Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately 1,800 stores in the
United States and Puerto Rico.

WINNERS

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in Canada, offering off-price
designer and brand name women’s apparel and shoes, lingerie, accessories,
domestics, giftware, menswear and children’s clothing. We currently operate a
total of 146 Winners stores which average approximately 28,000 square feet.
Beginning in fiscal 2001, selected stores added fine jewelry departments. We
expect to add 13 Winners stores in fiscal 2004. Ultimately, we believe the
Canadian market can support approximately 200 Winners stores.

Winners opened our first seven HomeSense stores, in Canada, in fiscal 2002
and added 8 stores in fiscal 2003 to finish the year with 15 stores. Like our
HomeGoods chain, HomeSense offers off-price home fashions. HomeSense stores
average approximately 25,000 square feet. We currently expect to add 8 stores
in fiscal 2004. We believe that Canada could support approximately 80
HomeSense stores in the long-term.

T.K. MAXX

T.K. Maxx is the only major off-price retailer in any European country.
T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price strategies employed by T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and Winners and offers the same type of merchandise. We currently
operate 123 T.K. Maxx stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. T.K. Maxx
stores average approximately 26,000 square feet. T.K. Maxx opened 22 stores in
the United Kingdom in fiscal 2003. We currently expect to add a total of 30
stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland in fiscal 2004. We believe that the
U.K. and Ireland can support approximately 300 to 350 stores in the long-term.
We also continue to see the European continent as a viable longer-term growth
opportunity for T.K. Maxx and we believe that the European continent could
ultimately support approximately 250 additional stores.

HOMEGOODS

HomeGoods was the first off-price retail chain to focus exclusively on the
home fashions market. HomeGoods offers a broad array of giftware, accent
furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home.
Many of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores; however, we also combine
HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store in a superstore format
that we call T.J. Maxx ‘N More or Marshalls Mega-Store. Stand-alone HomeGoods
stores average approximately 28,000 square feet. In superstores, which average
approximately 53,000 square feet, we dedicate an average of 21,000 square feet
to HomeGoods. The 142 stores open at year-end include 87 stand-alone stores
and 55 superstores. In fiscal 2004,



we anticipate adding a net of 37 HomeGoods stores, including superstores. We
believe that the U.S. market could support approximately 500 freestanding
HomeGoods stores and 150 superstores in the long-term.

A.J. WRIGHT

A.J. Wright, a relatively young chain launched in fiscal 1999, brings our
off-price concept to a different demographic customer, the moderate income
shopper. A.J. Wright stores offer branded family apparel, accessories, shoes,
domestics, giftware and special situation purchases. A.J. Wright stores average
approximately 26,000 square feet. We added 30 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal
2003 and operated 75 stores at fiscal year end. We currently expect to open 25
A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2004. We believe this developing business offers
us the long-term opportunity to open over 1,000 A.J. Wright stores throughout
the United States.

EMPLOYEES

At January 25, 2003, we had approximately 94

,

000 employees, many of whom
work less than 40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

COMPETITION

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. Our
customers focus upon fashion, quality, price, merchandise selection and
freshness, brand name recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. We compete with local, regional and national department, specialty and
off-price stores. We also compete to some degree with any retailer that sells
apparel and home fashions in stores, through catalogues or over the internet.
We purchase most of our inventory opportunistically and compete for that
merchandise with other national and regional off-price apparel and outlet
stores. We also compete with other retailers for store locations.

CREDIT

Our stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry basis. Each chain
accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and others. While TJX
does not operate its own customer credit card program or maintain customer
credit receivables, a TJX Visa card is offered through a major bank for our
domestic divisions. The rewards program associated with this card is partially
funded by TJX.

BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION

We operate a centralized buying organization that services both the T.J.
Maxx and Marshalls chains while each of our other chains has its own
centralized buying organization. All of our chains are serviced through their
own distribution networks.

TRADEMARKS

Our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright, are
registered in relevant countries. Our rights in these trademarks and service
marks endure for as long as they are used.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from pages 43 through 53 of the Annual Report, under
the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition.”

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

TJX is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its
investment in its Canadian (Winners) and
European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Note C to
our consolidated financial statements, on pages 27-28 of our Annual
Report, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment and
certain merchandise commitments in these operations with derivative
financial instruments. TJX enters into derivative contracts only when
there is an underlying economic exposure. TJX utilizes currency
forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in
the underlying exposures, most of which are recorded directly in
shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks we
believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying
exposures described above. As of January 25, 2003 the analysis
indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

TJX’s cash equivalents and short-term investments and certain lines of
credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect
interest earned and paid by the Company. TJX generally does not use
derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest
rates on these items. Instead, TJX believes that the use of primarily
fixed rate debt minimizes exposure to market conditions and the
ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate
financing.

TJX has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable
rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 25,
2003, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have
a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer

effective in ensuring that all material information required to be
filed in this annual report has been made known to them in a timely
fashion. There have been no significant changes in internal controls,
or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls,

deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company’s internal
controls. As a result, no corrective actions were required or
