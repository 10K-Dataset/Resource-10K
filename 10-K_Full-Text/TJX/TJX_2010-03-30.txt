Cautionary
    Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This

Form 10-K

and our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders contain
    “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for
    the safe harbor from liability established by the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including some of the
    statements in this

Form 10-K

under Item 1, “Business,” Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8,
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in
    our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Letter to
    Shareholders” and “Financial Graphs.”
    Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks,
    uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Such
    statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future
    events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current
    facts. We have generally identified such statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “forecast,” “intend,” “looking
    forward,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “project,” “should,”
    “target,” “will” and “would” or
    any variations of these words or other words with similar
    meanings. All statements that address activities, events or
    developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the
    future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, or Exchange Act. These “forward looking
    statements” may relate to such matters as our future
    actions, future performance or results of current and
    anticipated sales, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange
    rates and results and the outcome of contingencies such as legal
    proceedings.

We cannot guarantee that the results and other expectations
    expressed, anticipated or implied in any forward-looking
    statement will be realized. The risks set forth under
    Item 1A of this

Form 10-K

describe major risks to our business. A variety of factors
    including these risks could cause our actual results and other
    expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results
    or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our
    forward-looking statements. Should known or unknown risks
    materialize, or should our underlying assumptions prove
    inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past
    results and those anticipated, estimated or projected in the
    forward-looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you
    consider forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates on
    which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to
    update any forward-looking statement, whether to reflect new
    information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
    however, to consult any further disclosures we may make in our
    future reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (‘SEC’), on our website, or otherwise.




Part I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel
    and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide.
    Our over 2,700 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of
    quality, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally
    20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices
    every day.

Retail Concepts.

We operate eight off-price retail
    chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe and are known for our
    treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values on
    brand-name merchandise. We turn our inventories rapidly relative
    to traditional retailers to create a sense of urgency and
    excitement for our customers and to encourage frequent customer
    visits. Our flexible “no walls” business model allows
    us to expand and contract merchandise categories quickly in
    response to consumers’ changing tastes. The values we offer
    appeal to a broad range of customers across demographic groups
    and income levels. The operating platforms and strategies of all
    of our retail concepts are synergistic. As a result, we
    capitalize on our off-price expertise and systems throughout our
    business, leveraging best practices, initiatives and new ideas
    and developing talent across our concepts. We also leverage the
    substantial buying power of our businesses to develop our global
    relationships with vendors.

In the United States:

—

T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS:

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    (together known as Marmaxx) are the largest off-price retailers
    in the United States with a total of 1,703 stores. We founded
    T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains
    sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home
    fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs,
    wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other
    merchandise, primarily targeting the middle to upper-middle
    income customer demographic. We differentiate T.J. Maxx and
    Marshalls through product assortment (including an expanded
    assortment of fine jewelry and accessories at T.J. Maxx and a
    full line of footwear and broader men’s and juniors’
    offerings at Marshalls), in-store initiatives, marketing and
    store appearance. This differentiated shopping experience at
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both
    chains.

—

HOMEGOODS:

HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is an
    off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through 323
    stores, it sells a broad array of home basics, giftware, accent
    furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories,
    children’s furniture, seasonal merchandise and other
    fashions for the home. The HomeGoods’ target customers are
    similar to those of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.

—

A.J. WRIGHT:

Launched in 1998, A.J. Wright, like
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, sells off-price family apparel, home
    fashions and other merchandise. Catering to the entire family,
    key apparel categories for A.J. Wright’s 150 stores include
    basics, children’s, women’s plus sizes, juniors, young
    men’s and footwear. Different from all of our other chains,
    A.J. Wright primarily targets the moderate-income customer
    demographic.

In Canada:

—

WINNERS:

Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading
    off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The
    merchandise offering at its 211 stores across Canada and its
    target customers are similar to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. In
    2008, Winners began testing StyleSense, a new concept that
    offers family footwear and accessories.

—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 79 stores
    with a merchandise mix of home fashions and target customers
    similar to HomeGoods.

In Europe:

—

T.K. MAXX:

Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced
    off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major
    off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 263
    stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland as



well as Germany, where it expanded in 2007, and Poland, where it
    expanded in 2009. T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix and targets
    customers similar to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls in the
    U.S. and Winners in Canada.

—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to the U.K. in 2008 and its 14 stores offer a
    merchandise mix of home fashions in the U.K. like that of
    HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. HomeSense
    primarily targets customers similar to those of HomeGoods in the
    U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.

Flexible Business Model.

Our off-price business
    model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size,
    allowing us to react to market trends. Our opportunistic buying
    and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to
    adjust our assortments more frequently than traditional
    retailers, and our stores and distribution centers are built and
    designed to support this flexibility. By maintaining a liquid
    inventory position, our merchants can buy close to need,
    enabling them to buy into current market trends and to take
    advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying close to
    need gives us the ability to turn our inventory more rapidly and
    adjust our pricing to the current market more frequently than
    conventional retailers. Our selling floor space is flexible,
    without walls between departments and largely free of permanent
    fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments in
    response to customer demand, available merchandise and fashion
    trends. Our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate
    our methods of receiving and shipping both small and large
    quantities of product to our large store base quickly and
    efficiently.

Opportunistic Buying.

We are differentiated from
    traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality,
    brand name merchandise. We purchase the majority of our apparel
    inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion
    inventory opportunistically and purchase virtually all of our
    inventory at discounts from initial wholesale prices. Our
    merchant organization numbers over 700, and we operate 12 buying
    offices in the U.S. and abroad. We continue to open many
    new vendors each year, sourcing from a vendor universe of over
    12,000 in fiscal 2010. In contrast to traditional retailers,
    which typically order goods far in advance of the time the
    product appears on the selling floor, our merchants are in the
    marketplace virtually every week, buying primarily for the
    current selling season, and to a limited extent, for a future
    selling season.

We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts
    of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or
    difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue
    to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow. Buying later
    in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and
    maintaining flexibility in adapting to changing conditions, we
    are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire
    merchandise at substantial discounts, such as order
    cancellations and manufacturer overruns, which regularly arise
    from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented
    apparel and home fashions marketplace. As a result, we are able
    to buy the vast majority of our inventory opportunistically and
    directly from manufacturers, with some coming from retailers and
    other sources. A small percentage of the merchandise we sell is
    private label merchandise produced specifically for us by third
    party manufacturers.

We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for
    the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an
    ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are willing to
    purchase

less-than-full

assortments of items, styles and sizes, pay promptly and do not
    ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising,
    promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such
    as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return
    privileges. We are able to purchase quantities of inventory that
    range from small to very large, and we have the ability to sell
    product through a geographically diverse network of stores.
    Importantly, in TJX, we offer vendors an outlet with financial
    strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.

We offer our customers a
    rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
    “treasure hunt” experience in our stores. To achieve
    this, we seek to rapidly turn the inventory in our stores,
    regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions
    at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning,
    purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with
    distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping
    systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to
    local preferences, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on
    a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise
    within targeted selling periods. We make pricing and markdown
    decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations
    centrally, using information provided by specialized computer



systems, designed to move inventory through our stores in a
    timely and disciplined manner. We do not generally engage in
    promotional pricing activity.

Low Cost Operations.

We operate with a low cost
    structure compared to many other traditional retailers. We focus
    aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Our
    advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to
    traditional retailers. We design our stores, generally located
    in community shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient
    shopping environment but do not spend heavily on store fixtures.
    Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost
    effectively. We continue to pursue cost saving strategies in
    areas such as non-merchandise procurement, operating
    efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as
    efficiencies in our supply chain.

Customer Service.

While we offer a self-service
    format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
    helpful customer service. We also have customer-friendly return
    policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash,
    credit cards and debit cards. In the U.S., we offer a co-branded
    TJX credit card and a private label credit card, both through a
    major bank, but do not maintain customer credit receivables
    related to either program.

Distribution.

We operate 13 distribution centers
    in the U.S., 2 in Canada and 4 in the U.K. Our distribution
    centers encompass approximately 11 million square feet. We
    ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through
    these distribution centers, which are large, highly automated
    and built to suit our specific, off-price business model, as
    well as warehouses operated by third parties. We shipped
    approximately 1.6 billion units to our stores during fiscal
    2010.

Store Growth.

Expansion of our business through
    the addition of new stores is an important part of our strategy
    for TJX as a global, off-price, value company. The following
    table provides information on the growth and potential growth of
    each of our chains:

Segment Overview.

We operate five business
    segments: three in the U.S. and one in each of Canada and
    Europe. Each of our segments has its own administrative, buying
    and merchandising organization and distribution network. Of our

U.S.-based

stores, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are
    managed together and reported as a single segment, and A.J.
    Wright and HomeGoods each is reported as a separate segment.
    Outside the U.S., our chains in Canada are managed together, and
    our chains in Europe are managed together. Thus, Canada is
    reported as a segment and Europe is reported as a segment. More
    detailed information about our segments, including financial
    information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be
    found in Note Q to the consolidated financial statements.

Competition.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
    value, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
    recognition, service, reputation and store location. We compete
    with local, regional, national and international department,
    specialty, off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as
    well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and
    other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through
    catalogues or media or over the internet.

Employees.

At January 30, 2010, we had approximately
    154,000 employees, many of whom work less than
    40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
    during the peak

back-to-school

and holiday seasons.

Trademarks.

We have the right to use our principal trademarks and service
    marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners,
    HomeSense, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright, in relevant countries. Our
    rights in these trademarks and service marks endure for as long
    as they are used.

Seasonality.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences. In the second
    half of the year, which includes the

back-to-school

and holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales
    and income.

Sale of
    Bob’s Stores.

In fiscal 2009, we sold Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented,
    branded apparel chain we acquired in fiscal 2004. The loss on
    the sale and historical results of operations have been
    accounted for as discontinued operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The statements in this section describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully, in connection with
    all of the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The risks that follow, individually or in the aggregate, are
    those that we think could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking
    statements.

Global
    economic conditions may adversely affect our financial
    performance.

In 2009, economies worldwide were in crisis, and global
    financial markets experienced extreme volatility, disruption and
    credit contraction. The volatility and disruption to the capital
    markets significantly adversely affected global economic
    conditions, resulting in additional significant recessionary
    pressures and declines in employment levels, disposable income
    and actual and perceived wealth. Although there has been some
    recent improvement, continuing or worsened adverse economic
    conditions, including higher unemployment, energy and health
    care costs, interest rates and taxes and tighter credit, could
    continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary
    consumer spending adversely and may adversely affect our sales,
    cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, renewed
    financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets could
    adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of
    liquidity available to us and could increase our pension funding
    requirements.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues
    and earnings.

In addition to our U.S. businesses, we operate stores in
    Canada and Europe and plan to continue to expand our
    international operations. Sales made by our stores outside the
    United States are denominated in the currency of the country in
    which the store is located, and changes in foreign exchange
    rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these
    businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting
    purposes. Because of this, movements in exchange rates have had
    and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our
    net sales and earnings.

Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging
    instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange on
    merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our
    international segments that is denominated in currencies other
    than their local currencies. In accordance with U.S. GAAP,
    we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make

mark-to-market

adjustments at the end of an accounting period. These
    adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is
    significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a
    significant impact on our earnings.

In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates can increase the
    cost of inventory purchases by our businesses that are
    denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the
    business. When these changes occur suddenly, it can be difficult
    for us to adjust retail prices accordingly, and gross margin can
    be adversely affected.

Although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk
    management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in
    earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
    exchange rates, we expect that foreign currency fluctuations
    could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and
    results of operations.



Failure
    to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management
    could adversely affect our business.

We purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and much of
    our home inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing
    close to need. To drive traffic to the stores and to increase
    same store sales, the treasure hunt nature of the off-price
    buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh,
    high quality, attractively priced merchandise in our stores.
    While opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to
    buy at desirable times and prices, in the quantities we need and
    into market trends, it places considerable discretion in our
    buyers, subjecting us to risks on the timing, pricing, quantity
    and nature of inventory flowing to the stores. In addition, we
    base our purchases of inventory, in part, on sales forecasts. If
    our sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may
    experience higher inventory levels and decreased profit margins
    if we have excess or slow-moving inventory, or we may have
    insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, either of which
    could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition to
    acquiring inventory, we must properly execute our inventory
    management strategies through effectively allocating merchandise
    among our stores, timely and efficiently distributing inventory
    to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory
    in stores, appropriately changing the allocation of floor space
    of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand
    and effectively managing pricing and markdowns. Failure to
    execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory
    management well could adversely affect our performance and our
    relationship with our customers.

Failure
    to continue to expand our operations successfully could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We have steadily expanded the number of concepts and stores we
    operate. Our revenue growth is dependent, among other things,
    upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new
    store openings as well as our ability to increase same store
    sales. Successful store growth requires acquisition and
    development of appropriate real estate including selection of
    store locations in appropriate geographies, availability of
    attractive stores or store sites in such locations and
    negotiation of acceptable terms. Competition for desirable
    sites, increases in real estate, construction and development
    costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our
    ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future
    or adversely affect the economics of new stores. We may
    encounter difficulties in attracting customers in new markets
    for various reasons including customers’ lack of
    familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with
    local customer preferences and cultural differences. New stores
    may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing
    stores, and new and existing stores in a market area may
    adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability.
    Further, expansion places significant demands on the
    administrative, merchandising, store operations, distribution
    and other organizations in our businesses to manage rapid
    growth, and we may not do so successfully.

Failure
    to successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet
    customer demand could negatively impact our
    performance.

Because our success depends on our ability to meet customer
    demand, we take various steps to keep up with customer trends
    and preferences including contacts with vendors, monitoring
    product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping. Our
    flexible business model allows us to buy close to need and in
    response to consumer preferences and trends and to expand and
    contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’
    changing tastes. However, identifying consumer trends and
    preferences and successfully meeting customer demand is
    challenging, and we may not successfully do so, which could
    adversely affect our results.

Our
    quarterly operating results can be subject to significant
    fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or
    investors’ expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at
    points in the past, and they may continue to do so in the
    future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at rates we plan
    and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’
    expectations. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts or investors, our share price may decline. Factors that
    could cause us not to meet our securities analysts’ or
    investors’ earnings expectations include some factors that
    are within our control, such as the execution of our off-price
    buying; selection, pricing and mix of merchandise; and inventory
    management including flow, markon and markdowns; and some
    factors that are not within our control, including actions of
    competitors, weather conditions, economic conditions, consumer
    confidence and seasonality. In addition, if we do not repurchase
    the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock
    repurchase program, our earnings per share may be adversely
    affected. Most of our operating expenses, such as rent expense
    and associate salaries, do not vary directly with the amount of
    sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a
    result, if sales in a particular



quarter are below expectations for that quarter, we may not
    proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and
    therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate
    effect on our net income for the quarter. We maintain a
    forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align
    expenses. If we do not correctly forecast sales or appropriately
    adjust to actual results, our financial performance could be
    adversely affected.

Our
    future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to
    expand within our existing markets and to extend our off-price
    model in new product lines, chains and geographic
    regions.

Our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets
    and to expand to new markets and geographies. This growth
    strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different
    merchandise within our existing stores, continued expansion of
    our existing chains in our existing markets and countries,
    expansion of these chains to new markets and countries, and
    development and opening of new chains, all of which entail
    significant risk. Our growth is dependent upon our ability to
    successfully extend our off-price retail apparel and home
    fashions concepts in these ways. Unsuccessful extension of our
    model could adversely affect future growth or financial
    performance.

Failure
    to implement our marketing, advertising and promotional programs
    successfully, or if our competitors are more effective with
    their programs than we are, may adversely affect our
    revenue.

We use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to
    attract customers to our stores. We use various media for these
    programs, including print, television, database marketing and
    direct marketing. Some of our competitors may have substantially
    larger expenditures for their programs, which may provide them
    with a competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we
    will be able to continue to execute our marketing, advertising
    and promotional programs effectively, and any failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results
    of operations.

Compromises
    of our data security could materially harm our reputation and
    business.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store
    certain personal information from individuals, such as our
    customers and associates, and we process customer payment card
    and check information. We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or
    intrusions (such intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the
    “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of our computer
    system that process and store information related to customer
    transactions, discovered late in fiscal 2007 in which we believe
    customer data were stolen. We have taken steps designed to
    further strengthen the security of our computer system and
    protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to
    data security, consistent with a consent order with the Federal
    Trade Commission. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that
    we will not suffer a future data compromise. We rely on
    commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring
    to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of
    confidential information. Further, the systems currently used
    for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and
    the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of
    which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and
    controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. This is also
    true for check information and approval. Computer hackers may
    attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful,
    misappropriate personal information, payment card or check
    information or confidential Company business information. In
    addition, a Company associate, contractor or other third party
    with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security
    measures in order to obtain such information may or
    inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.
    Advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption
    technology, new tools and other developments may increase the
    risk of such a breach. Any such compromise of our data security
    and loss of personal or business information could disrupt our
    operations, damage our reputation and customers’
    willingness to shop in our stores, violate applicable laws,
    regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional
    costs and liabilities which could be material.

Our
    business is subject to seasonal influences; a decrease in sales
    or margins during the second half of the year could
    disproportionately adversely affect our operating
    results.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences; we generally
    realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
    the year, which includes the

back-to-school

and year-end holiday seasons. Any decrease in sales or margins
    during this period could have a disproportionately adverse
    effect on our results of operations.



We may
    experience risks associated with our substantial size and
    scale.

We operate eight retail chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
    Some aspects of the businesses and operations of the chains are
    conducted with relative autonomy. The large size of our
    operations, our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to
    the chains increase the risk that systems and practices will not
    be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that
    information will not be appropriately shared across different
    chains and countries.

Unseasonable
    weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our
    distribution centers are located could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’
    willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our
    stores. Severe weather could also affect our ability to
    transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution
    centers. As a result, frequent, unusually heavy, unseasonable or
    untimely weather in our markets, such as snow, ice or rain
    storms, severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable
    temperatures, could adversely affect our sales and increase
    markdowns.

Our
    results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or
    catastrophic events.

Unforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and
    epidemics, as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes,
    tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and
    climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States
    or abroad, could disrupt the operations of one or more of our
    vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our
    stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas.
    Our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport
    products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could
    be required to close stores or distribution centers in the
    affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution
    center. As a result, our business could be adversely affected.

We
    operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to
    compete effectively.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete with many other local, regional,
    national and international retailers that sell apparel, home
    fashions and other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores,
    through catalogues or media or over the internet. We compete on
    the basis of fashion, quality, price, value, merchandise
    selection and freshness, brand name recognition, service,
    reputation and store location. Other competitive factors that
    influence the demand for our merchandise include our
    advertising, marketing and promotional activities and the name
    recognition and reputation of our chains. If we fail to compete
    effectively, our sales and results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

Failure
    to attract and retain quality sales, distribution center and
    other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced
    buying and management personnel could adversely affect our
    performance.

Our performance depends on recruiting, developing, training and
    retaining quality sales, distribution center and other
    associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and
    management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level
    or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover.
    The nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us
    to the risk of immigration law violations, which risk has
    increased in recent years. Our ability to meet our labor needs
    while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors
    such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage
    legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance
    costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the
    event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages
    competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline,
    causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our
    wages could cause our earnings to decrease. In addition, certain
    associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and
    therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions. Because of
    the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must do
    significant internal training and development for a substantial
    number of our associates. The market for retail management is
    highly competitive and, in common with other retailers, we face
    challenges in securing sufficient management talent. If we do
    not continue to attract and retain quality associates and
    management personnel, our performance could be adversely
    affected.



If we
    engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses, or divest
    any of our current businesses, our business will be subject to
    additional risks.

We have grown our business in part through mergers and
    acquisitions and may acquire new businesses or divest current
    businesses. Acquisition or divestiture activities may divert
    attention of management from operating the existing businesses.
    We may do a

less-than-optimal

job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits,
    and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and
    time-consuming. Acquisitions may not meet our performance and
    other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or

greater-than-expected

liabilities and risks. Divestiture also involves risks, such as
    the risks of exposure on lease obligations, obligations
    undertaken in the disposition and potential liabilities that may
    arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent
    failure of the acquirer. Failure to execute on mergers or
    divestitures in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our
    future results of operations and financial condition.

Failure
    to operate information systems and implement new technologies
    effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or
    profitability.

The efficient operation and successful growth of our business
    depends on our information systems, including our ability to
    operate them effectively and to select and implement new
    technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery
    systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to
    perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them
    effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to
    liability and thereby harm our profitability.

We depend
    upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to
    fund our expansion, operations, interest and debt repayment,
    stock repurchases and dividends.

Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash
    flow, and to some extent upon the availability of financing
    sources, to supply capital to fund our expansions, general
    operating activities, stock repurchases, dividends, interest and
    debt repayment. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient
    cash flows to support these activities or the lack of
    availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate
    terms when needed could adversely affect our financial
    performance including our earnings per share.

General
    economic and other factors may adversely affect consumer
    spending, which could adversely affect our sales and operating
    results.

Interest rates; recession; inflation; deflation; consumer credit
    availability; consumer debt levels; energy costs; tax rates and
    policy; unemployment trends; threats or possibilities of war,
    terrorism or other global or national unrest; actual or
    threatened epidemics; political or financial instability; and
    general economic, political and other factors beyond our control
    have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending.
    Consumer spending, in turn, affects sales at retailers, which
    may include TJX. Although we benefit from being an off-price
    retailer, these factors could adversely affect our sales and
    performance if we are not able to implement strategies to
    mitigate them promptly and successfully.

Issues
    with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation,
    sales and financial results.

Various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we
    do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise
    we sell in our stores. Regulations and standards in this area,
    including those related to the Consumer Product Safety
    Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, may change from
    time to time. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with
    regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or
    penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results. Issues with the quality and safety and
    genuineness of merchandise, regardless of our fault, or customer
    concerns about such issues, could cause damage to our reputation
    and could result in lost sales, uninsured product liability
    claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs, and
    regulatory, civil or criminal fines or penalties, any of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.



We are
    subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise
    from abroad.

Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our
    vendors and, to a limited extent, by us, in many foreign
    countries. As a result, we are subject to the various risks of
    doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from
    abroad, such as:

—

potential disruptions in supply;

—

changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and voluntary export
    restrictions on imported merchandise;

—

strikes and other events affecting delivery;

—

consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise;

—

product compliance with laws and regulations of the destination
    country;

—

concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor
    rights and conditions in foreign countries where merchandise is
    produced;

—

compliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business
    practices, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act; and

—

economic, political or other problems in countries from or
    through which merchandise is imported.

Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs,
    currency exchange rates, labor conditions, transport capacity
    and costs, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and
    regulations and other factors relating to international trade
    and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the
    availability and the price of our inventory. Furthermore,
    although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to
    facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to
    doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from
    abroad, there can be no assurance that our associates,
    contractors, agents, vendors or other third parties with whom we
    do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our
    policies, which could adversely affect our operations or
    operating results.

Our
    expanding international operations increasingly expose us to
    risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions.

We have a significant retail presence in Canada and Europe, as
    well as buying offices around the world, and our goal as a
    global retailer is to continue to expand into other
    international markets in the future. Our foreign operations
    encounter risks similar to those faced by our
    U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign
    operations, such as understanding the retail climate and trends,
    local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets,
    complying with foreign laws, rules and regulations, and foreign
    currency fluctuations, which could have an adverse impact on our
    profitability.

Our
    results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price
    of oil.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past.
    Fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation
    costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and
    costs to purchase our products from suppliers. Continued
    volatility in oil prices could adversely affect consumer
    spending and demand for our products and increase our operating
    costs, both of which could have an adverse effect on our
    performance.

Failure
    to comply with existing laws, regulations and orders or changes
    in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our
    business operations and financial performance.

We are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws,
    rules and regulations in the United States and abroad, any of
    which may change from time to time, as well as orders and
    assurances. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules,
    regulations and orders, we may be subject to fines or other
    penalties, which could materially adversely affect our
    operations and our financial results and condition. We must also
    comply with new and changing laws. Further, U.S. GAAP may
    change from time to time, and these changes could have material
    effects on our reported financial results and condition. In
    addition, there have been a large number of new legislative and
    regulatory initiatives and reforms introduced in the U.S., and
    the initiatives and reforms that have been and may be enacted
    may increase our costs.



Our
    results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of
    litigation and other legal proceedings.

We are periodically involved in various legal proceedings, which
    may involve local state and federal government inquiries and
    investigations; tax, employment, real estate, tort, consumer
    litigation and intellectual property litigation; or other
    disputes. In addition, we may be subject to investigations and
    other proceedings by regulatory agencies, including, but not
    limited to, consumer protection laws, advertising regulations,
    escheat and employment and wage and hour regulations. Results of
    legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with
    certainty and may differ from reserves we make estimating the
    probable outcome. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both
    time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause
    significant expense and diversion of management attention. Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to
    significant defense costs, fines, penalties and liability to
    private parties and governmental entities for monetary
    recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees

and/or

require us to change aspects of our operations, any of which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

Our real
    estate leases generally obligate us for long periods, which
    subjects us to various financial risks.

We lease virtually all of our store locations, generally for
    long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary
    distribution centers and administrative offices. Accordingly, we
    are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real
    estate. While we have the right to terminate some of our leases
    under specified conditions by making specified payments, we may
    not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would
    like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we may be required
    to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases,
    which may include, among other things, paying rent and operating
    expenses for the balance of the lease term, or paying to
    exercise rights to terminate, and the performance of any of
    these obligations may be expensive. When we assign or sublease
    leases, we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the
    assignee or sublessee does not perform. In addition, when leases
    expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on
    commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to
    close stores.

Our stock
    price may fluctuate based on market expectations.

The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market
    expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we
    will achieve certain levels of net income. If the securities
    analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or
    lower their projections for future growth and financial
    performance, the market price of our stock is likely to drop. In
    addition, if our quarterly financial performance does not meet
    the expectations of securities analysts, our stock price would
    likely decline. The decrease in the stock price may be
    disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance.



Tax
    matters could adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes
    and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected
    by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before
    taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower
    statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries
    with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of
    deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in U.S. tax
    legislation and regulation, foreign tax laws, regulations and
    treaties, exposure to additional tax liabilities, changes in
    accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax
    matters, which could adversely impact our results of operations
    and financial condition in future periods. In addition, we are
    subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns
    by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and
    foreign countries, such authorities may challenge positions we
    take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such
    authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies
    and refunds, and the results of these examinations, judicial
    proceedings or as a result of the expiration of statute of
    limitations in specific jurisdictions. We regularly assess the
    likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations
    to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
    However, it is possible that the actual results of proceedings
    with tax authorities and in courts, changes in facts, expiration
    of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions
    will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a
    positive or a negative manner, which could materially affect our
    effective income tax rate in a given financial period, the
    amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of
    operations.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year
    ended January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), the 53-week fiscal
    year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009) and the
    52-week fiscal year ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008).
    Like most retailers we have a 53-week fiscal period every five
    to six years. This extra week of sales volume, which also
    provides a lift to pre-tax margins due to the flow of certain
    monthly and annual expenses, impacts comparisons to other fiscal
    periods.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

We entered fiscal 2010 faced with the challenges of a worldwide
    recession and established a three-pronged strategy for managing
    through the challenging economic times: conservatively plan same
    store sales, allowing better flow-through to the bottom line if
    we exceed plans; run with very lean inventories and buy closer
    to need than in the past, increasing inventory turns and
    protecting gross margins; and focus on cost-cutting measures and
    controlling expenses. Implementing this strategy has proven
    successful, and we posted results significantly above our
    expectations and ahead of last year on a consolidated basis and
    for each of our businesses. Customer traffic increased as the
    year progressed, driving sales. Additionally, we took advantage
    of opportunities the environment presented, opening more new
    stores than planned and adding many new vendors. We are
    confident in our ability to continue to grow both sales and
    earnings in fiscal 2011, driving market share with our value
    proposition and continuing the marketing, inventory management
    and cost reduction strategies that were successful in fiscal
    2010.

Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2010 include
    the following:

—

Same store sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6% over the prior
    year. Same store sales growth was driven by significant
    increases in customer traffic, as we attracted new customers
    across various income levels, and strong performance by all of
    our businesses.

—

Net sales increased 7% to $20.3 billion for fiscal 2010.
    Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 3%
    at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to last fiscal year end.
    Increases in consolidated same store sales and sales growth from
    our new stores were partially offset by foreign currency
    exchange rates, which negatively impacted sales growth by
    2 percentage points. Unlike many other retailers, we had a

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009, which benefited fiscal 2009 sales but negatively
    impacted the fiscal 2010 comparison by approximately
    1 percentage point.

—

Our fiscal 2010 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to
    net sales) was 9.6% compared to 7.6% for fiscal 2009. The
    improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increased
    merchandise margins, which were achieved as a result of managing
    the business with substantially lower levels of inventory. The
    comparison of pre-tax margins for fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 was
    adversely impacted by the

rd

week

    in the fiscal 2009 calendar and a favorable adjustment to the
    Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009.
    Combined, these two items benefited the fiscal 2009 pre-tax
    margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points.

—

Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased
    2.1 percentage points, primarily due to improved
    merchandise margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs
    on strong same store sales, partially offset by the benefit to
    fiscal 2009’s cost of sales ratio due to the

rd

week

    included in fiscal 2009. The selling, general and administrative
    expense ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased by 0.1 percentage
    points, with the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense
    leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2010, partially
    offset by a 0.5 percentage point increase due to
    performance-based incentive compensation.

—

Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, or
    $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010 compared to
    $914.9 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal
    2009. Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations benefited by $0.16 per share from a number of items,
    which affected the

year-over-year

comparison; the

rd

week

    added $0.09 per share, the credit to the Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs added $0.04 per share and a tax related
    adjustment added $0.03 per share.



—

During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 27.0 million shares of
    our common stock for $950 million. This year’s
    repurchases included the use of the $375 million proceeds
    from our April 2009 debt offering to repurchase a majority of
    the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion of our zero
    coupon convertible subordinated notes called for redemption.
    Diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock
    repurchase program.

—

Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing
    operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution
    centers, were down 10% at the end of fiscal 2010 over the prior
    year end as compared to a decrease of 6% at the end of fiscal
    2009 over the prior year end.

The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating
    results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating
    results.

Net sales:

Consolidated net sales for fiscal
    2010 totaled $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of
    $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6%
    increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new
    stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 increased
    4% over net sales of $18.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The
    increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 1% increase
    from the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009 and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by
    a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency
    exchange rates.

New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both
    our consolidated store count and our selling square footage
    increased by 3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Both
    our consolidated store count and our selling square footage
    increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 over the prior fiscal year. We
    expect to add 130 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2011,
    a 5% increase in both our consolidated store base and our
    selling square footage.

The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by
    significant increases in customer traffic at all of our
    businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the
    average transaction. The increase in customer traffic
    accelerated during the course of the year. Juniors, dresses,
    children’s apparel, footwear, accessories and home fashions
    performed particularly well in fiscal 2010. Geographically, same
    store sales increases in Europe and Canada trailed the
    consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout
    the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West Coast above the
    average, and New England and Florida below the average.

The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a
    strong first half performance, especially at our international
    segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the
    second half of the year largely due to the economic recession.
    Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in
    fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, but was
    partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average
    transaction. As for merchandise categories, footwear,
    accessories and dresses were the strongest performers, while
    home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market
    and economic conditions. Geographically, same store sales in
    Canada and Europe were above the consolidated average for fiscal
    2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and
    Florida trailed the consolidated average.

We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have
    been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal
    years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third
    fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store
    until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which
    stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the
    beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains
    constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We
    calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and
    prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned.
    Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are
    generally classified in the same way as the original store, and
    we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated
    same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our
    foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis,
    meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of
    our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the
    prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency
    exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of
    divisional operating performance.

Impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates:

Our operating results can benefit or be
    adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a
    result of significant changes in the value of the
    U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of the
    more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are
    as follows:

Translation of foreign operating results into
    U.S. dollars:

In our financial statements, we translate
    the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local
    currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect
    at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign
    exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in
    meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from
    continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as
    the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European
    segments. Currency translation generally does not affect
    operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign
    operations are translated at essentially the same rates each
    period.

Inventory hedges:

We routinely enter into
    inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our
    international divisions purchase goods in currencies other than
    their local currencies (primarily U.S. dollar purchases).
    As we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined
    by U.S. GAAP, we record a

mark-to-market

gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of
    operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent
    periods, the income statement impact of these adjustments is
    effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold.
    While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of
    much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant
    changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of
    time. The

mark-to-market

adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it
    does affect cost of sales, operating margins and reported
    earnings.

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
    costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.8% in
    fiscal 2010, 75.9% in fiscal 2009 and 75.7% in fiscal 2008. The
    improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved
    consolidated merchandise margin, which increased
    2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the
    6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs,
    which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin
    improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner
    inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an
    increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared
    to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a
    benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the

rd

week

    (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for
    fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by
    higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation
    that covers many associates across our organization. The higher
    accruals are the result of operating performance that was well
    ahead of our objectives.

This ratio for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008,
    increased 0.2 percentage points primarily due to deleverage
    of buying and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales
    increase. This deleverage more than offset a benefit to this
    expense ratio due to the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009 (approximately 0.2 percentage points) as
    well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of
    0.2 percentage points. Throughout fiscal 2009, we
    effectively executed our off-price fundamentals, buying close to
    need, operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of
    opportunities in the market place.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses:

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.4% in fiscal 2010,
    16.5% in fiscal 2009 and 16.3% in fiscal 2008. The improvement
    in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of
    expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives.
    These



improvements were partially offset by the increase in
    performance-based incentive compensation mentioned above, which
    had an even greater impact on selling, general and
    administrative expense ratio increasing it by
    0.5 percentage points.

The fiscal 2009 expense ratio increased slightly compared to
    fiscal 2008 due to deleverage from the low same store sales
    increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially
    offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising
    costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were
    essentially flat compared to fiscal 2008.

Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs:

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable
    losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion.

From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in
    fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2010, we cumulatively
    expensed $171.5 million (pre-tax) with respect to the
    Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of
    $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable
    losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to the
    establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was
    recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction
    in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations,
    settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated
    losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and
    paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the
    reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities on our balance sheet.

As of January 30, 2010, our reserve balance was
    $23.5 million, which reflects our current estimate of
    remaining probable losses with respect to the Computer
    Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings and other claims,
    as well as legal, monitoring, reporting and other costs. As an
    estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, our actual
    costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may
    be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our
    reserve as a result of developments in litigation and claims,
    related expenses, receipt of insurance proceeds and for other
    changes.

Interest expense (income), net:

Interest
    expense (income), net amounted to expense of $39.5 million
    for fiscal 2010, expense of $14.3 million for fiscal 2009
    and income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008. The components
    of net interest expense (income) for the last three fiscal years
    are summarized below:

Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal
    2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the
    $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes
    issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The
    6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for
    redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we
    refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its
    scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the
    4.20% notes. The impact on earnings per share of the
    incremental interest cost of these two debt issuances was
    partially offset by a benefit in our earnings per share, as the
    majority of the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion
    of the convertible notes were repurchased with the net proceeds
    of the 6.95% notes. On a full year basis, we expect the
    benefit of the share repurchase to more than offset the impact
    on fully diluted earnings per share from the interest on the
    6.95% notes. For more information on these note offerings,
    see the discussion under

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than
    fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on
    investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available
    for investment during fiscal 2010.

The change in net interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 was driven by the change in interest income. In
    fiscal 2008, we generated more interest income due to higher
    cash balances available for investment as well as higher
    interest rates earned on our investments.



Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax
    rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2010, 36.9% in fiscal 2009 and 37.9% in
    fiscal 2008.

The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable
    impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the
    reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement
    of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009
    benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010
    by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction
    in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income.

The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 reflected a 1.3 percentage point favorable
    impact of a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax position.
    This benefit in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was
    offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of
    0.4 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our
    Puerto Rico subsidiary. See Note K to the consolidated
    financial statements.

TJX anticipates an effective annual income tax rate of 38.0% to
    38.5% for fiscal 2011.

Income from continuing operations and income per share
    from continuing operations:

Income from continuing
    operations was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, a 33% increase
    over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009, which in turn was a
    17% increase over the $782.4 million in fiscal 2008. Income
    from continuing operations per share was $2.84 in fiscal 2010,
    $2.08 in fiscal 2009 and $1.68 in fiscal 2008. Several items,
    discussed below, affected earnings per share comparisons for
    fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

We estimate that the

rd

week

    in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share in that
    year by $0.09 per share.

The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related
    costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations
    in fiscal 2009 by approximately $0.04 per share. The charge
    relating to the Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008
    adversely affected income from continuing operations in that
    year by $0.25 per share.

Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability
    of our results. Foreign currency rates reduced earnings per
    share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per
    share benefit in fiscal 2009. When comparing fiscal 2009 to
    fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rates reduced earnings
    per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 compared to a $0.01
    per share benefit in fiscal 2008.

In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding
    affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are
    benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased
    27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of
    $950 million in fiscal 2010; 24.0 million shares at a
    cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009; and 33.3 million
    shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2008. We
    significantly reduced our weighted average diluted shares
    outstanding from 442.3 million to 427.6 million in
    fiscal 2010 with the incremental purchase over those planned
    under our stock repurchase program by using the proceeds of our
    April 2009 debt offering to repurchase the majority of the
    15.1 million shares issued on conversion of our zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes following their call.

Discontinued operations and net
    income:

Fiscal 2009 and prior periods include the
    loss on the sale of the Bob’s Stores division in
    discontinued operations. In addition, the operating results for
    Bob’s Stores for all periods prior to the sale are included
    in discontinued operations. Including the impact of discontinued
    operations, net income was $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per
    share, for fiscal 2010, $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share,
    for fiscal 2009 and $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for
    fiscal 2008.

Segment information:

The following is a
    discussion of the operating results of our business segments. In
    the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are
    aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and each of HomeGoods and
    A.J. Wright is reported as a separate segment. TJX’s
    stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are reported
    as the TJX Canada segment, and TJX’s stores operated in
    Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe
    segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or
    loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from



operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
    measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial
    information related to our business segments:

Net sales at Marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to
    fiscal 2009. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 7% compared to
    being flat in fiscal 2009.

Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2010 reflected significantly
    increased customer traffic, partially offset by a decrease in
    the value of the average transaction. Categories that posted
    particularly strong same store sales increases included juniors,
    dresses, children’s apparel and footwear. Home categories
    improved significantly at Marmaxx during the year, with same
    store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2010.
    Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country.
    Same store sales were strongest in the Midwest, West Coast and
    Southeast, while New England and Florida trailed the chain
    average for fiscal 2010. We also saw a lift in the net sales of
    stores renovated during the year, and we anticipate increasing
    our store renovation program in fiscal 2011.

Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (“segment
    margin” or “segment profit margin”) increased to
    12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in fiscal 2009. This increase in
    segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase
    in merchandise margin of 2.4 percentage points driven by
    lower markdowns and higher markon. In addition, the 7% increase
    in same store sales provided expense leverage on numerous costs
    as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs,
    which improved by 0.3 percentage points. These increases
    were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as
    a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher accruals for
    performance-based incentive compensation as a result of
    operating performance well ahead of objectives.

Segment margin decreased to 9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in
    fiscal 2008. Segment margin was negatively impacted by an
    increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales
    (0.5 percentage points) due to deleverage on the flat same
    store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase
    in merchandise margin (0.1 percentage point) due to
    increased markon.

As of January 30, 2010, Marmaxx’s average per store
    inventories, including inventory on hand at its distribution
    centers, were down 10% as compared to these inventory levels at
    the same time last year. Average per store inventories at
    January 31, 2009 were down 4% compared to those of the
    prior year period. As of January 30, 2010, inventory
    commitments (inventory on hand and merchandise on order) were
    essentially flat on a per store basis compared to the end of
    fiscal 2009.

We expect to open approximately 53 new stores (net of closings)
    in fiscal 2011, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and
    increasing its selling square footage by 3%.

HomeGoods’ net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010,
    driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to
    a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up
    significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased
    merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased
    markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and
    operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements
    were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory
    levels, which drove better off-price buying and increased
    inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by
    higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation as
    a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives.

HomeGoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared
    to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3%. Segment
    margin of 2.7% for fiscal 2009 was down from 5.1% for fiscal
    2008. Merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009, primarily due
    to increased markdowns and operating costs delevered as a result
    of the decline in same store sales.

In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 9 HomeGoods stores and
    increase selling square footage by 3%.

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%. A.J.
    Wright’s improvement in sales was driven by an increasingly
    better understanding of its customers’ tastes and shopping
    habits, which has led to improved merchandising and marketing.
    Segment profit increased significantly to $12.6 million in
    fiscal 2010, compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in
    fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was
    primarily due to improved merchandise margin. Like our other
    divisions, cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense
    leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset
    by higher accruals for performance-based incentive compensation.

A.J. Wright’s net sales increased 7% for fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008, and segment profit increased to
    $2.9 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in
    fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and
    A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009
    compared to losses in the prior years.

In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 8 A.J. Wright stores and
    increase selling square footage by 6%.

Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense)
    increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Currency
    exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately
    $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store
    sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3% in
    fiscal 2009. Same store sales of juniors, dresses, mens and
    footwear, as well as HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above
    the segment average for fiscal 2010.

Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million
    compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of
    foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by
    $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The

mark-to-market

adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material
    impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in
    fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was
    primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins.
    Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a
    percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating
    efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for
    performance-based incentive compensation as a result of
    operating performance well ahead of objectives.

Net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 5% over fiscal 2008.
    Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by
    approximately $68 million. Same store sales increased 3% in
    fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 5% in fiscal 2008.

Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to
    $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008,
    while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to
    11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by
    $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008.
    However, because currency translation impacts both sales and
    expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In
    addition, the

mark-to-market

adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in
    fiscal 2009 by $1 million, in contrast to a $5 million
    benefit in fiscal 2008, which adversely impacted segment margin
    comparisons by 0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for
    fiscal 2009 reflected increases in distribution center costs and
    store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially
    offset by an increase in merchandise margins.

We expect to add a net of 6 stores in Canada in fiscal 2011 and
    plan to increase selling square footage by 2%.

Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2010 to
    $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009.
    Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by
    approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal
    2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to
    a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010
    increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin
    increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in
    segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise
    margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales
    increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and
    Poland along with higher accruals for performance-based
    incentive compensation. We are encouraged by the performance of
    our stores in Germany and Poland and our HomeSense stores in the
    U.K., but as newer operations, they reduce the segment margin
    generated by the more established T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K.
    and Ireland. We also invested in strengthening the shared
    services infrastructure for our planned European expansion.
    Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment
    profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a
    favorable

mark-to-market

adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the
    conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling.

Net sales for TJX Europe for fiscal 2009 were up 1% compared to
    fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively
    affected fiscal 2009 net sales by approximately
    $282 million. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8%
    to $137.6 million, and segment margin increased
    0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to fiscal 2008.
    Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment
    profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009 as
    compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in segment margin in
    fiscal 2009 reflected improved merchandise margins, partially
    offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of
    sales and the cost of operations in Germany. During fiscal 2009,
    T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following the opening
    of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009,
    T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K.
    with 7 new stores.

As a result of the performance of TJX Europe and the opportunity
    for off-price retail in Europe, we intend to increase the rate
    of expansion in Europe. In fiscal 2011, we plan to open a net of
    48 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and a net of 6 HomeSense
    stores in the U.K. for a net total of 54 new stores in Europe.
    We also plan to expand total TJX Europe selling square footage
    by 16%.

General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes
    represents those costs not specifically related to the
    operations of our business segments and is included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses. The increase in general
    corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is
    primarily due to an $18 million contribution to the



TJX Foundation in fiscal 2010 compared to no contribution in
    fiscal 2009. Additionally, fiscal 2010 had higher
    performance-based incentive and benefit plan accruals as
    compared to fiscal 2009, which were partially offset by benefits
    related to hedging activity.

General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was
    virtually flat.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Operating
    activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $2,272 million in fiscal 2010, $1,155 million in
    fiscal 2009 and $1,375 million in fiscal 2008. The cash
    generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal
    years was largely due to operating earnings. The decrease in
    fiscal 2009 reflected the effects of the economic recession.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased
    $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided
    cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of
    $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal
    2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related
    change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of
    $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a
    $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in
    inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing
    implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner
    inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased
    inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes
    payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by
    $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of
    $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010
    cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of
    February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and
    other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal
    2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance-based
    incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of
    the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes
    to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the
    deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by
    $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable
    impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily
    reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings
    plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by
    $220 million as compared to fiscal 2008. Net income and the
    non-cash impact of depreciation and the sale of Bob’s
    Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal 2009 (including the
    benefit of the

rd

week), provided cash of $1,314 million, an increase of
    $173 million from the adjusted $1,141 million in
    fiscal 2008. The change in deferred income taxes favorably
    impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by $132 million, while
    last year’s deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by
    $102 million. Deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the
    non-cash tax benefit of $47 million relating to the
    establishment of the Computer Intrusion reserve. The favorable
    impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax
    treatment of payments against the Computer Intrusion reserve and
    favorable impact of tax depreciation. The change in merchandise
    inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable offset
    the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it
    resulted in a use of cash of $210 million in fiscal 2009,
    compared to a source of cash of $5 million in fiscal 2008.
    The change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in
    fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the
    payment of our accounts payable due to a change in our buying
    pattern. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities
    resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in fiscal 2009
    versus a source of cash of $203 million in fiscal 2008. In
    fiscal 2008, the increase in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities reflected $117 million for the pre-tax reserve
    established for the Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted
    cash flows, while fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by
    $75 million for payments against and adjustments to this
    reserve. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable
    reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by $49 million compared to an
    increase of $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in
    prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an
    additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of
    February rental payments.



Discontinued operations reserve:

We have a reserve
    for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates
    primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of
    34 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007, as well as certain leases
    of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the
    activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below:

The charges against the reserve in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and
    fiscal 2008 related primarily to the closed A.J. Wright stores.
    In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $3 million for
    exposure to properties related to the sale of Bob’s Stores,
    which was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable
    settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The majority of
    the reserve relates to lease obligations with respect to the
    closure of the A.J. Wright stores and the sale of Bob’s
    Stores. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of
    the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we
    believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an
    original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses,
    after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease
    obligations. The actual net cost of the various lease
    obligations included in the reserve may differ from our initial
    estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease
    obligations may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we
    may incur costs for other leases from former discontinued
    operations, we do not expect to incur any material costs related
    to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts
    estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued
    operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club and 7 additional Bob’s Stores
    leases, both former TJX businesses. Our reserve for discontinued
    operations does not reflect these leases, because we currently
    believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is not
    probable.

Off-balance sheet liabilities:

We have contingent
    obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor,
    which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released
    by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous
    leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
    number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
    former businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had
    a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do
    not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact
    on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
    We do not generally have sufficient information about these
    leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under
    them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of
    the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to
    one or more of these leases.

We also have contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our
    reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases discussed
    above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we
    have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their
    obligations, to be approximately $94 million as of
    January 30, 2010. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.



Investing
    activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include capital
    expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the
    table below:

We expect that capital expenditures will approximate
    $750 million for fiscal 2011, which we expect to fund
    through internally generated funds. This includes
    $216 million for new stores, $289 million for store
    renovations, expansions and improvements and $245 million
    for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in
    capital expenditures is attributable to investment in systems,
    distribution and other infrastructure to support growth as well
    as an increase in planned store openings, and increased spending
    on renovations and improvements to existing stores.

Investing activities for fiscal 2010 include the purchase and
    sale of some short-term investments by TJX Canada, as excess
    cash was invested in funds with initial maturities greater than
    three months to enhance investment returns. Investing activities
    for fiscal 2009 and 2008 also include cash flows associated with
    our net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our
    policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries
    and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash
    received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to
    $14.4 million versus net cash payments of
    $13.7 million in fiscal 2008.

Financing
    activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash
    outflows of $584 million in fiscal 2010, $769 million
    in fiscal 2009 and $953 million in fiscal 2008. The
    majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase
    programs.

Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the
    net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On
    April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes. Related to this
    transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were
    converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used
    the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional
    shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On
    July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. We used a portion of
    the proceeds of this offering to refinance our
    C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009,
    prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder,
    together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes
    on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009.

We spent $950 million in fiscal 2010, $741 million in
    fiscal 2009 and $950 million in fiscal 2008 under our stock
    repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.0 million shares in
    fiscal 2010, 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 and
    33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008. All shares repurchased
    were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash
    basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may
    vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our
    repurchases. During fiscal 2010, we completed the
    $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board
    of Directors in fiscal 2009 and initiated another multi-year
    repurchase program that had been approved by the Board in
    September 2009. As of January 30, 2010, $795 million
    remained available for purchase under the program authorized in
    September 2009. In February 2010, the Board authorized an
    additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. We
    currently plan to repurchase up to approximately
    $900 million to $1 billion of our stock in fiscal
    2011. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases and
    execution of

Rule 10b5-1

plans from time to time based on our assessment of various
    factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, market
    conditions, the economic environment and prospects for the
    business and other factors, and the timing and amount of these
    purchases may change.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which
    totaled $0.48 per share in fiscal 2010, $0.44 per share in
    fiscal 2009 and $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008. Cash payments
    for dividends on our common stock totaled



$198 million in fiscal 2010, $177 million in fiscal
    2009 and $151 million in fiscal 2008. We announced our
    intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock
    to $0.15 per share, effective with the dividend payable in June
    2010, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
    Financing activities also included proceeds of $170 million
    in fiscal 2010, $142 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $134 million in fiscal 2008 from the exercise of employee
    stock options.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise
    requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term
    bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
    We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing
    in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility
    maturing in May 2011. TJX pays six basis points annually on the
    committed amounts under each of these credit facilities. These
    agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have
    various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio
    of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as backup to our
    commercial paper program. As of January 30, 2010 and
    January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding short-term
    borrowings. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term
    borrowings outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010
    and $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average
    interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 1.01%
    in fiscal 2010.

As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, our
    foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX
    Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million credit facility
    for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit
    facility. There were no borrowings under the Canadian credit
    line for operating expenses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. There
    were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for
    operating expenses at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. As
    of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, TJX Europe
    had a credit line of £20 million for our European
    operations. The maximum amount outstanding under this U.K.
    credit line was £1.9 million in fiscal 2010 and
    £6.1 million in fiscal 2009. There were no outstanding
    borrowings on this U.K. credit line at the end of fiscal 2010 or
    fiscal 2009.

We believe that internally generated funds and our current
    credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating,
    debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See
    Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further
    information regarding our long-term debt and other financing
    sources.

Contractual obligations:

As of January 30,
    2010, we had payment obligations (including current
    installments) under long-term debt arrangements, leases for
    property and equipment and purchase obligations that will

The long-term debt obligations above include estimated interest
    costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum
    rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes,
    other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a
    percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third
    of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended
    January 30, 2010.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders
    for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures,
    supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts
    for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under
    executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from
    purchase obligations long-term agreements for services and
    operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities which include
    $254.5 million for employee compensation and benefits, the
    majority of which will come due beyond five years,
    $151.0 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements
    of which



are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and
    $181.7 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is
    not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain
    estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These
    judgments and estimates are continually reviewed and based on
    historical experience and other factors which we believe are
    reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies,
    involving management estimates and judgments, to be those
    relating to the areas described below.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for
    valuing inventory on a

first-in

first-out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of
    inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a

cost-to-retail

ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This
    method is widely used in the retail industry and involves
    management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and
    inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording
    and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method,
    permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when
    the price of an item is reduced. We believe the retail method
    results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other
    inventory accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business
    practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to
    be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates.
    Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for
    interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near
    the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and
    estimated amounts of shrinkage may cause fluctuations in
    quarterly results, but is not a significant factor in full year
    results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled
    with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full
    physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an
    inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many
    retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for
    rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which
    ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have historically
    not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our
    continuing operations.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

We review the
    recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets at
    least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that
    would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not
    recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the
    cash flows of individual stores, as well as our business units,
    which involve a number of factors including historical trends,
    recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we
    determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred,
    we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the
    carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of
    the assets. We believe as of January 30, 2010 that the
    carrying value of our long-lived assets is appropriate.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are
    accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in
    the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far
    in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are
    required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the
    discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long-term
    rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of
    which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The
    discount rate, which we determine annually based on market
    interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return,
    which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two
    factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost
    of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified
    pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during
    fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return, and
    as a result the unfunded status of our qualified plan increased
    significantly at the end of fiscal 2009. Despite this, we were
    not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009, primarily due
    to voluntary funding in prior years. In fiscal 2010 we funded
    our qualified pension plan with $132.7 million and may make
    additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2011.

Share-based compensation:

In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, TJX estimates the fair value of stock awards
    issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive
    plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as
    “share-based compensation expense” over the vesting
    periods during which the recipients are required to provide
    service. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
    determining the fair value of stock options granted, which
    requires management to make significant judgments and estimates.
    The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a
    material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option
    grants and the related expense.



Casualty insurance:

In fiscal 2008, we initiated a
    fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Previously,
    our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total
    claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance
    cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of
    an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors.
    These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions,
    and actual results could differ from these estimates. A large
    portion of these claims are funded with a non-refundable payment
    during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual.
    We had a net accrual of $17.1 million for the unfunded
    portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 30,
    2010.

Income taxes:

Like many large corporations, our
    income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and
    local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign
    countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge
    positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings
    with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims,
    deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we
    evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of
    the facts, circumstances and information available at the
    reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that
    it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that
    the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However,
    it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the
    final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative
    proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of
    limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of,
    or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or
    negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in
    accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination
    or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such
    final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material
    adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in
    which a examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period
    in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably
    estimable.

Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for
    discontinued operations:

As discussed in Note B and
    Note N to the consolidated financial statements and
    elsewhere in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we
    have reserves for probable losses arising out of the Computer
    Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by
    us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which
    have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer
    Intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions
    about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and
    investigations and costs and expenses we will incur. We make
    these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of
    such claims, litigation and investigations and of the amount of
    such costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued
    operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to
    us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether
    and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular
    leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill
    our financial and other obligations under the leases, how
    particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what
    mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any
    liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on
    past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and
    the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We
    believe that our reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most
    likely outcomes arising out of the Computer Intrusion and the
    leases relating to discontinued operations and that the reserves
    should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will
    incur. However, actual results may differ from our current
    estimates, and such differences could be material. We may
    decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for
    developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other
    factors.

Loss contingencies:

Certain conditions may exist
    as of the date the financial statements are issued that may
    result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or
    more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where
    relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses
    such contingent liabilities, and such assessments inherently
    involve exercises of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
    related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or
    claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel
    assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal
    proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the
    relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
    that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
    liability can be reasonably estimated, then we will accrue for
    the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the
    assessment indicates that a potentially material loss
    contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is



probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, then we will
    disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with
    an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement
    that such loss is not reasonably estimable.

    estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.

FOREIGN
    CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our
    investment in our Canadian and European operations on the
    translation of these foreign operations into the
    U.S. dollar and on purchases by our operations of goods in
    currencies that are not their local currencies. As more fully
    described in Note E to our consolidated financial
    statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions
    with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase
    commitments incurred by these operations with derivative
    financial instruments. During fiscal 2009, we ceased hedging our
    net investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into
    derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic
    exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts
    designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying
    exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are
    creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major
    industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis
    assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency
    exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
    underlying exposures described above as well as the translation
    of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of
    January 30, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an
    adverse movement would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position but could have reduced our
    pre-tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 by
    approximately $42 million.

INTEREST
    RATE RISK

Our cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain lines
    of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest
    rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition,
    changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes
    in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We
    periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost
    of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily
    fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We
    have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical
    10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum
    variable-rate debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments. As of January 30, 2010, the
    analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have
    a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

EQUITY
    PRICE RISK

The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of
    which are invested in equity securities, are subject to the
    risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We allocate
    the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and
    control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in
    general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate,
    credit, and overall market volatility risks. The significant
    decline in the financial markets over the last several years has
    impacted the value of our pension plan assets and the funded
    status of our plan, resulting in increased contributions to the
    plan.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by
    this report pursuant to

Rules 13a-15

and

15d-15

of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
    that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
    the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms;
    and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of implementing possible controls
    and procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Effective January 1, 2010, we implemented a new payroll
    processing system for our domestic business operations within
    the Company which resulted in material changes to our processes
    and procedures affecting internal control over financial
    reporting. Otherwise there were no changes in our internal
    control over financial reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010
    identified in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s
    and Chief Financial Officer’s evaluation that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
    effected by our board of directors, management and other
    personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:

—

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of TJX;

—

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
    TJX are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of TJX; and

—

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
    TJX’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
    assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of published financial
    statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may



become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 30, 2010 based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of January 30, 2010.

(d) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited and reported on our consolidated
    financial statements contained herein, has audited the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 30, 2010, and has issued an attestation
    report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The TJX Companies,
    Inc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of The TJX Companies, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30,
    2010 and January 31, 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended January 30, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
    all material respects, the information set forth therein when
    read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements and the financial
    statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
    over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note K to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January 28,
    2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    bylaws to provide that its fiscal year will end on the Saturday
    nearest to the last day of January of each year. Prior to this
    TJX’s fiscal year ended on the last Saturday of January.
    This change only affects TJX prospectively by shifting the
    timing of its next 53 week fiscal year. The fiscal year
    ended January 30, 2010 (“fiscal 2010”) included
    52 weeks, the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009
    (“fiscal 2009”) included 53 weeks and the fiscal
    year ended January 26, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”)
    included 52 weeks.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts
    discussed refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise
    indicated.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial
    statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America
    (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
    liabilities, at the date of the financial statements as well as
    the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. TJX considers its accounting policies relating
    to inventory valuation, impairments of long-lived assets,
    retirement obligations, share-based compensation, casualty
    insurance, income taxes, reserves for Computer Intrusion related
    costs and for discontinued operations, and loss contingencies to
    be the most significant accounting policies that involve
    management estimates and judgments. Actual amounts could differ
    from those estimates, and such differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the
    time of sale and receipt of merchandise by the customer, net of
    a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based upon
    our historical experience. We defer recognition of a layaway
    sale and its related profit to the accounting period when the
    customer receives the layaway merchandise. Proceeds from the
    sale of store cards as well as the value of store cards issued
    to customers as a result of a return or exchange, are deferred
    until the customers use the cards to acquire merchandise. Based
    on historical experience, we estimate the amount of store cards
    that will not be redeemed (“store card breakage”) and,
    to the extent allowed by local law, these amounts are amortized
    into income over the redemption period. Revenue recognized from
    store card breakage was $7.8 million in fiscal 2010,
    $10.7 million in fiscal 2009 and $10.1 million in
    fiscal 2008.

Consolidated Statements of Income Classifications:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, includes
    the cost of merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory
    and fuel-related derivative contracts; store occupancy costs
    (including real estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs and
    fixed asset depreciation); the costs of operating our
    distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs
    directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs
    related to the buying and tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include store
    payroll and benefit costs; communication costs; credit and check
    expenses; advertising; administrative and field management
    payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate administrative
    costs and depreciation; gains and losses on non-inventory
    related foreign currency exchange contracts; and other
    miscellaneous income and expense items.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

TJX generally considers
    highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments
    with maturities greater than three months but less than one year
    at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments.
    Our investments are primarily high-grade commercial paper,
    institutional money market funds and time deposits with major
    banks.

F-7


Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for
    valuing inventories on the

first-in

first-out basis. We almost exclusively utilize a permanent
    markdown strategy and lower the cost value of the inventory that
    is subject to markdown at the time the retail prices are lowered
    in our stores. We accrue for inventory obligations at the time
    inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by
    TJX. At January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009,
    in-transit inventory included in merchandise inventories was
    $396.8 million and $329.9 million, respectively.
    Comparable amounts were reflected in accounts payable at those
    dates.

Common Stock and Equity:

Equity transactions
    consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
    our stock repurchase programs and the amortization of expense
    and issuance of common stock under our stock incentive plan. In
    fiscal 2010, we also issued shares upon conversion of
    convertible notes called for redemption, discussed in
    Note D. Under our stock repurchase programs we repurchase
    our common stock on the open market. The par value of the shares
    repurchased is charged to common stock with the excess of the
    purchase price over par first charged against any available
    additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) and the balance
    charged to retained earnings. Due to the high volume of
    repurchases over the past several years, we have no remaining
    balance in APIC in any of the years presented. All shares
    repurchased have been retired.

Shares issued under TJX’s stock incentive plan are issued
    from authorized but unissued shares, and proceeds received are
    recorded by increasing common stock for the par value of the
    shares with the excess over par added to APIC. Income tax
    benefits upon the expensing of options result in the creation of
    a deferred tax asset, while income tax benefits due to the
    exercise of stock options reduce deferred tax assets to the
    extent that an asset for the related grant has been created. Any
    tax benefits greater than the deferred tax assets created at the
    time of expensing the options are credited to APIC; any
    deficiencies in the tax benefits are debited to APIC to the
    extent a pool for such deficiencies exists. In the absence of a
    pool any deficiencies are realized in the related periods’
    statements of income through the provision for income taxes. Any
    excess income tax benefits are included in cash flows from
    financing activities in the statements of cash flows. The par
    value of restricted stock awards is also added to common stock
    when the stock is issued, generally at grant date. The fair
    value of the restricted stock awards in excess of par value is
    added to APIC as the awards are amortized into earnings over the
    related vesting periods. Upon the call of our convertible notes
    most holders of the notes chose to convert into TJX common
    stock. When converted the face value of the convertible notes
    less unamortized debt discount was relieved, common stock was
    credited with the par value of the shares issued and the excess
    of the carrying value of the convertible notes over par was
    added to APIC.

Share-Based Compensation:

TJX accounts for share
    based compensation in accordance with U.S. GAAP whereby it
    estimates the fair value of each option grant on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. See
    Note H for a detailed discussion of share-based
    compensation.

Interest:

TJX’s interest expense (income) is
    presented as a net amount. The following is a summary of net
    interest.

We capitalize interest during the active construction period of
    major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the
    cost of the related assets.

Depreciation and Amortization:

For financial
    reporting purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and
    amortization of property by the use of the straight-line method
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are
    depreciated over 33 years. Leasehold costs and improvements
    are generally amortized over their useful life or the committed
    lease term (typically 10 years), whichever is shorter.
    Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to
    10 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for
    property was $435.8 million for fiscal 2010,
    $398.0 million for fiscal 2009

F-8


and $364.2 million for fiscal 2008. Amortization expense
    for property held under a capital lease was $2.2 million in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Maintenance and repairs are charged
    to expense as incurred. Significant costs incurred for
    internally developed software are capitalized and amortized over
    3 to 10 years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of
    disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are
    eliminated and any gain or loss is included in income.
    Pre-opening costs, including rent, are expensed as incurred.

Lease Accounting:

TJX begins to record rent
    expense when it takes possession of a store, which is typically
    30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store and
    generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term, as
    specified in the lease.

Goodwill and Tradename:

Goodwill is primarily the
    excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
    minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
    83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
    T.J. Maxx chain. In addition, goodwill includes the excess of
    cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of
    Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill totaled $72.1 million as of January 30, 2010,
    $71.8 million as of January 31, 2009 and
    $72.2 million as of January 26, 2008. Goodwill is
    considered to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not
    amortized. Changes in goodwill are attributable to the effect of
    exchange rate changes on Winners’ reported goodwill.

Tradename is the value assigned to the name
    “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 as part of
    the acquisition of the Marshalls chain. The value of the
    tradename was determined by the discounted present value of
    assumed after-tax royalty payments, offset by a reduction for
    their pro-rata share of negative goodwill acquired. The
    Marshalls tradename is carried at a value of $107.7 million
    and is considered to have an indefinite life.

TJX occasionally acquires or licenses other trademarks to be
    used in connection with private label merchandise. Such
    trademarks are included in other assets and are amortized to
    cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, over their
    useful life, generally from 7 to 10 years.

Goodwill, tradename and trademarks, and the related amortization
    if any, are included in the respective operating segment to
    which they relate. There is no accumulated impairment related to
    our goodwill, tradename or trademarks.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and
    Tradename

: TJX evaluates its long-lived assets and
    assets with indefinite lives (other than Goodwill and Tradename)
    for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable, and at least annually in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. An impairment exists when the undiscounted cash
    flow of an asset or asset group is less than the carrying cost
    of that asset or asset group. The evaluation for long-lived
    assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash
    flows, which is generally at the individual store level. If
    indicators of impairment are identified, an undiscounted cash
    flow analysis is performed to determine if an impairment exists.
    The

store-by-store

evaluations did not indicate any recoverability issues (for any
    of our continuing operations) during the past three fiscal years.

Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred and
    at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, by
    comparing the carrying value of the related reporting unit to
    its fair value. An impairment exists when this analysis, using
    typical valuation models such as the discounted cash flow
    method, shows that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
    than the carrying cost of the reporting

F-9


unit. The fair value of our reporting units, using typical
    valuation models such as the discounted cash flow method, is
    considerably higher than the book values, and no impairment has
    occurred in the last three fiscal years.

Tradename is also tested for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    the tradename may exceed its fair value and at least annually in
    the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Testing is performed by
    comparing the discounted present value of assumed after-tax
    royalty payments to the carrying value of the tradename. No
    impairment has occurred in the last three fiscal years.

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs
    as incurred. Advertising expense was $227.5 million for
    fiscal 2010, $254.0 million for fiscal 2009 and
    $255.0 million for fiscal 2008.

Foreign Currency Translation:

TJX’s foreign
    assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at
    fiscal year end exchange rates with resulting translation gains
    and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Activity of
    the foreign operations that affects the statements of income and
    cash flows is translated at average exchange rates prevailing
    during the fiscal year.

Loss Contingencies:

TJX records a reserve for loss
    contingencies when it is both probable that a loss has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. TJX
    reviews pending litigation and other contingencies at least
    quarterly and adjusts the reserve for such contingencies for
    changes in probable and reasonably estimable losses. TJX
    includes an estimate for related legal costs at the time such
    costs are both probable and reasonably estimable.

New Accounting Standards:

In June 2009, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (“Codification”), which was effective on July 1,
    2009, to become the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP
    recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental
    entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under authority of
    U.S. federal securities laws are also sources of
    authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. Generally, the
    Codification is not expected to change U.S. GAAP. All other
    accounting literature excluded from the Codification will be
    considered non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for
    financial statements issued for interim and annual periods
    ending after September 15, 2009. We adopted the new
    standards for our fiscal year ending January 30, 2010.

In June 2009, FASB issued guidance related to accounting for
    transfers of financial assets, in order to improve the
    relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of
    the information that a reporting entity provides in its
    financial reports about a transfer of financial assets; the
    effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows; and the transferor’s
    continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. This
    guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting
    entity’s first annual reporting period that begins after
    November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first
    annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting
    periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. This
    guidance must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the
    effective date. TJX expects that the adoption of this guidance
    will have no impact on its financial statements.

Reclassifications:

For comparative purposes TJX
    reclassified $34.4 million in the fiscal 2009 and
    $42.3 million in the fiscal 2008 Consolidated Statements of
    Income from “selling, general and administrative
    expenses” to “cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs” to be consistent with the fiscal 2010
    presentation. This reclassification had no impact on net income
    or total cash flows as previously reported.

B.

Provision
    for Computer Intrusion related costs

TJX incurred losses as a result of an unauthorized intrusion or
    intrusions (the intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the
    “Computer Intrusion”) into portions of its computer
    system, which was discovered late in fiscal 2007 and in which
    TJX believes customer data were stolen. During the first six
    months of fiscal 2008, we expensed pre-tax costs of
    $37.8 million for costs we incurred related to the Computer
    Intrusion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established
    a pre-tax reserve of $178.1 million to reflect our
    estimation of probable losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP
    with respect to the Computer Intrusion and recorded a pre-tax
    charge in that amount. We reduced the Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs by $30.5 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $18.9 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of negotiations,
    settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated
    losses. Our reserve of $23.5 million at January 30,
    2010 reflected

F-10


our current estimation of total potential cash liabilities from
    pending litigation, proceedings, investigations and other
    claims, as well as legal, ongoing monitoring and other costs and
    expenses, arising from the Computer Intrusion. As an estimate,
    our reserve is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may
    vary from our current estimate, and such variations may be
    material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve
    to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of
    litigation, claims and investigations and related expenses,
    insurance proceeds and changes in our estimates.

C.

Discontinued
    Operations

Sale of Bob’s Stores:

In fiscal 2009, TJX
    sold Bob’s Stores and recorded as a component of
    discontinued operations a loss on disposal (including expenses
    relating to the sale) of $19.0 million, net of tax benefits
    of $13.0 million. The net carrying value of Bob’s
    Stores assets sold was $33 million, which consisted
    primarily of merchandise inventory of $56 million, offset
    by merchandise payable of $21 million. The loss on disposal
    reflects sales proceeds of $7.2 million as well as expenses
    of $5.8 million relating to the sale. TJX remains
    contingently liable on 7 of the Bob’s Stores leases which
    are discussed in Note N to the consolidated financial
    statements.

TJX also reclassified the operating results of Bob’s Stores
    for all periods prior to the sale as a component of discontinued
    operations. The following table presents the net sales, segment
    profit (loss) and after-tax loss from operations reclassified to

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised
    gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the
    notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. During
    fiscal 2010, TJX called for the redemption of these notes at the
    original issue price plus accrued original issue discount, and
    462,057 of such notes with a carrying value of
    $365.1 million were converted into 15.1 million shares
    of TJX common stock at a rate of 32.667 shares per note.
    TJX paid $2.3 million to redeem the remaining 2,886 notes
    outstanding that were not converted. Prior to fiscal 2010, a
    total of 52,557 notes were either converted into common shares
    of TJX or put back to the Company.

On April 7, 2009, TJX issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.95% ten-year notes and used the proceeds
    from the 6.95% notes offering to repurchase additional
    common stock under its stock repurchase program in fiscal 2010.
    Also in April 2009, prior to the issuance of the
    6.95% notes, TJX entered into a rate-lock agreement to
    hedge the underlying treasury rate of those notes. The cost of
    this agreement is being amortized to interest expense over the
    term of the 6.95% notes and results in an effective fixed
    rate of 7.00% on those notes.

On July 23, 2009, TJX issued $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of 4.20% six-year notes. TJX used a portion of
    the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance its
    C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009,
    prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder,
    together with funds from operations, to repay its
    $200 million 7.45% notes due December 15, 2009,
    at maturity. Also in July 2009, prior to the issuance of the
    4.20% notes, TJX entered into a rate-lock agreement to
    hedge the underlying treasury rate on $250 million of those
    notes. The cost of this agreement is being amortized to interest
    expense over the term of the 4.20% notes and results in an
    effective fixed rate of 4.19% on the notes.

TJX has a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing
    May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility
    maturing May 2011. TJX pays six basis points annually on the
    committed amounts under each of the credit facilities. These
    agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have
    various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio
    of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as back up to
    TJX’s commercial paper program. As of January 30,
    2010, there were no outstanding amounts under these credit
    facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term
    borrowings outstanding was $165.0 million during fiscal
    2010 and $222.0 million in fiscal 2009. The weighted
    average interest rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was
    1.01% in fiscal 2010. We did not borrow under these credit
    facilities during fiscal 2008.

As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009,
    TJX’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit
    facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million
    facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter
    of credit facility. There were no borrowings under the Canadian
    credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal
    2009. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit
    line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal
    2008. There were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit
    line for operating expenses at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal
    2009. As of January 30, 2010, TJX Europe had a credit line
    of £20 million. The maximum amount outstanding under
    this U.K. line was £1.9 million in fiscal 2010,
    £6.1 million in fiscal 2009 and
    £16.4 million in fiscal 2008. There were no
    outstanding borrowings on this U.K. credit line at the end of
    fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009.

E.

Financial
    Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage its cost of
    borrowing and to manage its exposure to changes in fuel costs
    and foreign currency exchange rates. TJX recognizes all
    derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
    statements of financial position and measures those instruments
    at fair value. Changes to the fair value of derivative contracts
    that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in
    earnings in the period of the change. For derivatives that
    qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the
    derivatives are either recorded in shareholders’ equity as
    a component of other comprehensive income or are recognized
    currently in earnings, along with an offsetting adjustment
    against the basis of the item being hedged. Effective in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, TJX no longer entered into
    contracts to hedge its net investments in foreign subsidiaries
    and settled all existing contracts. As a result, there were no
    net investment contracts as of January 30, 2010 or
    January 31, 2009.

Interest Rate Contracts:

During fiscal 2004, TJX
    entered into interest rate swaps on $100 million of the
    $200 million ten-year notes outstanding at that time,
    effectively converting the interest on that portion of the
    unsecured notes from fixed to a floating rate of interest
    indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate. The interest rate swaps
    settled in December 2009. Under these swaps, TJX paid a specific
    variable interest rate and received the fixed rate applicable to
    the underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swaps
    was accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the
    interest expense accrued on the fixed-rate debt. The interest
    rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges on the
    underlying debt. The fair value of the contracts, excluding the
    net interest accrual, amounted to an asset of $1.6 million
    as of January 31, 2009 and an asset of $1.2 million at
    January 26, 2008. The valuation of the swaps resulted in an
    offsetting fair value adjustment to the debt hedged.
    Accordingly, current installments of long-term debt was
    increased by $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 and by
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2008. The average effective interest
    rate on $100 million of the 7.45% unsecured notes,
    inclusive of the effect of hedging activity, was approximately
    4.04% in fiscal 2010, 6.54% in fiscal 2009 and 8.77% in fiscal
    2008.

Concurrent with the issuance of the C$235 million
    three-year note in fiscal 2006, TJX entered an interest rate
    swap on the principal amount of the note effectively converting
    the interest on the note from floating to a fixed rate. In
    January 2009 this interest rate swap settled, one year before
    the maturity date of the underlying debt, which was extended one
    year to January 2010 and subsequently repaid in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2010 before its scheduled maturity. Under this
    swap TJX paid a specified fixed interest rate and received the
    floating rate applicable to the underlying debt. The interest
    income/expense on the swap was accrued as earned and recorded as
    an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on the
    floating-rate debt. The interest rate swap was designated as a
    cash flow hedge of the underlying debt. The fair value of the
    interest rate swap, excluding the net interest accrual, amounted
    to an asset of $1.1 million (C$1.1 million) as of
    January 26, 2008. The valuation of the swap resulted in an
    adjustment to other comprehensive income of a similar amount.
    The average effective interest rate on the note, inclusive of
    the effect of hedging activity, was approximately 4.50% in both
    fiscal 2009 and 2008.

Diesel Fuel Contracts:

During fiscal 2010, TJX
    entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its notional
    diesel requirements for fiscal 2011, based on the diesel fuel
    consumed by independent freight carriers transporting the
    Company’s inventory. These economic hedges relate to 10% of
    our notional diesel requirements in the second quarter of fiscal
    2011 and 20% of our notional diesel requirements in the third
    and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011. These diesel fuel hedge
    agreements will settle during the last three quarters of fiscal
    2011 and expire in February 2011. During fiscal 2009, TJX
    entered into agreements to hedge approximately 30% of its
    notional diesel fuel requirements for fiscal 2010, which settled
    throughout the year and terminated in February 2010. Independent
    freight carriers transporting the Company’s inventory
    charge TJX a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases
    as incurred by the carrier. The hedge agreements are designed to
    mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel pricing (and the
    resulting per mile surcharges payable by TJX) by setting a fixed
    price per gallon for the year. TJX elected not to apply hedge
    accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the fair
    value of the hedge agreements resulted in a gain of
    $4.5 million in fiscal 2010 and a loss of $4.9 million
    in fiscal 2009 both of which are reflected in earnings as a
    component of cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.

F-13


Foreign Currency Contracts:

TJX enters into
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain economic
    hedges on firm U.S. dollar and Euro denominated merchandise
    purchase commitments made by T.K. Maxx (United Kingdom,
    Ireland, Germany and Poland), Winners (Canada) and Marmaxx.
    These commitments are typically twelve months or less in
    duration. The contracts outstanding at January 30, 2010
    cover certain commitments for the four quarters of fiscal 2011.
    TJX elected not to apply hedge accounting rules to these
    contracts in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. The
    change in the fair value of these contracts resulted in income
    of $494,000 in fiscal 2010, a loss of $2.3 million in
    fiscal 2009 and income of $6.6 million in fiscal 2008 and
    is included in earnings as a component of cost of sales,
    including buying and occupancy costs.

Until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, TJX entered into
    foreign currency forward and swap contracts in both Canadian
    dollars and British pound sterling and accounted for them as
    hedges of the net investment in and between foreign subsidiaries
    or cash flow hedges of Winners long-term intercompany debt. TJX
    applied hedge accounting to these hedge contracts of our
    investment in foreign subsidiaries, and changes in fair value of
    these contracts, as well as gains and losses upon settlement,
    were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    offsetting changes in the cumulative foreign translation
    adjustments of the foreign subsidiaries. The change in fair
    value of the contracts designated as hedges of the investment in
    foreign subsidiaries resulted in a gain of $68.8 million,
    net of income taxes, in fiscal 2009, and a loss of
    $15.8 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2008. The
    ineffective portion of the net investment hedges resulted in
    pre-tax charges to the income statement of $2.2 million in
    fiscal 2009 and $9.1 million in fiscal 2008. The change in
    the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment resulted
    in a loss of $76.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal
    2010, a gain of $171.2 million, net of income taxes, in
    fiscal 2009, and a gain of $21.0 million, net of income
    taxes, in fiscal 2008. Amounts included in other comprehensive
    income relating to cash flow hedges were reclassified to
    earnings as the underlying exposure on the debt had an impact on
    earnings. The net amount reclassified from other comprehensive
    income to the income statement in fiscal 2009 related to cash
    flow hedges was $677,368, net of income taxes. The net loss
    recognized in fiscal 2008 related to cash flow hedges was
    $1.1 million, net of income taxes.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts, generally designated
    as fair value hedges, to hedge intercompany debt and
    intercompany interest payable. The changes in fair value of
    these contracts are recorded in selling, general and
    administrative expenses and are offset by marking the underlying
    item to fair value in the same period. Upon settlement, the
    realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by the
    realized gains and losses of the underlying item in selling,
    general and administrative expenses. There were no such
    contracts outstanding as of January 30, 2010. The net
    impact on the income statement of hedging activity related to
    these intercompany payables was income of $3.7 million in
    fiscal 2010, expense of $1.7 million in fiscal 2009 and
    income of $2.6 million in fiscal 2008.

The counterparties to the forward exchange contracts and swap
    agreements are major international financial institutions, and
    the contracts contain rights of offset, which minimize
    TJX’s exposure to credit loss in the event of
    nonperformance by one of the counterparties. TJX is not required
    by counterparties, and TJX does not require that counterparties,
    maintain collateral for these contracts. TJX periodically
    monitors its position and the credit ratings of the
    counterparties and does not anticipate losses resulting from the
    nonperformance of these institutions.

Disclosures
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    (exit price). U.S. GAAP classifies the inputs used to measure
    fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1:

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities.

Level 2:

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
    liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
    active, or

inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
    asset or liability.

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

TJX endeavors to utilize the best available information in
    measuring fair value and classifies financial assets and
    liabilities in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
    that is significant to the fair value measurement. TJX has

F-16


determined that its financial assets and liabilities are
    generally classified within level 1 or level 2 in the
    fair value hierarchy. The following table sets forth TJX’s
    financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair
    value on a recurring basis:

The fair value of TJX’s general corporate debt, including
    current installments, was estimated by obtaining market quotes
    given the trading levels of other bonds of the same general
    issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The fair value
    of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes was estimated
    by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of long-term debt at
    January 30, 2010 was $862.3 million versus a carrying
    value of $774.3 million. The fair value of the current
    installments of long-term debt at January 31, 2009 was
    $399.9 million versus a carrying value of
    $392.9 million. The fair value of the subordinated notes as
    of January 31, 2009, was $358.3 million versus a
    carrying value of $365.6 million. These estimates do not
    necessarily reflect provisions or restrictions in the various
    debt agreements that might affect TJX’s ability to settle
    these obligations.

Our cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair
    value, due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Investments designed to meet obligations under our executive
    savings plan are invested in securities traded in active markets
    and carried at unadjusted quoted prices.

As a result of its international operating and financing
    activities, TJX is exposed to market risks from changes in
    interest and foreign currency exchange rates, which may
    adversely affect its operating results and financial position.
    When deemed appropriate, we minimize risk from interest and
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial
    instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading
    or other speculative purposes and TJX does not use leveraged
    derivative financial instruments. The forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are valued using
    broker quotations which include observable market information.
    TJX makes no adjustments to quotes or prices obtained from
    brokers or pricing services but does assess the credit risk of
    counterparties and will adjust final valuations when
    appropriate. Where independent pricing services provide fair
    values, TJX obtains an understanding of the methods used in
    pricing. As such, these derivative instruments are classified
    within level 2.

G.

Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related to its
    continuing operations for the rental of real estate and fixtures
    and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating leases
    with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for one or
    more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases, acquired in
    fiscal 1996, had then remaining terms ranging up to twenty-five
    years. T.K. Maxx leases are generally for ten to twenty-five
    years with ten-year kick-out options. Many of our leases contain
    escalation clauses and early termination penalties. In addition,
    we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes
    and other operating expenses including, in some cases, rentals
    based on a percentage of sales. These expenses in the aggregate
    were approximately one-third of the total minimum rent in fiscal
    2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

The capital lease relates to a 283,000-square-foot addition to
    TJX’s home office facility. Rental payments commenced
    June 1, 2001, and we recognized a capital lease asset and
    related obligation equal to the present value of the lease
    payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for continuing operations
    amounted to $962.0 million for fiscal 2010,
    $936.6 million for fiscal 2009 and $875.6 million for
    fiscal 2008. Rental expense includes contingent rent and is
    reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent paid was
    $13.0 million in fiscal 2010, $8.3 million in fiscal
    2009 and $9.7 million in fiscal 2008. Sublease income was
    $1.3 million in fiscal 2010, $2.1 million in fiscal
    2009 and $2.9 million in fiscal 2008. The total net present
    value of TJX’s minimum operating lease obligations
    approximated $4,450.2 million as of January 30, 2010.

TJX had outstanding letters of credit totaling
    $37.6 million as of January 30, 2010 and
    $32.0 million as of January 31, 2009. Letters of
    credit are issued by TJX primarily for the purchase of inventory.

H.

Stock
    Incentive Plan

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which options and other
    share based awards may be granted to its directors, officers and
    key employees. This plan has been approved by TJX’s
    shareholders, and all stock compensation awards are made under
    this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with shareholder
    approval, provides for the issuance of up to 160.9 million
    shares with 22.7 million shares available for future grants
    as of January 30, 2010. TJX issues shares from authorized
    but unissued common stock.

Total compensation cost related to share-based compensation was
    $33.5 million net of income taxes of $21.6 million in
    fiscal 2010, $31.2 million net of income taxes of
    $20.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $37.0 million net of
    income taxes of $20.3 million in fiscal 2008.

As of January 30, 2010, there was $87.2 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan.
    That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of two years.

Options for the purchase of common stock have been granted at
    100% of market price on the grant date and generally vest in
    thirds over a three-year period starting one year after the
    grant, and have a ten-year term.

Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied
    volatility from traded options on our stock, and historical
    volatility during a term approximating the expected term of the
    option granted. We use historical data to estimate option
    exercise, employee termination behavior and dividend yield
    within the valuation model. Employee groups and option
    characteristics are considered separately for valuation purposes
    when applicable. No such distinctions existed during the fiscal
    years presented. The expected option life represents an estimate
    of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding
    based upon historical exercise trends. The risk-free rate is for
    periods within the contractual life of the option based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Other
    Awards:

TJX has issued performance-based restricted
    stock awards under the Stock Incentive Plan which are issued at
    no cost to the recipient of the award and have restrictions that
    generally lapse over one to four years from date of grant when
    and if specified performance criteria are met. The grant date
    fair value of the award is charged to income ratably over the
    period during which these awards vest. The fair value of

F-19


the awards is determined at date of grant and assumes that
    performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met,
    no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized
    compensation cost is reversed.

A summary of the status of our nonvested performance-based
    restricted stock and changes during fiscal 2010 is presented

There were 470,000 shares of performance-based restricted
    stock, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $25.91,
    granted in fiscal 2010; 173,000 shares with a weighted
    average grant date fair value of $33.49 were granted in fiscal
    2009 and 200,000 shares with a weighted average grant date
    fair value of $28.04 were granted in fiscal 2008. The fair value
    of performance-based restricted stock that vested was
    $6.7 million in fiscal 2010, $5.9 million in fiscal
    2009 and $3.9 million in fiscal 2008.

TJX also awards deferred shares to its outside directors under
    the Stock Incentive Plan. The outside directors are awarded two
    annual deferred share awards, each representing shares of TJX
    common stock valued at $50,000. One award vests immediately and
    is payable, with accumulated dividends, in stock at the earlier
    of separation from service as a director or change of control.
    The second award vests based on service as a director until the
    annual meeting that follows the award and is payable, with
    accumulated dividends, in stock at vesting date, unless an
    irrevocable advance election is made whereby it is payable at
    the same time as the first award. As of the end of fiscal 2010,
    a total of 174,577 deferred shares were outstanding under the
    plan.

Capital
    Stock and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

In December 2009, we completed a
    $1 billion stock repurchase program which began in fiscal
    2009 and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock
    repurchase program approved in September 2009. We repurchased
    and retired 27.0 million shares of our common stock at a
    cost of $949.9 million during fiscal 2010. TJX reflects
    stock repurchases in its financial statements on a
    “settlement” basis. We had cash expenditures under our
    repurchase programs of $944.8 million in fiscal 2010,
    $751.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $940.2 million in
    fiscal 2008, funded primarily by cash generated from operations.
    We repurchased 26.9 million shares in fiscal 2010,
    24.3 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 33.0 million
    shares in fiscal 2008. As of January 30, 2010, on a
    “trade date” basis, we had repurchased
    5.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
    $205.0 million under the $1 billion stock repurchase
    program authorized in September 2009. All shares repurchased
    under our stock repurchase programs have been retired.

In February 2010, TJX’s Board of Directors approved a new
    stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to
    an additional $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to
    time.

TJX has five million shares of authorized but unissued preferred
    stock, $1 par value.

In April 2009, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon
    convertible subordinated notes. There were 462,057 of such notes
    with a carrying value of $365.1 million that were converted
    into 15.1 million shares of TJX common stock at a
    conversion rate of 32.667 shares per note. TJX paid
    $2.3 million to redeem the remaining 2,886 notes
    outstanding that were not converted.

The weighted average common shares for the diluted earnings per
    share calculation exclude the impact of outstanding stock
    options if the assumed proceeds per share of the option is in
    excess of the related fiscal year’s average price of
    TJX’s common stock. Such options are excluded because they
    would have an antidilutive effect. Excluded were
    9.5 million options at January 30, 2010,
    5.2 million at January 31, 2009 and 5.7 million
    at January 26, 2008.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments included in
    shareholders’ equity amounted to a loss of
    $76.3 million, net of related tax effect of
    $21.6 million, as of January 30, 2010; a loss of
    $152.9 million, net of related tax effect of
    $2.6 million, as of January 31, 2009; and a gain of
    $17.8 million, net of related tax effect of
    $23.7 million, as of January 26, 2008. Cumulative
    gains and losses on derivatives that hedged our net investment
    in foreign operations and deferred gains and losses on cash flow
    hedges that have been recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income amounted to a gain of $27.3 million,
    net of related tax effects of $18.2 million at both
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and a loss of
    $42.1 million, net of related tax effects of
    $28.1 million at January 26, 2008.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, TJX is required to recognize
    the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans which are
    discussed in Note L. Cumulative loss adjustments included
    in accumulated other comprehensive income was
    $85.2 million, net of related tax effects of
    $56.8 million at January 30, 2010, $92.2 million,
    net of related tax effects of $61.5 million at
    January 31, 2009, and $4.4 million, net of related tax

The fiscal 2010 net deferred tax liability is presented on
    the balance sheet as a current asset of $122.5 million and
    a non-current liability of $192.4 million. For fiscal 2009,
    the net deferred tax asset is presented on the balance sheet as
    a current asset of $135.7 million and a non-current
    liability of $127.0 million. TJX has provided for deferred
    U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings from its Winners
    Canadian subsidiary, its Marshalls Puerto Rico subsidiary and
    its Italian subsidiary through January 30, 2010. All
    earnings of TJX’s other foreign subsidiaries are considered
    indefinitely reinvested and no U.S. deferred taxes have
    been provided on those earnings. The net deferred tax
    (liability) asset summarized above includes deferred taxes
    relating to temporary differences at our foreign operations and
    amounted to an $18.9 million net liability as of
    January 30, 2010 and a $19.9 million net liability as
    of January 31, 2009.

In fiscal 2009, TJX’s HomeGoods subsidiary utilized a
    Puerto Rico net operating loss carryforward of approximately
    $1.1 million which had not been previously recognized.
    There were no further Puerto Rico net operating losses as of the
    fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. TJX’s German
    subsidiary, which is treated as a branch for U.S. tax
    purposes, incurred

F-22


net operating losses of $11.4 million in fiscal 2010,
    $15.0 million in fiscal 2009 and $14.4 million in
    fiscal 2008 for tax and financial reporting purposes. The losses
    were fully utilized in each year to reduce TJX’s current
    U.S. taxable income. Any future utilization of the losses
    in Germany will result in a corresponding amount of taxable
    income for U.S. tax purposes.

TJX established valuation allowances against certain deferred
    tax assets which may not be realized in future years. The amount
    of the valuation allowances was $3.9 million as of
    January 30, 2010 and $6.2 million as of
    January 31, 2009.

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate was 37.8% for
    fiscal 2010, 36.9% for fiscal 2009, and 37.9% for fiscal 2008.
    The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income
    tax rate and TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate is
    reconciled below:

The increase in TJX’s effective state income tax rate for
    fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed
    to the settlement, in fiscal 2009, of several state tax audits
    and the resulting reduction to our reserves for uncertain tax
    positions. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, TJX adopted the
    provisions for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return that affect amounts
    reported in the financial statements. As a result of the
    implementation, TJX recognized a charge of approximately
    $27.2 million to its retained earnings balance at the
    beginning of fiscal 2008. TJX had net unrecognized tax benefits
    of $121.0 million as of January 30, 2010,
    $129.9 million as of January 31, 2009 and
    $140.7 million as of January 26, 2008.

    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
    items that will not impact future effective tax rates upon
    recognition. These items amount to $57.6 million as of
    January 30, 2010, $49.3 million as of January 31,
    2009 and $67.8 million as of January 26, 2008.

TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income
    tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In
    nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years through fiscal 2001 are
    no longer subject to examination.

TJX’s accounting policy is to classify interest and
    penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax
    expense. The amount of interest and penalties expensed was
    $7.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010,
    $15.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 and
    $16.2 million for the year ended January 26, 2008. The
    accrued amounts for interest and penalties are
    $50.6 million as of January 30, 2010,
    $51.1 million as of January 31, 2009 and
    $52.5 million as of January 26, 2008.

F-23


Based on the final resolution of tax examinations, judicial or
    administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations
    of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other
    resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions; it is reasonably
    possible that unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax
    positions taken on previously filed tax returns may change
    materially from those represented on the financial statements as
    of January 30, 2010. During the next twelve months, it
    is reasonably possible that such circumstances may occur that
    would have a material effect on previously unrecognized tax
    benefits. As a result, the total net amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits may decrease, which would reduce the provision for
    taxes on earnings by a range estimated at $1.0 million to
    $49.0 million.

L.

Pension
    Plans and Other Retirement Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a funded defined benefit
    retirement plan covering the majority of its full-time
    U.S. employees. As a result of an amendment to the plan,
    employees hired after February 1, 2006 do not participate
    in this plan but are eligible to receive enhanced employer
    contributions to their 401(k) plans. This plan amendment has not
    had a material impact on pension expense in the periods
    presented, but is expected to reduce net periodic pension costs
    gradually in subsequent years due to a reduction in the number
    of participants. Employees who had attained twenty-one years of
    age and completed one year of service prior to amendment were,
    and remain, covered under the plan. No employee contributions
    are required, and benefits are based on compensation earned in
    each year of service. Our funded defined benefit retirement plan
    assets are invested in domestic and international equity and
    fixed income securities, both directly and through investment
    funds. The plan does not invest in the securities of TJX. TJX
    also has an unfunded supplemental retirement plan which covers
    certain key employees and provides additional retirement
    benefits based on average compensation for certain of those
    employees.

Presented below is financial information relating to TJX’s
    funded defined benefit retirement plan (funded plan) and its
    unfunded supplemental pension plan (unfunded plan) for the

The consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the

    $123.5 million at January 30, 2010 is reflected on the
    balance sheet as of that date as a current liability of
    $3.8 million and a long-term liability of
    $119.7 million.

The combined net accrued liability of $233.7 million at
    January 31, 2009 is reflected on the balance sheet as of
    that date as a current liability of $13.1 million and a
    long-term liability of $220.6 million.

The estimated prior service cost that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost in fiscal 2011 for the unfunded plan is $81,000.
    There is no estimated amortization for the funded plan. The
    estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost in fiscal 2011 is $10.8 million for the funded
    plan and $2.3 million for the unfunded plan.

    Pension Liability Index. TJX develops its long-term rate of
    return assumption by evaluating input from professional advisors
    taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and
    long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions.

TJX made aggregate cash contributions of $147.9 million in
    fiscal 2010, $2.8 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $27.5 million in fiscal 2008 to the defined benefit
    retirement plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments

F-25


under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. The cash
    contributions made in fiscal 2009 were solely to fund current
    benefit and expense payments under the unfunded supplemental
    retirement plan. Through fiscal 2008, our funding policy for the
    funded plan was to fund any required contribution to the plan at
    the full funding limitation and generally to fund contributions
    in excess of any required contribution so as to fully fund the
    accumulated benefit obligation to the extent such contribution
    is allowed for tax purposes. As a result of voluntary funding
    contributions made in prior years, there was no required funding
    during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, the Pension Protection Act
    (PPA) became effective and TJX’s policy became to fund, at
    a minimum, the amount required to maintain a funded status of
    75% to 80% of the pension liability as defined by the PPA. As a
    result of funding in fiscal 2010, we do not anticipate any
    required funding in fiscal 2011 for the defined benefit
    retirement plan. We anticipate making contributions of
    $3.8 million to fund current benefit and expense payments
    under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan in fiscal 2011.

Pension plan assets are reported at fair value. Investments in
    equity securities traded on a national securities exchange are
    valued at the composite close price, as reported in the Wall
    Street Journal, as of the financial statement date. This
    information is provided by the independent pricing services IDC
    and Merrill Lynch.

Certain corporate and government bonds are valued at the closing
    price reported in the active market in which the bond is traded.
    Other bonds are valued based on yields currently available on
    comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
    When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar
    bonds, the bond is valued under a discounted cash flows approach
    that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of
    similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks
    that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks.
    All bonds are priced by IDC except for mortgage-backed pools
    which are priced by Merrill Lynch Pricing Service.

The investments in the limited partnerships are stated at the
    fair value of the Plan’s partnership interest based on
    information supplied by the partnerships as compared to
    financial statements of the limited partnership or other fair
    value information as determined by management. Cash equivalents
    are stated at cost which approximates fair value. The

F-27


market value of the investments in the common/collective trusts
    are determined based on net asset value as reported by their
    fund managers.

The following is a summary of our target allocation for plan
    assets along with the actual allocation of plan assets as of the

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
    equities and fixed income investments is used to seek to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets with a prudent
    level of risk. Risks are sought to be mitigated through asset
    diversification and the use of multiple investment managers.
    Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis
    through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability
    measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
    eligible U.S. employees. Assets under the plan totaled
    $676.4 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $529.5 million as of December 31, 2008 and are
    invested in a variety of funds. Employees may contribute up to
    50% of eligible pay, subject to limitation. TJX matches employee
    contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at rates ranging from
    25% to 50%, based upon TJX’s performance. Employees hired
    after February 1, 2006 are eligible for participation in
    the 401(k) plan with an enhanced matching formula beginning five
    years after hire date. TJX contributed $13.3 million in
    fiscal 2010, $8.6 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $10.2 million in fiscal 2008 to the 401(k) plan. Employees
    cannot invest their contributions in the TJX stock fund option
    in the 401(k) plan, and may elect to invest up to only 50% of
    TJX’s contribution in the TJX stock fund. The TJX stock
    fund has no other trading restrictions. The TJX stock fund
    represents 4.5% of plan investments at December 31, 2009,
    3.3% at December 31, 2008 and 3.5% at December 31,
    2007.

TJX also has a nonqualified savings plan for certain
    U.S. employees. TJX matches employee contributions at
    various rates which amounted to $1.9 million in fiscal
    2010, $425,432 in fiscal 2009 and $1.2 million in fiscal
    2008. TJX transfers employee withholdings and the related
    company match to a separate trust designated to fund the future
    obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in a variety
    of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the balance
    sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also maintain
    retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible associates at
    our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed $4.6 million for
    these plans in fiscal 2010, $4.2 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $4.1 million in fiscal 2008.

Postretirement Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
    medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who participate
    in its retirement plan and who retired at age 55 or older
    with ten or more years of service. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, TJX eliminated this benefit for all active
    associates and modified the benefit to cover only retirees
    enrolled in the plan at that time. The plan amendment replaces
    the previous medical benefits with a defined amount (up to
    $35.00 per month) that approximates the cost of enrollment in
    the Medicare Plan for retirees enrolled in the plan at the time
    of modification.

TJX paid $253,000 of benefits in fiscal 2010 and will pay
    similar amounts over the next several years. The post retirement
    medical liability as of January 30, 2010 is estimated at
    $1.6 million, of which $1.4 million is included in
    non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

The amendment to plan benefits in fiscal 2006 resulted in a
    negative plan amendment of $46.8 million which is being
    amortized into income over the average remaining life of the
    active plan participants. The unamortized balance of
    $26.8 million as of January 30, 2010 is included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of which

F-28


$3.8 million will be amortized into income in fiscal 2011.
    During fiscal 2010, there was a pre-tax net benefit of
    $3.4 million reflected in the income statement as it
    relates to this post retirement medical plan.

Discontinued
    Operations Reserve and Related Contingent Liabilities

TJX has a reserve for future obligations of discontinued
    operations that relates primarily to real estate leases
    associated with 34 discontinued A.J. Wright stores as well as
    leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and
    the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below:

The charges against the reserve in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and
    fiscal 2008 related primarily to the closed A.J. Wright stores.
    In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $2.9 million for
    exposure to certain properties related to the sale of Bob’s

F-29


Stores, which was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable
    settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The majority of
    the reserve relates to lease obligations with respect to the
    closure of the A.J. Wright stores and the sale of Bob’s
    Stores. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of
    the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we
    believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an
    original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses,
    after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease
    obligations. The actual net cost of the various lease
    obligations included in the reserve may differ from our initial
    estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease
    obligations may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we
    may incur costs for other leases from former discontinued
    operations, we do not expect to incur any material costs related
    to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts
    estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued
    operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years.
    The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how
    the remaining lease obligations are actually settled.

TJX may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of
    BJ’s Wholesale Club, and on 7 additional Bob’s Stores
    leases both former TJX businesses. Our reserve for discontinued
    operations does not reflect these leases, because we currently
    believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX is
    not probable.

O.

Guarantees
    and Contingent Obligations

TJX has contingent obligations on leases, for which it was a
    lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties
    without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we
    have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or
    guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the
    exception of leases of former businesses for which we have
    reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned
    leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will
    have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have
    sufficient information about these leases to estimate our
    potential contingent obligations under them, which could be
    triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants
    does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of
    these leases.

TJX also has contingent obligations in connection with some
    assigned or sublet properties that TJX is able to estimate. We
    estimate the undiscounted obligations (not reflected in our
    reserves) of leases of closed stores of continuing operations,
    BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bob’s Stores leases (discussed
    in Note N) and properties of our discontinued
    operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not
    fulfill their obligations, is approximately $94 million as
    of January 30, 2010. We believe that most or all of these
    contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent
    they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to
    mitigating factors.

TJX is a party to various agreements under which we may be
    obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of
    warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets
    sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes.
    These obligations are typically limited in time and amount.
    There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with
    respect to these contingent obligations.

P.

Supplemental
    Cash Flows Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent obligations of the
    discontinued operations as discussed in Note N, are
    classified as a reduction in cash provided by continuing
    operations. There are no remaining operating activities relating
    to these operations.

Q.

Segment
    Information

TJX operates five business segments, three in the United States
    and one each in Canada and Europe. Each of our segments has its
    own administrative, buying and merchandising organization and
    distribution network. Of our U.S. based store chains, T.J.
    Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are managed together
    and reported as a single segment and A.J. Wright and HomeGoods
    each is reported as a separate segment. Outside the U.S., our
    store chains in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are under common
    management and reported as the TJX Canada segment, and our store
    chains in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are also under common
    management and reported as the TJX Europe segment.

For fiscal 2010, TJX Canada and TJX Europe accounted for 22% of
    TJX’s net sales, 19% of segment profit and 22% of
    consolidated assets. All of our stores, with the exception of
    HomeGoods and HomeSense, sell family apparel and home fashions.
    The HomeGoods and HomeSense stores offer exclusively home
    fashions. By merchandise category, we derived approximately 61%
    of our sales from clothing (including footwear), 26% from home
    fashions and 13% from jewelry and accessories in fiscal 2010.

TJX evaluates the performance of its segments based on
    “segment profit or loss,” which it defines as pre-tax
    income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer
    Intrusion related costs and interest. “Segment profit or
    loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition,
    this measure of performance should not be considered an
    alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
    activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
    liquidity.
