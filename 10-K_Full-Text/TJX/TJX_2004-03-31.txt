PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are the leading off-price retailer of apparel
and home fashions in the United States and worldwide. Our seven
off-price chains are synergistic in their philosophies and
operating platforms. We offer off-price family apparel and home
fashions through our T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and A.J. Wright chains
in the United States, our Winners chain in Canada and our T.K.
Maxx chain in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We offer
exclusively off-price home fashions through our HomeGoods chain
in the United States and our Canadian HomeSense chain operated
by Winners. The target customer for all of our off-price chains,
except A.J. Wright, is the middle to upper-middle income
shopper, with the same profile as a department or specialty
store customer. A.J. Wright targets a more moderate income
customer. We acquired Bob’s Stores in December 2003, a
31-store, value-oriented, branded apparel retailer based in the
Northeast United States that offers casual, family apparel.
Bob’s Stores’ target customer demographic includes a
large percentage of male shoppers and spans the moderate to
upper-middle income bracket.

Our off-price mission is to deliver an exciting,
fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brand-name merchandise
at excellent values to our customers. We define value as the
combination of quality, brand, fashion and price. With over 400
buyers worldwide and over 10,000 vendors, we believe we are well
positioned to continue accomplishing this goal. Our key
strengths include:

As an off-price retailer, we offer fine-quality,
name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every
day at substantial savings from comparable department and
specialty store regular prices. We can offer these everyday
savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies,
disciplined inventory management, including rapid inventory
turns, and low expense structure.

In our off-price concepts, we purchase much of
our inventory opportunistically with only a small percentage
specifically manufactured for us. Different from traditional
retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they will
appear on the selling floor, TJX buyers are in the marketplace
virtually every week. By maintaining a liquid inventory
position, our buyers can buy close to need, enabling them to buy
into current market trends and take advantage of the
opportunities in the marketplace. Due to the unpredictable
nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of
supply and demand, we are regularly able to buy the vast
majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with some
merchandise coming from retailers and others. Virtually all of
our buys are made at significant discounts from initial
wholesale prices. We generally purchase merchandise to sell in
the current selling season as well as a limited quantity of
packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and
sell in a future selling season. We are willing to purchase less
than a full assortment of styles and sizes. We pay promptly and
do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional
and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop
shipments to stores or delayed deliveries. Our financial
strength, strong reputation and ability to sell large quantities
of merchandise through a geographically diverse network of
stores gives us excellent access to leading branded merchandise.
Our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our
customers a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday
prices which are below department and specialty store regular
prices.

We are extremely disciplined in our inventory
management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our off-price
chains. We rely heavily on sophisticated, internally developed
inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually
continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive
distribution infrastructure that



supports our close-to-need buying by delivering
goods to the selling floor quickly and efficiently. For example,
highly automated storage and distribution systems track,
allocate and deliver an average of 12,000 items per week to each
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store. In addition, specialized computer
inventory planning, purchasing and monitoring systems, coupled
with warehouse storage, processing, handling and shipping
systems, permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment
of store inventory. Pricing, markdown decisions and store
inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally,
using satellite-transmitted information provided by
point-of-sale computer terminals and are designed to move
inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner.
These inventory management and distribution systems allow us to
achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of
product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted
selling periods.

We operate with a low cost structure relative to
many other retailers. While we seek to provide a pleasant, easy
shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience, we
do not spend large sums on store fixtures. Our selling floor
space is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we
can easily expand and contract departments in response to
customer demand and available merchandise. Also, our large
presence and expertise in the real estate market allows us to
retain very favorable lease terms. In our off-price concepts,
our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared
to traditional department and specialty stores, with our
advertising focused on awareness of shopping at our stores
rather than promoting particular merchandise. Our high sales per
square foot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also
provide expense efficiencies.

With all our off-price chains operating with the
same off-price strategies and systems, we are able to capitalize
upon expertise and best practices throughout our divisions,
develop associates by transferring them from one chain to
another and grow our various businesses efficiently and
effectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 31,
2004 we derived 83.1% of our sales from the United States (29.7%
from the Northeast, 15.2% from the Midwest, 24.5% from the
South, 0.8% from the Central Plains, 12.9% from the West), 8.1%
from Canada, 7.5% from Europe (specifically in the United
Kingdom and Ireland) and 1.3% from Puerto Rico.

Unless otherwise indicated, all store information
is as of January 31, 2004. All references to store square
footage are to gross square feet. Fiscal 2003 means the fiscal
year ended January 25, 2003, fiscal 2004 means the fiscal
year ended January 31, 2004 and fiscal 2005 means the
fiscal year ending January 29, 2005. Our business is
subject to seasonal influences, which causes us generally to
realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of
the year. This is common in the apparel retail business.

T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS

T.J. Maxx is the largest off-price retail chain
in the United States, with 745 stores in 47 states. Marshalls is
the second-largest off-price retailer in the United States, with
659 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in Puerto Rico. We
maintain the separate identities of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
stores through product assortment and merchandising, marketing
and store appearance. This encourages our customers to shop at
both chains.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls primarily target female
customers who have families with middle to upper-middle incomes
and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty
store shopper. These chains operate with a common buying and
merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative
functions, including finance and human resources. The combined
organization, known internally as The Marmaxx Group, offers us
increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices
and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure. These
advantages are key to our ability to sell quality, brand name
merchandise at substantial discounts from department and
specialty store regular prices.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls sell quality brand name
merchandise at prices generally 20%-60% below department and
specialty store regular prices. Both chains offer family
apparel, accessories, giftware and home fashions. T.J. Maxx also
offers women’s shoes and fine jewelry, while Marshalls also
offers a full-line footwear department and a larger men’s
department. In fiscal 2004, T.J. Maxx tested expanded jewelry
and accessories



departments and Marshalls experimented with an
expanded footwear offering. We believe these expanded offerings
will further differentiate the shopping experience at T.J. Maxx
and Marshalls, giving our customers even more reasons to shop at
both concepts. Our plan for fiscal 2005 calls for the addition
of approximately 282 expanded jewelry and accessories
departments at T.J. Maxx and 67 expanded shoe departments at
Marshalls.

In fiscal 2005, we plan to launch a T.J. Maxx
e-commerce website. This website will offer a rapidly changing,
wide selection of quality, brand name fashions priced below
department and specialty store regular prices, designed to
create a shopping experience similar to shopping in our stores.
We see this website as a means to further service our existing
customer base and attract new customers to both the website and
to our stores.

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are generally
located in suburban community shopping centers. T.J. Maxx stores
average approximately 30,000 square feet. Marshalls stores
average approximately 31,000 square feet. We currently expect to
add a net of 60 stores in fiscal 2005. Ultimately, we believe
that T.J. Maxx and Marshalls together can operate approximately
1,800 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico.

HOMEGOODS

HomeGoods is our off-price retail chain that
focuses exclusively on the home fashions market. HomeGoods
offers a broad array of giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs,
accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home. In fiscal
2004, HomeGoods increased its lighting and accent furniture
selections. Many of the HomeGoods stores are stand-alone stores;
however, we also combine HomeGoods stores with a T.J. Maxx or
Marshalls store in a superstore format that we call T.J. Maxx
’N More or Marshalls Mega-Store. We count the superstores
as both a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls store and a HomeGoods store.

HomeGoods, like T.J. Maxx, also plans to launch
an e-commerce website in fiscal 2005, with a similar off-price
approach. The HomeGoods website will offer home fashions in a
wide array of rapidly changing assortments priced below
department and specialty store regular prices. We believe an
e-commerce business is well suited for HomeGoods and will
attract new customers to the website and to our stores.

Stand-alone HomeGoods stores average
approximately 28,000 square feet. In superstores, which average
approximately 52,000 square feet, we dedicate an average of
21,000 square feet to HomeGoods. The 182 stores open at year-end
include 106 stand-alone stores and 76 superstores. In fiscal
2005, we anticipate adding a net of 40 HomeGoods stores,
including 22 superstores. We believe that the U.S. market could
support approximately 500 freestanding HomeGoods stores and 150
superstores in the long-term.

WINNERS AND HOMESENSE

Winners is the leading off-price retailer in
Canada, offering off-price brand name women’s apparel and
shoes, lingerie, accessories, home fashions, giftware, fine
jewelry, menswear and children’s clothing. In fiscal 2002,
Winners opened its first seven HomeSense stores in Canada. Like
our HomeGoods chain, HomeSense offers a wide and rapidly
changing assortment of off-price home fashions including
giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, accessories and
seasonal merchandise for the home. In fiscal 2004, Winners also
opened its first superstore, which combines a Winners store with
a HomeSense store. We count the superstores as both a Winners
store and a HomeSense store.

We currently operate a total of 160 Winners
stores, which average approximately 28,000 square feet and 25
HomeSense stores, which average approximately 24,000 square
feet. We expect to add 8 Winners stores and 15 HomeSense stores
in fiscal 2005, including seven superstores. Ultimately, we
believe the Canadian market can support approximately 200
Winners stores and approximately 80 HomeSense stores.



T.K. MAXX

T.K. Maxx is the only major off-price retailer in
any European country. T.K. Maxx utilizes the same off-price
strategies employed by T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Winners and
offers the same type of merchandise. We currently operate 147
T.K. Maxx stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. T.K. Maxx
stores average approximately 27,000 square feet. T.K. Maxx has
been successfully expanding its selling square footage with the
addition of mezzanines in some of its stores. This increases
sales productivity with little additional rental costs. T.K.
Maxx expects to continue to add mezzanines to its stores where
possible. T.K. Maxx opened 23 stores in the United Kingdom and
one store in Ireland in fiscal 2004. We currently expect to add
a total of 25 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland in fiscal
2005. We believe that the U.K. and Ireland can support
approximately 300 stores in the long term.

A.J. WRIGHT

A.J. Wright, a relatively young chain launched in
fiscal 1999, brings our off-price concept to a different
demographic customer, the moderate income shopper. A.J. Wright
stores offer brand-name family apparel, accessories, footwear,
home fashions, giftware and special, market-driven purchases.
A.J. Wright has advanced its understanding of its target
customers’ tastes and has transitioned to offering both
“hot” fashion items as well as basic apparel
assortments. A.J. Wright stores average approximately 26,000
square feet. We added a net of 24 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal
2004 and operated 99 stores at fiscal year end. We currently
expect to open 32 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2005. We believe
this developing business offers us the long-term opportunity to
open over 1,000 A.J. Wright stores throughout the United States.

BOB’S STORES

Bob’s Stores was acquired by TJX on
December 24, 2003. With large, high-volume stores, branded
apparel selections, a value orientation and a loyal customer
base, Bob’s Stores shares many characteristics with our
off-price chains. Bob’s Stores offers casual, family
apparel and footwear with emphasis on men’s clothing,
footwear, workwear, activewear and licensed team apparel.
Bob’s Stores customer demographics span the moderate to
upper-middle income bracket with a large percentage of male
shoppers. TJX purchased Bob’s Stores as a long-term growth
vehicle and plans to grow Bob’s Stores slowly in the
short-term. We currently operate 31 Bob’s Stores in the
Northeast United States and expect to open 2 additional
Bob’s Stores in fiscal 2005. We see the potential over time
of growing Bob’s Stores to a chain of 400 stores in the
United States.



We operated stores in the following locations as
of January 31, 2004:

*

The HomeGoods store locations include the
    HomeGoods portion of a T.J. Maxx ’N More or a Marshalls
    Mega-Store.

Winners operated 160 stores in Canada: 21 in
Alberta, 5 in Manitoba, 73 in Ontario, 26 in Quebec, 4 in Nova
Scotia, 6 in Saskatchewan, 19 in British Columbia, 3 in New
Brunswick, 2 in Newfoundland and 1 on Prince Edward Island.

HomeSense operated 25 stores in Canada: 23 in
Ontario and 2 in British Columbia. The HomeSense store locations
include the HomeSense portion of a superstore.

T.K. Maxx operated 143 stores in the United
Kingdom and 4 stores in the Republic of Ireland.



EMPLOYEES

At January 31, 2004, we had approximately
105,000 employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per
week. In addition, we hire temporary employees during the peak
back-to-school and holiday seasons.

COMPETITION

The retail apparel and home fashion business is
highly competitive. Our customers focus upon fashion, quality,
price, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
recognition and, to a lesser degree, store location. We compete
with local, regional and national department, specialty and
off-price stores. We also compete to some degree with any
retailer that sells apparel or home fashions in stores, through
catalogues or over the internet. We purchase most of our
inventory opportunistically and compete for that merchandise
with other national and regional off-price apparel and outlet
stores. We also compete with other retailers for store locations.

CREDIT

Our stores operate primarily on a cash-and-carry
basis. Each chain accepts credit sales through programs offered
by banks and others. While we do not operate our own customer
credit card program or maintain customer credit receivables, a
TJX Visa card is offered through a major bank for our domestic
off-price divisions. The rewards program associated with this
card is partially funded by TJX.

BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION

We operate a centralized buying organization that
services both the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains while each of
our other chains has its own centralized buying organization.
All of our chains are serviced through their own distribution
networks.

TRADEMARKS

Our principal trademarks and service marks, which
are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K.
Maxx, A.J. Wright and Bob’s Stores, are registered in
relevant countries. Our rights in these trademarks and service
marks endure for as long as they are used.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion contains forward-looking
information and should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ
materially from the results contemplated by these
forward-looking statements due to various factors, including
those discussed in Item 1 of this report under the section
entitled “Safe Harbor Statements under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.”

Results of Operations

Overview:

During the fiscal year ended January 31,
2004 (fiscal 2004) the Company’s diluted earnings per share
increased 19% to $1.28, which was in the upper end of our
planned range. Our strong results helped us to achieve an
after-tax return on average shareholders’ equity of 44%. We
achieved this performance, despite below plan growth in both
same store and total sales, by growing our pre-tax profit margin
(the ratio of pre-tax income to sales). The pre-tax profit
margin increase was achieved primarily through improvement to
our merchandise margins, the result of effective inventory
management and merchandising strategies. Pre-tax profit margin
also benefited from disciplined expense management and was
favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 calendar.
We continued to grow our business, opening 188 new stores (net
of closings) and, excluding the acquisition of Bob’s
Stores, increasing our store count 10% to 2,031. Bob’s
Stores, a value-oriented chain of 31 stores located in the
Northeast United States, was acquired in December 2003, as a
platform for future growth. Strong cash flows from operations
allowed us to fund our capital expenditure requirements and the
Bob’s Stores acquisition, while continuing our stock
buyback program. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased
27 million shares at a cost of $515 million, which
contributed to earnings per share growth. Our ability to
continue to report annual earnings per share growth will be
driven by revenue growth from our new store openings along with
increases in same store sales, maintaining steady profit
margins, and the benefit from our share repurchase program. The
execution of our buying strategies and disciplined inventory
management, leading to rapid inventory turns, are key factors to
our continued success.

The following is a summary of the operating
results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is
followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All
references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share
unless otherwise indicated. All earnings per share calculations
and per share data have been adjusted to give effect for the
two-for-one stock split distributed on May 8, 2002.

Net sales:

Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended
January 31, 2004, totaled $13.3 billion, an 11.2%
increase over sales of $12.0 billion for our fiscal year
ended January 25, 2003 (fiscal 2003). The net sales for
fiscal 2003 represented an 11.9% increase over sales of
$10.7 billion for our fiscal year ended January 26,
2002 (fiscal 2002). Our reporting period for fiscal 2004
included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal
2003 and 2002. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 increased net sales
by an estimated 1.5% over fiscal 2003.

The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004
includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store
sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week.
Each of these factors includes the favorable effect of changes
in the currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx
operations. Same store sales in fiscal 2004 benefited
approximately 1  1/2 percentage points from foreign
currency exchange rates. The 11% growth in net sales for the
year was less than we had planned, primarily due to lower than
expected same store sales. The increase in net sales of 12% in
fiscal 2003 includes approximately 9% from new stores and 3%
from same store sales growth. Foreign currency exchange rate
changes also favorably impacted fiscal 2003 sales growth but to
a much lesser extent than the impact in fiscal 2004.

New stores are our major source of sales growth.
Our consolidated store count, excluding Bob’s Stores,
increased by 10.2% in fiscal 2004 and 10.7% in fiscal 2003 over
the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage,
excluding Bob’s Stores, increased by 9.6% in fiscal 2004
and by 10.1% in fiscal 2003, in each case over the prior year.
Our acquisition of Bob’s Stores on December 24, 2003,
added 31 units as of the end of



fiscal 2004. Net sales for Bob’s Stores are
included in our results from the date of acquisition, although
the impact on sales growth was not significant.

Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in
fiscal 2004 (including foreign currency benefit) was less than
planned, largely due to the effect of unseasonable weather in
the first half of the year. The sales results for fiscal 2003
reflected strong demand for home fashions and were achieved
despite a weak economy, geopolitical concerns and a highly
promotional retail environment. Same store sales growth in both
years was favorably affected by our younger divisions as their
share of consolidated results continues to increase.

We expect to add 182 stores (net of store
closings) in fiscal 2005, an 8.8% increase in our consolidated
store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage
base by 8.9%. We have planned a 4% to 5% increase in same store
sales and a 13% increase in total sales for fiscal 2005. We
estimate that approximately 1% to 1.5% of this sales growth will
come from favorable currency exchange rates. We plan on adding
or expanding certain departments in many of our stores to help
drive our same store sales growth. These initiatives are
discussed in more detail below.

We define same store sales to be sales of those
stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two
consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are
starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a
store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We
determine which stores are included in the same store sales
calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the
classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a
store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by
comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are
most closely aligned. Relocated stores and expanded stores are
generally classified in the same way as the original store. We
believe that the impact of relocated or expanded stores on the
same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional
same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show
divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign
divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in
currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate
measure of their operating performance.

The following table sets forth our consolidated
operating results as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales, including buying and
    occupancy costs:

Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy
costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.6% in fiscal 2004,
75.8% in fiscal 2003 and 75.9% in fiscal 2002. This ratio in
fiscal 2004 was better than our plan and reflects a significant
improvement in merchandise margin, primarily in the second half
of fiscal 2004. The improved merchandise margin contributed to
an approximate .6% reduction in our consolidated cost of sales
ratio. Successful execution of our inventory and merchandising
strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement.
The improvement in this ratio in fiscal 2004 was partially
offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales
due to lower-than-planned same store sales growth and higher
distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx
distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy
costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal
2004 over last year and distribution costs as a percentage of
net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was
favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting
period as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever
certain fixed costs. The benefit from the



53rd week in fiscal 2004, which we estimate to be
a .2% improvement in this ratio, is reflected in the results
discussed above.

The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in
fiscal 2003 is largely due to the improvement in merchandise
margin at Winners, HomeGoods and T.K. Maxx due to reduced
markdowns resulting from improved inventory liquidity. These
improvements in fiscal 2003 offset an increase in this ratio of
approximately .3% at Marmaxx. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx
experienced higher distribution costs, store occupancy costs and
insurance and employee benefit costs as a percentage of net
sales. Marmaxx was also impacted in fiscal 2003 by a
less-than-planned sales performance.

We anticipate the cost of sales ratio in fiscal
2005 will be similar to fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative
    expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 16.2% in fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 and 15.7% in fiscal 2002. Overall, selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat
compared to fiscal 2003 and in line with our plan. Store payroll
costs as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 2004 as a
result of the levering impact of less-than-planned sales, but
this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of
higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a $16 million litigation
charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated cost of
settling claims related to four California lawsuits that alleged
TJX had improperly classified store managers and assistant store
managers as exempt from California overtime laws. The lawsuits
were settled and paid in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than
$16 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2003 increased by
approximately .3% due to increased costs for medical and
retirement benefits and increases in store payroll attributable
to lower employee turnover. The charge for the California
lawsuits in fiscal 2003 increased selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by .1%. We
anticipate this expense ratio to increase in fiscal 2005 by .3%
to .4% compared to fiscal 2004. This anticipated increase is
largely due to the impact of the planned expansion of certain
departments at many of our stores as well as increased costs for
medical and retirement benefits.

Interest expense, net:

Interest expense, net of interest income, was
$27.3 million in fiscal 2004, $25.4 million in fiscal 2003
and $25.6 million in fiscal 2002. Interest income was
$6.5 million in fiscal 2004 versus $10.5 million in fiscal
2003 and $15.0 million in fiscal 2002. The reduction in
interest income in fiscal 2004 was due to lower cash balances
and lower interest rates. The reduction in interest income in
fiscal 2003 was due to lower interest rates. The decrease in
gross interest expense in fiscal 2003 is due to the inclusion in
fiscal 2002’s interest expense of amortization of debt
expenses relating to the zero coupon convertible notes issued in
February 2001 (see Note C to the consolidated financial
statements). We expect net interest expense to increase slightly
in fiscal 2005.

Income taxes:

Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.4% in
fiscal 2004, 38.3% in fiscal 2003 and 38.2% in fiscal 2002. The
effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 reflects increases in
state income taxes compared to fiscal 2003. The effective income
tax rate for fiscal 2003 includes the favorable effect of the
tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in
exchange for the termination of split-dollar arrangements as
described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements.
This improvement in the effective tax rate was completely offset
by the effect of increases in state income tax rates in fiscal
2003. The slight increase in the effective rate for fiscal 2003
as compared to fiscal 2002 is due to the impact of a one-time
benefit in foreign taxes in fiscal 2002. Based on our operating
plans for fiscal 2005 and an anticipated increase in state
income taxes, we are planning a tax rate for fiscal 2005 of
38.6%.

Income from continuing operations/net
    income:

Income from continuing operations was
$658.4 million in fiscal 2004, $578.4 million in
fiscal 2003, and $540.4 million in fiscal 2002. Income from
continuing operations per share was $1.28 in fiscal 2004, versus



$1.08 in fiscal 2003 and $.97 in fiscal 2002. Net
income for fiscal 2002 includes an after-tax charge of
$40 million, or $.07 per share, due to discontinued
operations for contingent lease obligations associated with
House2Home, Inc. as described in Note L to the consolidated
financial statements. Net income, after reflecting the above
item, was $658.4 million, or $1.28 per share, in fiscal 2004,
$578.4 million, or $1.08 per share, in fiscal 2003 and
$500.4 million, or $.90 per share, in fiscal 2002. We
estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added $.05 to our
earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency
exchange rates during fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to
our earnings per share. The increase in earnings per share, on a
percentage basis, in all periods increased more than the related
earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase
program. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in
fiscal 2005 with planned spending of $550 million.

Segment information:

The following is a discussion of the operating
results of our business segments. We consider each of our
operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance
of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,”
which we define as pre-tax income before general corporate
expense, goodwill amortization (prior to fiscal 2003) and
interest. “Segment profit or loss,” as defined by TJX,
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be
considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from
operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a
measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our
segments, including a reconciliation of “segment profit or
loss” to “income from continuing operations before
provision for income taxes” can be found in Note O to the
consolidated financial statements.

MARMAXX:

Marmaxx had a 1% same store sales decrease in
fiscal 2004, which was below our plan and also below last
year’s 2% increase. Despite a below-plan sales performance,
Marmaxx segment profit margin was above plan as a result of
sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies
and effective expense control. With an expanded distribution
capacity, Marmaxx was able to make closer-to-need buys in fiscal
2004, leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise
margin, especially in the second half of the year. The Marmaxx
segment profit margin was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2004
by the 53rd week, as the sales volume from this extra week
helped lever certain fixed costs. We estimate this impact to be
..2%. Marmaxx segment profit improvement in fiscal 2004 also
reflects the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the
$16 million litigation charge. This charge also reduced
segment profit margin by .2% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal
2002. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx maintained a liquid inventory
position throughout the year, a key factor in this
division’s maintaining its merchandise margin in fiscal
2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The overall reduction in segment
profit margin for fiscal 2003 reflected increases in insurance
and employee benefits, which accounted for a .3% drop in the
segment profit margin. Lower-than-planned sales and increased
store payroll costs, due in part to lower attrition, also
reduced the segment profit margin in fiscal 2003. New stores for
Marmaxx in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 performed above
expectations.

We added a net of 76 new stores in fiscal 2004
and increased total selling square footage by 6%. We expect to
open a net of 60 new stores in fiscal 2005, increasing the
Marmaxx store base by 4%. We expect to increase our selling
square footage by 5%.



WINNERS AND HOMESENSE:

Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners
and HomeSense increased by 4% in fiscal 2004, slightly less than
planned, on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. New stores
for Winners and HomeSense performed above expectations in both
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Segment profit increased 25% in
fiscal 2004 versus a 44% increase in fiscal 2003, and was
slightly above our plan due to favorable changes in currency
exchange rates. We estimate that approximately two-thirds of the
increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was
due to changes in currency exchange rates. Winners and HomeSense
segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below plan and last
year. The reduction in segment profit margin as compared to
fiscal 2003 reflects increased markdowns at Winners and the
increasing impact of HomeSense on their combined results.
HomeSense is at an earlier stage of development and operates
with higher expense ratios than does Winners. In fiscal 2003,
results were driven by a significant improvement in merchandise
margin as a result of better inventory management as well as
improved merchandise flow and mix throughout the year. HomeSense
net sales were 10% of this group’s total net sales in
fiscal 2004 and 7% of total net sales in fiscal 2003.

We added 14 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense
stores in fiscal 2004, and expanded selling square footage in
Canada by 14%. In fiscal 2004, Winners also opened its first
superstore which combines a Winners store with a HomeSense
store. We expect to open 8 Winners and 15 HomeSense stores in
fiscal 2005, including seven superstores, increasing our total
Canadian store base by 12%, and increasing selling square
footage by 13%.

T.K. MAXX:

T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and
Ireland, recorded sales and segment profit that exceeded plan.
Same store sales increased 6% in local currency in fiscal 2004,
on top of a 5% increase in the



prior year. New stores for fiscal 2004 performed
above our expectations. Segment profit increased 37% in fiscal
2004, and we estimate that approximately one-quarter of the
growth in segment profit during fiscal 2004 resulted from
changes in currency exchange rates. The strong segment
performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxx’s strong
execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. In
fiscal 2003, segment profit increased 232%, as we saw a
significant increase in merchandise margin driven by
improvements in inventory management. The growth in segment
profit for fiscal 2003 was also favorably impacted by changes in
currency exchange rates, which accounted for approximately 10%
of the increase in segment profit.

We added 24 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2004,
and increased selling square footage by 24%. The actual store
openings were six fewer than we originally planned, but our
increased use of mezzanine selling floors added selling square
footage during fiscal 2004 and helped offset the fewer store
openings. With mezzanine space, we increase our selling space
with little additional rental costs, thus increasing store
productivity. We plan to open an additional 25 T.K. Maxx stores
in fiscal 2005, and expand selling square footage by 26%.

HOMEGOODS:

HomeGoods’ same store sales grew 1% in
fiscal 2004, less than planned, compared to a 6% increase in the
prior year. Segment profit increased by 55% in fiscal 2004 to
$49.8 million, and was above our plan, despite
less-than-planned sales performance. The better-than-plan
segment profit reflects HomeGoods’ continued solid
execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies, and a
reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales as the business grows. New stores in both
fiscal years performed above expectations. In fiscal 2003,
segment profit margins were up significantly as we saw
improvements in merchandising, inventory management, store
operations and distribution.

We opened a net of 40 HomeGoods stores in fiscal
2004, a 28% increase, and increased selling square footage by
25%. In fiscal 2005, we plan on adding a net of 40 new HomeGoods
stores and increasing selling square footage by 20%.

A.J. WRIGHT:

A.J. Wright sales were up 52% in fiscal 2004 to
$421.6 million, due to an 8% increase in same store sales
and 24 new stores. In fiscal 2004, although same store sales
were slightly below our plan, total net sales were above plan,
reflecting the strong performance of new stores. A.J. Wright
achieved a segment profit of $1.7 million in fiscal 2004,
which was well ahead of plan and up significantly compared to a
segment loss of $12.6 million in fiscal 2003. The
improvement in A.J. Wright’s segment profit is primarily
the impact of



improved merchandising and strong inventory
management leading to improved merchandise margins. Segment
profit for fiscal 2004 also includes a $1.7 million gain in
connection with an agreement to vacate a store property. In
fiscal 2003, A.J. Wright’s segment loss was impacted, in
part, by the unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter in
areas of the country where A.J. Wright has a large concentration
of stores. A.J. Wright’s aggressive store-opening program
for fiscal 2003 also placed strains on this young division and
resulted in some execution issues, which negatively impacted the
bottom line in fiscal 2003.

We added 24 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal
2004, increasing selling square footage by 31%. In fiscal 2005,
we plan to add 32 new stores and increase selling square footage
by 31%.

BOB’S STORES:

On December 24, 2003 we completed the
acquisition of Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented casual,
family apparel retailer operating 31 stores. The results of
Bob’s Stores are included in our consolidated results from
the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2004, Bob’s Stores
contributed $24.1 million to net sales and generated a
segment loss of $5 million. We currently operate 31
Bob’s Stores and expect to open 2 additional stores in
fiscal 2005. We plan to evaluate and further develop this
concept before initiating significant expansion plans. We do not
anticipate Bob’s Stores having a significant impact on
TJX’s earnings over the next several years.

GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE:

General corporate expense for segment reporting
purposes are those costs not specifically related to the
operations of our business segments. This item includes the
costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and
benefits for senior corporate management; payroll and operating
costs of the non-divisional departments for accounting and
budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax,
risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the
occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the
corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes
the benefit costs of existing retirees and non-operating costs
and unusual gains and losses not attributable to individual
divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of income.

The increase in general corporate expense from
fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of
contributions to The TJX Foundation of $9.8 million in
fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, there were no contributions to The
TJX Foundation. This increase in general corporate expense was
partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and
losses and related hedging activity. Fiscal 2004 includes
approximately $1 million in income due to net foreign
exchange gains and losses as compared to approximately
$5 million in net charges in fiscal 2003. The majority of
this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an
economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional
inventory commitments and intercompany activity. We have not
elected hedge accounting for these contracts; thus, the changes
in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in
earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2004, the unrealized fair
value of derivative contracts outstanding has been allocated to
the related segments.

The increase in general corporate expense from
fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 reflects increased costs for
retirement and medical benefits of approximately
$3 million, as well as a pre-tax charge of approximately
$2 million in connection with the transaction terminating
split-dollar life insurance policies for two senior executives
as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements.
This pre-tax charge was offset by tax benefits of $3.8 million
in the income tax provision. Fiscal 2003 also includes
approximately $5 million in net charges due to foreign
exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity as
compared to a net gain of less than $1 million in fiscal
2002.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating activities:

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$770.5 million in fiscal 2004, $908.6 million in
fiscal 2003, and $912.4 million in fiscal 2002. The cash
generated from operating activities each fiscal period is
largely due to strong operating earnings. The decline in net
cash provided from operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 is primarily a result of an increase in our
inventory (net of related increase in accounts payable) at the
end of fiscal 2004 compared to the end of fiscal 2003.
Inventories per store at January 31, 2004 were up 11%
compared to the prior year, and inventories per store at
January 25, 2003 were down 3% compared to the prior year.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates,
inventories per store at January 31, 2004 increased 9% over
the prior year. This increase in inventory was attributable in
part to our plan to raise the level of store inventories over
fiscal 2003 levels. The timing of inventory receipts, in part
due to the 53rd week, also contributed to the higher inventory
levels at January 31, 2004. The cash flows from operating
activities for fiscal 2004 were also impacted by a lower
increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal
2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The lower increase in accrued
expenses and other liabilities reflects reduced accruals for
property additions at the end of fiscal 2004 and the payment of
the California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The significant cash
generated from operating activities in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2002 is largely due to strong operating earnings along with our
liquid inventory position and our buying closer to need. Cash
flows for fiscal 2003 also reflect the favorable impact of an
increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase
in accrued expenses for fiscal 2003 reflects the reserve for the
settlement of the California lawsuits, and higher accruals for
property additions, payroll and benefits, merchandise credits
and occupancy costs.

Operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 were favorably impacted by additional deferred tax benefits
related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve
and due to increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets
allowed for U.S. income tax purposes. The cash flows from
operating activities have been reduced by contributions to our
qualified pension fund of $17.5 million in fiscal 2004,
$58.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $46.8 million in
fiscal 2002. All of the contributions to the pension fund in
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and $26.0 million of the
contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2002, were made on a
voluntary basis. Cash flows from operating activities were also
reduced by $37.2 million in fiscal 2004, $32.2 million
in fiscal 2003, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2002, for cash
expenditures charged against the discontinued operations reserve
as discussed in more detail below.

Discontinued operations
reserve:

We have a reserve for
potential future obligations of discontinued operations that
relates primarily to real estate leases of the former House2Home
and Zayre Stores, for which TJX is an original lessee or
guarantor. These discontinued operations are being liquidated in
bankruptcy by third parties. The reserve activity in prior years
also reflects leases of Hit or Miss, another discontinued
operation that liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party.
The reserve was established at various times subsequent to
TJX’s disposition of these businesses, when the companies
then owning them suffered significant financial distress.

When discontinued operations were sold to third
parties, TJX generally remained secondarily liable with respect
to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform, unless
there are circumstances that terminate or reduce TJX’s
potential liability. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation
of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made
against TJX based on potential secondary liability after
mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations.
Mitigating factors include assignments to third parties, lease
terminations, expirations, subleases, buyouts, modifications and
other actions, legal defenses and use by TJX for its store
opening program.

At January 31, 2004, substantially all of
the House2Home, Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss leases that were
rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted
liability against TJX had been resolved as a result of
negotiated buyouts, assignments to third parties, leasing for
TJX’s own use or for sublease and lease expirations. It is
possible that there will be future costs for leases from these
discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired, but
TJX does not expect any such costs to be material.



The balance in the reserve and the activity for
the last three fiscal years is presented below. The addition to
the reserve in fiscal 2002 relates to House2Home. The charges
against the reserve during fiscal 2004 relate primarily to
House2Home and Zayre Stores lease obligations; during fiscal
2003, the charges relate primarily to House2Home lease
obligations; and during fiscal 2002, the charges relate
primarily to former Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss locations.

We do not expect to incur any material costs
related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve.
In addition, we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the
House2Home bankruptcy, although the amount has not yet been
determined.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 20
leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club for which BJ’s Wholesale
Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued
operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe
that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect
to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition
of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

Off-balance sheet
liabilities:

We have contingent
obligations on any property we have leased or guaranteed and
assigned to third parties without being released by the
landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases
that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number
of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
discontinued operations discussed in Note L to the consolidated
financial statements, we have rarely had a claim with respect to
assigned or guaranteed leases, and accordingly, we do not expect
that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do
not generally have sufficient information about these leases to
estimate our potential contingent obligations under them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection
with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to
estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not
reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of
continuing operations discussed in Note K to the consolidated
financial statements, BJ’s Wholesale Club leases discussed
in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, and
properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet,
if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is
approximately $140 million as of January 31, 2004. We
believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will
not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved
for substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which
we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to
breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to
assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income
taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and
amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets
with respect to these contingent obligations.



Investing activities:

Our cash flows for investing activities include
capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the
table below:

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 were less
than planned primarily due to lower-than-planned spending on
office facilities and information systems. We expect that
capital expenditures will approximate $500 million for
fiscal 2005. This includes $188 million for new stores,
$221 million for store renovations and improvements and
$91 million for our office and distribution centers. Our
planned rate of new store growth per year is in the 8% to 9%
range on a consolidated basis for the next several years. Our
rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of
existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in
planned capital expenditures.

Investing activities for fiscal 2004 include a
net cash outflow of $57.1 million to acquire Bob’s Stores
as discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements.
Investing activities for fiscal 2002 include $5.5 million
of cash outlays due to advances we made under a construction
loan agreement, in connection with the expansion of our leased
home office facility. We received repayments under this loan
agreement of $606,000 in fiscal 2004, $564,000 in fiscal 2003
and $125,000 in fiscal 2002

.

Financing activities:

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in
net cash outflows of $546.8 million in fiscal 2004,
$509.1 million in fiscal 2003, and $99.7 million in
fiscal 2002. The majority of this activity relates to our share
repurchase program and our long-term borrowings.

We spent $520.7 million in fiscal 2004,
$481.7 million in fiscal 2003, and $424.2 million in
fiscal 2002 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased
26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, 25.9 million
shares in fiscal 2003, and 26.3 million shares in fiscal
2002. All shares repurchased are retired with the exception of
75,000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares
purchased in fiscal 2003 all of which are held in treasury.
During July 2002, we completed a $1 billion stock
repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an
additional $1 billion of common stock over several years.
Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock repurchase
program, as of January 31, 2004, we have repurchased
43.0 million shares at a total cost of $818.6 million. All
of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two-for-one stock
split distributed in May 2002.

On February 13, 2001, we issued
$517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes
due in February 2021 and raised gross proceeds of $347.6
million. The issue price of the notes represented a yield to
maturity of 2% per year. The notes are convertible into
16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale
price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the
credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the
notes are called for redemption, or if certain specified
corporate transactions occur. None of these conditions existed
as of January 31, 2004, January 25, 2003 or
January 26, 2002 and thus the shares are excluded from the
diluted earnings per share calculations. The holders of the
notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes in
February 2007 and February 2013. We may pay the
purchase price in cash, our stock, or a combination of the two.
If the holders exercise this option, we expect to fund the
payment with cash, financing from our short-term credit
facility, new long-term borrowings, or a combination thereof. At
the earlier put date of February 13, 2002 no holders
exercised the purchase option, and more recently on
February 13, 2004, only $3,000 in face value of bonds was
put to TJX which were settled in cash. We used the proceeds for
our accelerated store roll-out program, investment in our
distribution center network, general



corporate purposes and our common stock
repurchase program. Financing activities also included scheduled
principal payments on long-term debt of $15 million in
fiscal 2004, and $73,000 in fiscal 2002.

We declared quarterly dividends on our common
stock which totaled $.14 per share in fiscal 2004, $.12 per
share in fiscal 2003, and $.09 per share in fiscal 2002. Cash
payments for dividends on our common stock totaled
$68.9 million in fiscal 2004, $60.0 million in fiscal
2003, and $48.3 million in fiscal 2002. Financing
activities also include proceeds of $59.2 million in fiscal
2004, $33.9 million in fiscal 2003, and $65.2 million
in fiscal 2002 from the exercise of employee stock options.
These stock option exercises also provided tax benefits of
$13.6 million in fiscal 2004, $11.8 million in fiscal
2003, and $30.6 million in fiscal 2002. These benefits are
included in cash provided by operating activities.

We traditionally have funded our seasonal
merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations,
short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of short-term
commercial paper. During fiscal 2003, we entered into a
$370 million five-year revolving credit facility and in
fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for
$330 million. Effective March 19, 2004, the 364-day
agreement was renewed, with substantially all of the terms and
conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. The
credit facilities do not require any compensating balances,
however TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we
believe that the possibility of non-compliance with these
covenants is remote. The revolving credit facilities are used as
backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 31,
2004, there were no outstanding amounts under our credit
facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings
outstanding was $27 million during fiscal 2004 and
$39 million during fiscal 2002. There were no short-term
borrowings during fiscal 2003. The weighted average interest
rate on our U.S. short-term borrowings was 1.09% in fiscal 2004
and 5.32% in fiscal 2002. As of January 31, 2004, we had
credit lines totaling C$20 million for our Canadian
subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian
credit line was C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004,
C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003 and C$22.6 million in
fiscal 2002. The funding requirements of our Canadian operations
were largely provided by TJX.

We believe that our current credit facilities are
more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Notes C and
G to the consolidated financial statements for further
information regarding our long-term debt, capital stock
transactions and available financing sources.

Contractual obligations:

As of January 31, 2004, we have payments due
(including current installments) under long-term debt
arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase
obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in
thousands):

The above maturity table assumes that all holders
of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their
put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put
options available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put
options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or
converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022.



Our purchase obligations consist of purchase
orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital
expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments
under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and
commitments under a limited number of executive employment
agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and
operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty.

We also have long-term liabilities that do not
have specified maturity dates. Included in long-term liabilities
is $106 million for employee compensation and benefits,
most of which will come due beyond five years and
$78 million for our rental step-up accrual, the cash flow
requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in
the above table. Our long-term liabilities also include our
discontinued operations reserve of $17.5 million. We expect
a large portion of this reserve will be paid in the next five
years as settlements are reached, while a smaller portion will
extend beyond five years for those reserve obligations tied to
the remaining lease term.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have the obligation to evaluate and select
applicable accounting policies for TJX. We consider our most
critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and
judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation,
retirement obligations, accounting for taxes and reserves for
discontinued operations. We believe that we have selected the
most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and
that the results we would have obtained, had alternative
assumptions been selected, would not be materially different
from the results we have reported.

Inventory valuation:

We use the retail method for valuing
inventory on a first-in first-out basis. Under the retail
method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are
determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it
to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in
the retail industry and involves management estimates with
regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A
significant factor involves the recording and timing of
permanent markdowns. Under the first-in first-out retail method,
permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation
when the price of an item is changed. We believe the first-in
first-out retail method results in a more conservative inventory
valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a
normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to
when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for
management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a
shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full
physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference
between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in
quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results.
Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our
disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical
inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory
valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have
arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and
allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the
value of the inventory. Our off-price businesses have
historically not entered into such arrangements with our
vendors. Bob’s Stores, the value-oriented retailer we
acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships
that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain
conditions are met. These arrangements will likely have some
impact on Bob’s Stores’ inventory valuation but such
amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results for fiscal
2004. Over time, we have found that actual results involving
inventory valuation issues have not varied significantly from
our estimates.

Retirement obligations:

Retirement costs are accrued over the
service life of an employee and represent an obligation that
will ultimately be settled far in the future and is therefore
subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions
regarding such variables as the discount rate for valuing
pension obligations and the long-term rate of return assumed to
be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net
periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which
we determine annually based on market interest rates, has
dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on
pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 have
been considerably less than our expected returns. These two
situations have resulted in a considerable increase in the
annual cost of retirement benefits and have had an unfavorable
effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We
have made contributions of $122.3 million, which exceeded
the minimum required, over the last three years to largely
restore the funded status of our plan. In addition,



during fiscal 2003, we reduced the assumption for
the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets to 8% from
9% which increased net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by
approximately $2 million.

Accounting for taxes:

We are continuously under audit by the
United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities
in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use
taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the
various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible
exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we
believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued
for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in
matters for which accruals have been established or be required
to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in
a given financial period might be materially impacted. The
Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the fiscal years
ended January 2000 through January 2003 and we also
have various state and foreign tax examinations in process.

Reserves for discontinued operations:

As discussed in Note L to the
consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the
management’s discussion and analysis, we have reserves
established for leases relating to operations discontinued by
TJX where TJX was the original lessee or a guarantor and which
have been assigned to third parties. These are long-term
obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous
estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with
respect to a particular lease, how a particular obligation may
ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including
indemnification, may exist. We develop these assumptions based
on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes
and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location.
Actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe
that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most
likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the
ultimate cost we will incur.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (Interpretation
No. 46). In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision
to Interpretation No. 46 to make certain technical
corrections and address certain implementation issues that had
arisen. Interpretation No. 46, as revised, provides a new
framework for identifying variable interest entities
(VIE’s)and determining when a company should include the
assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of
activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.
Interpretation No. 46 was effective immediately for
VIE’s created after January 31, 2003. We adopted the
provisions of Interpretation No. 46, as revised, as of
January 31, 2004. The adoption of this Interpretation had
no impact on our overall financial position and results of
operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” This Statement amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under Statement
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” The provisions of this Statement are
effective for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into
after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no
impact on our overall financial position and results of
operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This
Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. The provisions of this Statement
are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no
impact on our overall financial position and results of
operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised
SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised
Statement requires some additional annual disclosures and makes
certain disclosures required for interim reporting. The
additional disclosures required annually are included in Note I
to the consolidated financial statements. Some of the disclosure
requirements of the revised SFAS No. 132 related to
foreign plans, interim periods and certain other matters are not
effective until fiscal 2005.



On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff
Position No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which addresses
the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to
arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 enacted on December 8, 2003.
Specific guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is
pending and we will assess the impact of such guidance when it
is issued.

Market Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense)
and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in
Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge
a significant portion of our net investment, intercompany
transactions and certain merchandise purchase commitments in
these operations with derivative financial instruments. We
utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset
the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts
are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in
currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into
derivatives for speculative trading purposes.

In addition, the assets of our qualified pension
plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities,
are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock
market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts
to minimize and control our exposure to these market
uncertainties.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    about Market Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense)
and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in
Note D to the consolidated financial statements, on
page F-16, we hedge a significant portion of our net
investment and certain merchandise commitments in these
operations with derivative financial instruments. We enter into
derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic
exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts,
designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying
exposures, most of which are recorded directly in
shareholders’ equity. The contracts are executed with banks
we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of
major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity
analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign
currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the
underlying exposures described above. As of January 31,
2004, the analysis indicated that such market movements would
not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our cash equivalents and short-term investments
and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates.
Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the
Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to
manage our cost of borrowing, however, we believe that the use
of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market
conditions.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming
a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to
the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous
year. As of January 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that
such market movements would not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material
information required to be filed in this annual report has been
made known to them in a timely fashion. There have been no
significant changes in internal controls, or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls, that occurred
during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting, nor were there any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
Company’s internal controls. As a result, no corrective
actions were required or undertaken.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

A.     Summary of
Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation:

The consolidated
financial statements of The TJX Companies, Inc.
(“TJX”, the “Company” or “We”)
include the financial statements of all of TJX’s
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All of TJX’s
activities are conducted within TJX or our subsidiaries and are
consolidated in these financial statements. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The notes
pertain to continuing operations except where otherwise noted.

Fiscal Year:

TJX’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in January. The
fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (“fiscal
2004”) included 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended
January 25, 2003 (“fiscal 2003”) and
January 26, 2002 (“fiscal 2002”) each included
52 weeks.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. TJX considers the more
significant accounting policies that involve management
estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory
valuation, retirement obligations, accounting for taxes and
reserves for discontinued operations. Actual amounts could
differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

TJX records revenue at the time of sale and receipt of
merchandise by the customer, net of a reserve for estimated
returns. We estimate returns based upon our historical
experience. We defer recognition of a layaway sale and its
related profit to the accounting period when the customer
receives layaway merchandise.

Consolidated Statements of Income
Classifications:

Cost of sales,
including buying and occupancy costs include the cost of
merchandise sold and gains and losses on inventory related
derivative contracts; store occupancy costs (including real
estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs, and fixed asset
depreciation); the costs of operating our distribution centers;
payroll, benefits and travel costs directly associated with
buying inventory; and systems costs related to the buying and
tracking of inventory.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
include store payroll and benefit costs; communication costs;
credit and check expenses; advertising; administrative and field
management payroll, benefits and travel costs; corporate
administrative costs and depreciation; gains and losses on
non-inventory related foreign currency exchange contracts and
other nonrecurring gains or losses; and all other miscellaneous
income and expense items.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments:

TJX generally considers
highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Our investments are
primarily high-grade commercial paper, institutional money
market funds and time deposits with major banks. The fair value
of cash equivalents approximates carrying value.

Merchandise
Inventories:

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market. TJX uses the retail method for
valuing inventories on the first-in first-out basis. We almost
exclusively utilize a permanent markdown strategy and lower the
cost value of the inventory that is subject to markdown at the
time the retail prices are lowered in our stores.

Common Stock and
Equity:

TJX’s equity transactions
consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock under
our stock repurchase program and the issuance of common stock
under our stock incentive plan. Under the stock repurchase
program we repurchase our common stock on the open market. The
par value of the shares repurchased is charged to common stock
with the excess of the purchase price over par first charged
against any available additional paid-in capital
(“APIC”) and the balance charged to retained earnings.
Due to the high volume of repurchases over the past several
years we have no remaining

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

balance in APIC. Virtually all shares are retired
when purchased. We have an immaterial number of shares held in
treasury which are reflected as a reduction to common stock
outstanding.

Shares issued under our stock incentive plan are
generally issued from authorized but previously unissued shares,
and proceeds received are recorded by increasing common stock
for the par value of the shares with the excess over par added
to APIC. Income tax benefits due to the exercise of stock
options are also added to APIC and included with the proceeds
received from the option exercise. The income tax benefits are
included in cash flows from operating activities in the
statements of cash flows. The par value and excess of the fair
value over par value of restricted stock awards are also added
to common stock and APIC with an offsetting amount recorded in
unearned stock compensation. The amount included in unearned
stock compensation is amortized into earnings over the vesting
period of the related award.

TJX has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and continues to apply the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” in
accounting for compensation expense under our stock option plan.
TJX grants options at fair market value on the date of the
grant, accordingly no compensation expense has been recognized
for the stock options issued during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.
Compensation expense determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, net of related income tax effect,
amounted to $55.2 million, $41.7 million and
$29.5 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Presented below are the unaudited pro forma
income from continuing operations, net income and related
earnings per share showing the effect that stock compensation
expense, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
would have on reported results.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of applying the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 for the pro forma calculations, the fair
value of each option granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of
..6% in fiscal 2004, .5% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, expected
volatility of 43%, 44% and 46% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively; a risk-free interest rate of 3.3% in fiscal 2004,
3.5% in fiscal 2003 and 5.0% in fiscal 2002; and expected
holding period of six years in all fiscal periods. The weighted
average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $8.75, $8.93 and $8.46 per share, respectively.

Interest:

TJX’s
interest expense, net was $27.3 million, $25.4 million
and $25.6 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Interest expense is presented net of interest
income of $6.5 million, $10.5 million and
$15.0 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
We capitalize interest during the active construction period of
major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the
cost of the related assets. We capitalized interest of
$1.0 million, $559,000 and $222,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Debt discount and related issue expenses
are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the related
debt issues or to the first date the holders of the debt may
require TJX to repurchase such debt.

Depreciation and
Amortization:

For financial reporting
purposes, TJX provides for depreciation and amortization of
property by the use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated
over 33 years, leasehold costs and improvements are
generally amortized over the lease term (typically
10 years) or their estimated useful life, whichever is
shorter, and furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated
over three to ten years. Depreciation and amortization expense
for property was $227.3 million for fiscal 2004,
$196.4 million for fiscal 2003, and $183.1 million for
fiscal 2002. Amortization expense for property held under a
capital lease was $2.2 million in both fiscal 2004 and 2003
and $1.5 million in fiscal 2002. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. Significant costs incurred
for internally developed software are capitalized and amortized
over three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of
disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated and any gain or loss is included in net income.
Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets:

TJX periodically reviews the
value of its property and intangible assets in relation to the
current and expected operating results of the related business
segments in order to assess whether there has been a permanent
impairment of their carrying values. An impairment exists when
the undiscounted cash flow of an asset is less than the carrying
cost of that asset. Store by store impairment analysis is
performed, at a minimum on an annual basis, in the fourth
quarter of a fiscal year.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill is primarily the
excess of the purchase price paid over the carrying value of the
minority interest acquired in fiscal 1990 in TJX’s former
83%-owned subsidiary and represents goodwill associated with the
T.J. Maxx chain and is included in the Marmaxx segment at
January 31, 2004. In addition, goodwill includes the excess
of cost over the estimated fair market value of the net assets
of Winners acquired by TJX in fiscal 1991.

Goodwill, net of amortization, totaled
$71.4 million and $71.5 million as of January 31,
2004 and January 25, 2003, respectively, and through
January 26, 2002 was being amortized over 40 years on
a straight-line basis. Annual amortization of goodwill was
$2.6 million in fiscal 2002. There was no amortization of
goodwill in fiscal 2004 or 2003. Cumulative amortization as of
January 31, 2004 and January 25, 2003 was
$32.9 million.

Tradenames include the values assigned to the
name “Marshalls,” acquired by TJX in fiscal 1996 in
the acquisition of the Marshalls chain, and to the name
“Bob’s Stores” acquired by TJX in December 2003
when we acquired substantially all of the assets of Bob’s
Stores as discussed in Note B. These values were determined
by the discounted present value of assumed after-tax royalty
payments, offset by a reduction for their pro-rata share of
negative goodwill.

The Marshalls tradename was assigned a value of
$128.3 million, and through January 26, 2002 was being
amortized over 40 years. In fiscal 2003, upon
implementation of SFAS No. 142, the tradename was
deemed to have an indefinite life and no further amortization
has been recorded. Amortization of $3.2 million was
recognized in fiscal 2002. Cumulative amortization as of
January 31, 2004 and January 25, 2003, was
$20.6 million. The Bob’s Stores tradename was assigned
a value of $4.4 million and is being amortized over
10 years.

The Company occasionally acquires other
trademarks in connection with private label merchandise. Such
trademarks are included in other assets and are amortized to
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs over the
term of the agreement generally from 7 to 10 years.
Amortization expense related to trademarks was $519,000,
$369,000 and $126,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company had $3.0 million and
$3.2 million in trademarks, net of accumulated
amortization, at January 31, 2004 and January 25,
2003, respectively. Trademarks and the related amortization are
included in the related operating segment.

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This Statement
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be
accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the
financial statements. We implemented SFAS No. 142
during our fiscal year beginning January 27, 2002. As a
result of the new standard, we no longer amortize goodwill or
the value of the Marshalls tradename which has an indefinite
life. An impairment analysis is performed for goodwill and
tradenames, at a minimum on an annual basis, in the fourth
quarter of a fiscal year. No impairments have been recorded on
these assets to date.

amortization had not been included as an expense in fiscal 2002:

Advertising Costs:

TJX expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense
was $148.4 million, $135.3 million and
$128.5 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Earnings Per Share:

All earnings per share amounts discussed refer to diluted
earnings per share unless otherwise indicated. All historical
earnings per share amounts reflect the May 2002 two-for-one
stock split.

Foreign Currency
Translation:

TJX’s foreign assets
and liabilities are translated at the fiscal year end exchange
rate. Activity of the foreign operations that affect the
statements of income and cash flows are translated at the
average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. The
translation adjustments associated with the foreign operations
are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustments included in
shareholders’ equity, amounted to a gain of
$21.4 million, net of related tax effects of
$16.3 million, as of January 31, 2004, and amounted to
a gain of $6.2 million as of January 25, 2003.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activity:

TJX enters into financial
instruments to manage our cost of borrowing and to manage our
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The
Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets
or liabilities in the statements of financial position and
measures those instruments at fair value. Changes to the fair
value of derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are reported in earnings in the period of the change.
For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, changes in
the fair value of the derivatives are either recorded in
shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive
income or are recognized currently in earnings, along with an
offsetting adjustment against the basis of the item being
hedged. Cumulative gains and losses on derivatives that have

hedged our foreign operations and that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income amounted to a loss of
$35.0 million, net of related tax effects of
$23.3 million as of January 31, 2004 and amounted to a
loss of $9.4 million as of January 25, 2003.

New Accounting
Standards:

In January 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51”
(Interpretation No. 46). In December 2003, the FASB issued
a revision to Interpretation No. 46 to make certain
technical corrections and address certain implementation issues
that had arisen. Interpretation No. 46, as revised,
provides a new framework for identifying variable interest
entities (VIE’s) and determining when a company should
include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and
results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial
statements. Interpretation No. 46 was effective immediately
for VIE’s created after January 31, 2003. We adopted
the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, as revised, as of
January 31, 2004. The adoption of this Interpretation had
no impact on our overall financial position and results of
operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” This Statement amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under Statement
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” The provisions of this Statement are
effective for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into
after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no
impact on our overall financial position and results of
operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.” This Statement establishes standards for how an
issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The
provisions of this Statement are effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003.
The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall
financial position and results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised SFAS
No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised Statement
requires some additional annual disclosures and makes certain
disclosures required for interim reporting. The additional
disclosures required annually are included in Note I. Some
of the disclosure requirements of the revised SFAS No. 132
related to foreign plans, interim periods and certain other
matters are not effective until fiscal 2005.

On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff
Position No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” which
addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are
expected to arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 enacted on
December 8, 2003. Specific guidance on the accounting for
the federal subsidy is pending and we will assess the impact of
such guidance when it is issued.

We have reclassified certain amounts in prior years’
financial statements for comparative purposes.

B.     Acquisition of
Bob’s Stores

On December 24, 2003, TJX completed the
acquisition of Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented retail chain
in the Northeast United States. Pursuant to the acquisition
agreement, TJX purchased substantially all of the assets of
Bob’s Stores, including one owned location, and
assumed leases for 30 Bob’s Stores locations, its Meriden,
Connecticut office and warehouse lease, along with specified
operating contracts and customer, vendor and employee
obligations. The purchase price, which is net of proceeds
received from a third party, amounted to $57.6 million.

The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
Accordingly, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible
assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired, based on
their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over the
fair value is recorded as goodwill and conversely, the excess
fair value over purchase price, “negative goodwill,”
is allocated as a reduction to the long-lived assets.

The following table presents the allocation of
the $57.6 million purchase price to the assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values,
including an allocation of negative goodwill of
$2.4 million as of December 24, 2003:

The intangible assets include $10.3 million
assigned to favorable leases which is being amortized over the
related lease terms and includes $4.4 million for the value
of the tradename “Bob’s Stores” which is being
amortized over 10 years.

The results of Bob’s Stores have been
included in our consolidated financial statements from the date
of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations assuming the
acquisition of Bob’s Stores occurred as of the beginning of
fiscal 2004 have not been presented, as the inclusion of the
results of operations for the acquired business would not have
produced a material impact on the reported sales, net income or
earnings per share of the Company.

The above maturity table assumes that all holders
of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their
put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put
options available to them in fiscal 2014. Any of the notes on
which put options are not exercised, redeemed or converted will
mature in fiscal 2022.

THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In February 2001, TJX issued $517.5 million
zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021
and raised gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue
price of the notes represents a yield to maturity of 2% per
year. Due to provisions of the first put option on
February 13, 2002, we amortized the debt discount assuming
a 1.5% yield for fiscal 2002. The notes are subordinated to all
existing and future senior indebtedness of TJX. The notes are
convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX
if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified
thresholds, if the credit rating of the notes is below
investment grade, if the notes are called for redemption or if
certain specified corporate transactions occur. The holders of
the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes for
$391.7 million and $441.3 million on February 13,
2007 and 2013, respectively. The repurchase amounts represent
original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount. We
may pay the purchase price in cash, TJX stock or a combination
of the two. If the holders exercise their put options, we expect
to fund the payment with cash, financing from our short-term
credit facility, new long-term borrowings or a combination
thereof. At the put date on February 13, 2004, three of the
notes were put to TJX. In addition, if a change in control of
TJX occurs on or before February 13, 2007, each holder may
require TJX to purchase for cash all or a portion of such
holder’s notes. We may redeem for cash all, or a portion
of, the notes at any time on or after February 13, 2007 for
the original purchase price plus accrued original issue
discount. We used the proceeds of this issuance for our
accelerated store roll-out program, investment in our
distribution center network, our common stock repurchase program
and general corporate purposes.

In December 1999, TJX issued $200 million of
7.45% ten-year notes. The proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes, including our ongoing stock repurchase
program.

The fair value of our general corporate debt,
including current installments, is estimated by obtaining market
value quotes given the trading levels of other bonds of the same
general issuer type and market perceived credit quality. The
fair value of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes is
estimated by obtaining market quotes. The fair value of general
corporate debt, including current installments, at
January 31, 2004 is $345.6 million versus a carrying
value of $301.5 million. The fair value of the zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes is $443.4 million versus a
carrying value of $368.3 million. These estimates do not
necessarily reflect certain provisions or restrictions in the
various debt agreements which might affect our ability to settle
these obligations.

During fiscal 2003, we entered into a
$370 million five-year revolving credit facility and in
fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility for
$330 million. Effective March 19, 2004, the 364-day
agreement was renewed, with substantially all of the terms and
conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. Our
ability to borrow under the agreements is not limited by our
debt rating level. The credit facilities do not require any
compensating balances however, TJX must maintain certain
leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Based on our current
financial condition, we believe that the possibility of
non-compliance with these covenants is remote. The revolving
credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper
program. As of January 31, 2004, all $700 million of
the revolving credit facilities were available for use. Interest
is payable on borrowings at rates equal to or less than prime.
The maximum amount of our U.S. short-term borrowings was
$27 million in fiscal 2004 and $39 million in fiscal
2002. There were no short-term borrowings during fiscal 2003.
The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short-term
borrowings was 1.09% in fiscal 2004 and 5.32% in fiscal 2002.

As of January 31, 2004, TJX had credit lines
totaling C$20 million to meet certain operating needs of
its Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under
our Canadian credit lines was C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004,
C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003 and C$22.6 million in
fiscal 2002.

D.     Financial
Instruments

TJX enters into financial instruments to manage
our cost of borrowing and to manage our exposure to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate
Contracts:

In December 1999, prior to
the issuance of the $200 million ten-year notes, TJX
entered into a rate-lock agreement to hedge the underlying
treasury rate of notes. The cost of this agreement has been
deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the
term of the notes and results in an effective fixed rate of
7.60% on this debt. During fiscal 2004 TJX entered interest rate
swaps on $100 million of the $200 million ten-year
notes effectively converting the interest on that portion of the
unsecured notes from fixed to a floating rate of interest
indexed to the six-month LIBOR rate. The maturity date of the
interest rate swaps coincides with the maturity date of the
underlying debt. Under these swaps, TJX pays a specified
variable interest rate and receives the fixed rate applicable to
the underlying debt. The interest income/expense on the swaps is
accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest
expense accrued on the fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swaps
are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt. The
fair value of the contracts, excluding the net interest accrual,
amounted to a liability of $3.1 million as of
January 31, 2004. The valuation of the swaps results in an
offsetting fair value adjustment to the debt hedged;
accordingly, long-term debt has been reduced by
$3.1 million. As of January 31, 2004, the average
effective interest rate, on the $100 million of the 7.45%
unsecured notes to which the swaps apply, was approximately
5.30%.

Foreign Currency
Contracts:

TJX enters into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts to obtain an economic hedge
on firm U.S. dollar and Euro merchandise purchase
commitments made by its foreign subsidiaries, T. K. Maxx (United
Kingdom) and Winners (Canada). These commitments are typically
six months or less in duration. The contracts outstanding at
January 31, 2004 cover certain commitments for the first
quarter of fiscal 2005. TJX elected not to apply hedge
accounting rules to these contracts. The change in the fair
value of these contracts resulted in income of $1.1 million
in fiscal 2004, expense of $2.6 million in fiscal 2003 and
income of $855,000 in fiscal 2002.

TJX enters into forward foreign currency exchange
contracts to obtain an economic hedge on certain foreign
intercompany payables, primarily license fees, for which we
elected not to apply hedge accounting rules. Such contracts
outstanding at January 31, 2004, cover intercompany
payables for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The change in
fair value of these contracts resulted in expense of
$1 million in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and income
of $167,000 in fiscal 2002.

TJX also enters into foreign currency forward and
swap contracts in both Canadian dollars and British pound
sterling and accounts for them as either a hedge of the net
investment in and between our foreign subsidiaries or a cash
flow hedge of long-term intercompany debt. We apply hedge
accounting to these hedge contracts of our investment in foreign
operations, and changes in fair value of these contracts, as
well as gains and losses upon settlement, are recorded in other
comprehensive income, offsetting changes in the cumulative
foreign translation adjustments of our foreign divisions.
Amounts included in other comprehensive income relating to cash
flow hedges will be reclassified to earnings when the currency
exposure on the underlying intercompany debt impacts earnings.
The change in fair value of the contracts designated as a hedge
of our investment in foreign operations resulted in a loss of
$24.7 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2004, a loss
of $23.2 million in fiscal 2003, and a gain of
$8.2 million in fiscal 2002. The change in the cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustment resulted in a gain of
$14.3 million, net of income taxes, in fiscal 2004, a gain
of $23.0 million in fiscal 2003, and a loss of
$8.2 million in fiscal 2002.

TJX also enters into derivative contracts,
designated as fair value hedges, to hedge short-term
intercompany debt and intercompany interest payable. The changes
in fair value of these contracts are recorded in the statements
of income and are offset by marking the underlying item to fair
value in the same period. Upon settlement, the realized gains
and losses on these contracts are offset by the realized gains
and

F-16


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

losses of the underlying item in the statements
of income. The net impact of hedging activity related to these
intercompany payables resulted in losses of $1.6 million,
$954,000 and $429,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Effective January 31, 2004 the value of
foreign currency exchange contracts relating to inventory
commitments is reported in current earnings as a component of
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. The income
statement impact of all other foreign currency contracts is
reported as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Following is a summary of TJX’s derivative
financial instruments and related fair values, outstanding at
January 31, 2004:

The fair value of the derivatives is classified
as assets or liabilities, current or non-current, based upon
valuation results and settlement dates of the individual
contracts. Following are the balance sheet classifications of
the fair value of our derivatives:

F-17


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

TJX’s forward foreign currency exchange and
swap contracts require us to make payments of certain foreign
currencies for receipt of U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or
Euros. All of these contracts except the contracts relating to
our investment in our foreign operations mature during fiscal
2005. The British pound sterling investment hedges have
maturities from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2009, the Canadian dollar
investment hedges have maturities from fiscal 2005 to fiscal
2010.

The counterparties to the forward exchange
contracts and swap agreements are major international financial
institutions and the contracts contain rights of offset, which
minimize our exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by one of the counterparties. We do not require
counterparties to maintain collateral for these contracts. We
periodically monitor our position and the credit ratings of the
counterparties and do not anticipate losses resulting from the
nonperformance of these institutions.

E.     Commitments

TJX is committed under long-term leases related
to its continuing operations for the rental of real estate and
fixtures and equipment. Most of our leases are store operating
leases with a ten-year initial term and options to extend for
one or more five-year periods. Certain Marshalls leases,
acquired in fiscal 1996, had remaining terms ranging up to
twenty- five years. Leases for T.K. Maxx are generally for
fifteen to twenty-five years with ten-year kick-out options.
Many of the leases contain escalation clauses and early
termination penalties. In addition, we are generally required to
pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses
including, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales.

Following is a schedule of future minimum lease
payments for continuing operations as of January 31, 2004:

The capital lease commitment relates to a
283,000-square-foot addition to TJX’s home office facility.
Rental payments commenced June 1, 2001, and we recognized a
capital lease asset and related obligation equal to the present
value of the lease payments of $32.6 million.

Rental expense under operating leases for
continuing operations amounted to $597.8 million,
$524.7 million and $446.6 million for fiscal 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Rental expense includes contingent
rent and is reported net of sublease income. Contingent rent
paid was $8.6 million, $8.2 million and
$6.8 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively;
and sublease income was $3.0 million, $3.2 million and
$3.7 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The total net present value of TJX’s minimum operating
lease obligations approximates $3,350.8 million as of
January 31, 2004, including a current portion of
$440.2 million.

F.     Stock
Compensation Plans

In the following note, all references to
historical awards, outstanding awards and availability of shares
for future grants under TJX’s Stock Incentive Plan and
related prices per share have been restated, for comparability
purposes, to reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed in
May 2002.

TJX has a stock incentive plan under which
options and other stock awards may be granted to its directors,
officers and key employees. This plan has been approved by
TJX’s shareholders and all stock compensation awards are
made under this plan. The Stock Incentive Plan, as amended with
shareholder approval, provides for the issuance of up to
109.3 million shares with 9.2 million shares available
for future grants as of January 31, 2004. In June 2001,
shareholders approved an amendment to the Stock Incentive Plan
to permit grants to directors and the Board terminated the
former Directors’ Stock Option Plan.

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, TJX has granted
options for the purchase of common stock, generally within ten
years from the grant date at option prices of 100% of market
price on the grant date. Most options outstanding vest over a
three-year period starting one year after the grant, and are
exercisable in their entirety three years after the grant date.
Outstanding options granted to directors become fully
exercisable one year after the date of grant.

A summary of the status of TJX’s stock
options and related Weighted Average Exercise Prices
(“WAEP”) is presented below (shares in thousands):

TJX realizes an income tax benefit from
restricted stock vesting and the exercise of stock options,
which results in a decrease in current income taxes payable and
an increase in additional paid-in capital. Such benefits
amounted to $13.6 million, $11.8 million and
$30.6 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2004 (shares in
thousands):

We modified option grants of our associates lost
in the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Unvested awards were
vested, and the families were allowed to realize the full
economic benefit of the original grants and we provided other
benefits to the families. During fiscal 2002, we recorded
additional compensation expense related to these option
modifications and benefits. We do not typically modify awards
after the date of grant.

TJX has also issued restricted stock and
performance-based stock awards under the Stock Incentive Plan.
Restricted stock awards are issued at no cost to the recipient
of the award, and have restrictions that generally lapse over
three to four years from date of grant. Performance-based shares
have restrictions that generally lapse over one to four years
when and if specified criteria are met. The market value in
excess of cost is charged to income ratably over the period
during which these awards vest. Such pre-tax charges amounted to
$10.2 million, $3.2 million and $2.7 million in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The market value of
the awards is determined at date of grant for restricted stock
awards, and at the date shares are earned for performance-based
awards.

A combined total of 600,000 shares,
325,000 shares and 450,000 shares for restricted and
performance-based awards were issued in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. No shares were forfeited during fiscal 2004,
2003 or 2002. The weighted average market value per share of
these stock awards at grant date was $19.16, $19.85 and $15.00
for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

TJX maintained a separate deferred stock
compensation plan for its outside directors under which deferred
share awards valued at $10,000 each were issued annually to
outside directors. During fiscal 2003, the Board merged this
deferred stock compensation plan into the Stock Incentive Plan,
and all deferred shares earned will be issued pursuant to the
Stock Incentive Plan. Beginning in June 2003, the annual
deferred share award granted to each outside director is valued
at $30,000. As of the end of fiscal 2004, a total of 58,717
deferred shares had been granted under the plan. Actual shares
will be issued at termination of service or a change of control.
Prior to merging the deferred stock award plan into the Stock
Incentive Plan, TJX planned to issue actual shares from shares
held in treasury. Currently we have 250,276 shares held in
treasury.

G.     Capital Stock
and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock:

TJX
distributed a two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend, on May 8, 2002 to shareholders of
record on April 25, 2002, which resulted in the issuance of
269.4 million shares of common stock and a corresponding
decrease of $269.4 million in retained earnings. All
historical earnings per share amounts and reference to common
stock activity in the notes have been restated to reflect the
two-for-one stock split.

During fiscal 2003, we completed a
$1 billion stock repurchase program begun in fiscal 2001
and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock
repurchase program. We had cash expenditures under all of our
repurchase programs of $520.7 million, $481.7 million
and $424.2 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, funded primarily by cash generated from
operations. The total common shares repurchased amounted to
26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, 25.9 million
shares in fiscal 2003 and 26.3 million shares in fiscal
2002. As of January 31, 2004, we had repurchased
43.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$818.6 million under the current $1 billion stock
repurchase program. All shares repurchased have been retired
except 75,000 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal 2004
and 2003, respectively, which are held in treasury.

TJX has authorization to issue up to
5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $1. There
was no preferred stock issued or outstanding at January 31,
2004.

Earnings Per Share:

The following schedule presents the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for income from continuing operations:

The weighted average common shares for the
diluted earnings per share calculation exclude the incremental
effect related to outstanding stock options, the exercise price
of which is in excess of the related fiscal year’s average
price of TJX’s common stock. Such options are excluded
because they would have an antidilutive effect. These options
amounted to 22.7 million as of January 31, 2004,
11.2 million as of January 25, 2003 and
10.6 million as of January 26, 2002. The
16.9 million shares issuable upon conversion of the zero
coupon convertible debt were also excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation because criteria for conversion
had not been met during the fiscal years presented.

Income from continuing operations before
provision for income taxes, attributable to our foreign
operations, amounted to $121.6 million in fiscal 2004,
$89.9 million in fiscal 2003 and $44.5 million in fiscal
2002. TJX has provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all
undistributed Canadian earnings. All earnings of TJX’s
other foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested and no
deferred taxes have been provided for on those earnings.

TJX has a United Kingdom operating loss
carryforward of approximately $30.2 million that may be
applied against future taxable income in the U.K., all of which
has been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The U.K.
net operating loss does not expire under current tax law. In
fiscal 2003 TJX utilized a Puerto Rico net operating loss
carry-forward of approximately $1 million which was
acquired in the Marshalls acquisition. No Puerto Rico net
operating loss carryforward exists as of January 31, 2004.

TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate
was 38.4% for fiscal 2004, 38.3% for fiscal 2003, and 38.2% for
fiscal 2002. The difference between the U.S. federal
statutory income tax rate and TJX’s worldwide effective
income tax rate is reconciled below:

The additional benefit reflected in “all
other” in fiscal 2003 is due to the favorable effect of the
tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in
exchange for the termination of split-dollar arrangements
described in Note I.

Pension Plans and Other Retirement
    Benefits

Pension:

TJX has a
funded defined benefit retirement plan covering the majority of
its full-time U.S. employees. Employees who have attained
twenty-one years of age and have completed one year of service
are covered under the plan. No employee contributions are
required and benefits are based on compensation earned in each
year of service. We also have an unfunded supplemental
retirement plan which covers key employees of the Company and
provides additional retirement benefits based on average
compensation. Our funded defined benefit retirement plan assets
are invested primarily in stock and bonds of
U.S. corporations, excluding TJX, as well as various
investment funds.

Presented below is financial information relating
to TJX’s funded defined benefit retirement plan (Funded
Plan) and its unfunded supplemental pension plan (Unfunded Plan)
for the fiscal years indicated. The valuation date for both
plans is as of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end
date:

F-24


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The net asset attributable to the funded plan is
reflected on the balance sheets as a non-current asset of
$32.3 million and a current asset of $31.5 million as
of January 31, 2004 and a non-current asset of
$49.4 million and a current asset of $26.7 million as
of January 25, 2003. The net accrued liability attributable
to TJX’s unfunded supplemental retirement plan is included
in other long-term liabilities on the balance sheets.

We made aggregate cash contributions of
$19.7 million and $59.9 million for fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively, to the non-contributory defined benefit
retirement plan and to fund current benefit and expense payments
under the unfunded supplemental retirement plan. Our funding
policy is to fund any required contribution to the plan at the
full funding limitation. Contributions in excess of any required
contribution will be made so as to fully fund the accumulated
benefit obligation to the extent such contribution is allowed
for tax purposes. As a result of voluntary funding contributions
made in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we do not anticipate any
funding requirements for fiscal 2005. The following is a summary
of our target allocation for plan assets along with the actual
allocation of plan assets as of the valuation date for the
fiscal years presented:

We employ a total return investment approach
whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments is used
to maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent
level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful
consideration of plan liabilities, funded plan status, and
corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio contains
a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as small and large
capitalizations. Both actively managed and passively invested
portfolios may be utilized for U.S. equity investments.
Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge
funds are currently used or are under consideration for their
diversification and return enhancing characteristics.
Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient
and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to
leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying
investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews,
annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.

We employ a building block approach in
determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and long-term historical
relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved
consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle
that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return
over the long term. Current market factors such as inflation and
interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market
assumptions are determined. Proper consideration is also given
to asset class diversification and rebalancing as well as to the
expected returns likely to be earned over the life of

F-25

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the plan by each category of plan assets. Peer
data and historical returns are reviewed to check for
reasonability and appropriateness.

Following are the components of net periodic
benefit cost for our pension plans:

Net pension expense for fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 reflects an increase in service cost due to a reduction in
the discount rate and an increase in the amortization of
actuarial losses. Net periodic pension cost in all periods also
reflects increased service cost attributable to the change in
assumption regarding mortality effective at the beginning of
fiscal 2002. The increase in cost due to the recognized
actuarial losses is the result of accumulated losses due to a
reduction in the discount rate, lower than expected asset
performance and a change in the mortality assumption.

The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of
10% of the projected benefit obligation are amortized over the
average remaining service life of participants. In addition, for
the unfunded plan, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that
exceed 30% of the projected benefit obligation are fully
recognized in net periodic pension cost.

During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company entered
into separate arrangements with two executives whereby the
Company agreed to fund life insurance policies on a so-called
split-dollar basis in exchange for a waiver of all or a portion
of the executives’ retirement benefits under TJX’s
supplemental retirement plan. The arrangements were designed so
that the after-tax cash expenditures by TJX on the policies, net
of expected refunds of premiums paid, would be substantially
equivalent, on a present value basis, to the after-tax cash
expenditures that TJX would have incurred under its unfunded
supplemental retirement plan. During fiscal 2003, it was decided
to unwind the earlier transactions due to changes in the law.
During fiscal 2003, TJX’s obligations under the
split-dollar arrangements were canceled and TJX agreed to pay
the individuals additional amounts such that the net after-tax
cost to TJX, taking into account the unwind of those

F-26


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

arrangements, would be substantially equivalent
on a present value basis to the after-tax cost of TJX’s
original supplemental retirement plan obligations to the
individuals. In addition, TJX made a supplemental payment to one
of the individuals and agreed to indemnify the other individual
up to a specified limit for possible taxes associated with the
unwind transaction. Due to the differences in the income
statement reporting and income tax treatment of these two
different types of benefits, the income statement for fiscal
2003 includes a pre-tax charge of $2.1 million, offset by
tax benefits of $3.8 million for an increase in net income
of $1.7 million. The cumulative effect on net income
through fiscal 2003 of the initial transactions in fiscal 2001
and 2000, and of the related transactions in fiscal 2003, is
substantially the same as the after-tax cost of the retirement
benefit earned under the supplemental retirement plan. The
Company has a contingent obligation of $1.2 million in
connection with an indemnification clause relating to one
executive’s potential tax liability.

TJX also sponsors an employee savings plan under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for all
eligible U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2003 and
2002, assets under the plan totaled $421.8 million and
$327.8 million respectively, and are invested in a variety
of funds. Employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible pay.
TJX matches employee contributions, up to 5% of eligible pay, at
rates ranging from 25% to 50% based upon the Company’s
performance. TJX contributed $7.3 million in fiscal 2004,
$7.1 million in 2003 and $6.2 million in 2002 to the
401(k) plan. Employees cannot invest their contributions in the
TJX stock fund option in the 401(k) plan, and may elect to
invest up to only 50% of the Company’s contribution in the
TJX stock fund; the TJX stock fund has no other trading
restrictions. The TJX stock fund represents 4.5%, 5.1% and 4.8%
of plan investments at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

During fiscal 1999, TJX established a
nonqualified savings plan for certain U.S. employees. TJX
matches employee contributions at various rates which amounted
to $226,000 in fiscal 2004, $218,000 in fiscal 2003, and
$193,000 in fiscal 2002. TJX transfers employee withholdings and
the related company match to a separate trust designated to fund
the future obligations. The trust assets, which are invested in
a variety of mutual funds, are included in other assets on the
balance sheets.

In addition to the plans described above, we also
maintain retirement/deferred savings plans for all eligible
associates at our foreign subsidiaries. We contributed for these
plans $2.3 million, $1.9 million and $1.1 million
in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Postretirement
Medical:

TJX has an unfunded
postretirement medical plan that provides limited postretirement
medical and life insurance benefits to employees who participate
in our retirement plan and who retire at age 55 or older
with ten or more years of service. The valuation date for the
plan is as of December 31 prior to the fiscal year end
date. Presented below is certain financial information relating
to the unfunded postretirement medical plan for the fiscal years
indicated:

For purposes of measuring TJX’s obligations
under the postretirement medical plan, a gross annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
of 6% was assumed in 2004 and is reduced to 5% in 2005 and
thereafter. However, due to the plans’ $3,000 per
capita annual limit on medical benefits the effect of the
changes in trend is limited. An increase in the assumed health
care cost trend rate of one percentage point for all future
years would increase the postretirement benefit obligation at
January 31, 2004 by approximately $1.5 million and the
total of the service cost and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement cost for fiscal 2004 by approximately
$100,000. Similarly, decreasing the trend

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rate by one percentage point for all future years
would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation at
January 31, 2004 by approximately $1.4 million as well
as the total of the service cost and interest cost components of
net periodic postretirement cost for fiscal 2004 by
approximately $100,000.

Following are components of net periodic benefit
cost related to our Postretirement Medical plan:

As of January 25, 2003, in addition to
TJX’s postretirement plan described above, we had a
retirement prescription drug benefit that was included in
several collective bargaining agreements. The prescription drug
benefit obligation as of January 25, 2003, amounted to
$8.1 million with a periodic benefit cost of
$1.5 million for fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004 the collective
bargaining agreements were amended which eliminated this
obligation.

J.     Accrued
Expenses and Other Liabilities, Current and Long-Term

The major components of accrued expenses and
other current liabilities are as follows:

All other current liabilities include accruals
for income taxes payable, insurance, property additions,
dividends, freight, advertising, and other items, each of which
are individually less than 5% of current liabilities.

The major components of other long-term
liabilities are as follows:

Activity related to the reserves for store
closing and restructuring and discontinued operations are
detailed in Notes K and L respectively.

K. Reserve for Store Closing and
Restructuring

TJX’s store closing and restructuring
reserve relates primarily to a restructuring plan in connection
with our acquisition of Marshalls in November 1995. This
reserve, which was subsequently adjusted, included the cost of
closing 32 T.J. Maxx stores and the cost of closing
70 Marshalls stores and other Marshalls facilities. The
T.J. Maxx closing costs were charged to operations while
the costs associated with Marshalls were a component of the
allocation of the purchase price. This reserve also includes
activity relating to the closing of three T.K. Maxx stores
in the Netherlands, as well as several HomeGoods stores.

Following is a summary of activity in the store
closing and restructuring reserve:

The remaining balance in the store closing and
restructuring reserve as of January 31, 2004 of
$6.6 million is primarily for the estimated cost of the
future lease obligations of the closed stores. The estimates and
assumptions used in developing the remaining reserve
requirements are subject to change, however, we believe the
reserve is adequate for these obligations. The use of the
reserve will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over
the next ten to fifteen years as the related leases reach their
expiration dates or are settled. We believe future spending will
not have a material impact on our future annual cash flows or
financial condition.

F-30


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

L.     Discontinued
Operations Reserve and Related Contingent Liabilities

We have a reserve for potential future
obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to
real estate leases of the former House2Home and Zayre Stores,
for which TJX is an original lessee or guarantor. These
discontinued operations are being liquidated in bankruptcy by
third parties. The reserve activity in prior years also reflects
leases of Hit or Miss, another discontinued operation that
liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party. The reserve was
established at various times subsequent to TJX’s
disposition of these businesses, when the companies then owning
them suffered significant financial distress.

When discontinued operations were sold to third
parties, TJX generally remained secondarily liable with respect
to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform, unless
there are circumstances that terminate or reduce TJX’s
potential liability. The reserve reflects TJX’s estimation
of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made
against TJX based on potential secondary liability after
mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations.
Mitigating factors include assignments to third parties, lease
terminations, expirations, subleases, buyouts, modifications and
other actions, legal defenses and use by TJX for its store
opening program.

At January 31, 2004, substantially all of
the House2Home, Zayres Stores and Hit or Miss leases that were
rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted
liability against TJX had been resolved as a result of
negotiated buyouts, assignments to third parties, leasing for
TJX’s own use or for sublease and lease expirations. It is
possible that there will be future costs for leases from these
discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired, but
TJX does not expect any such costs to be material.

The balance in the reserve and the activity for
the last three fiscal years is presented below. The addition to
the reserve in fiscal 2002 relates to House2Home. The charges
against the reserve during fiscal 2004 relate primarily to
House2Home and Zayre Stores lease obligations; during fiscal
2003, the charges relate primarily to House2Home lease
obligations; and during fiscal 2002, the charges relate
primarily to former Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss locations.

We do not expect to incur any material costs
related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve.
In addition, we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the
House2Home bankruptcy, although the amount has not yet been
determined.

We may also be contingently liable on up to 20
leases of BJ’s Wholesale Club for which BJ’s Wholesale
Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued
operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe
that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect
to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition
of BJ’s Wholesale Club.

M.     Guarantees and
Contingent Obligations

We have contingent obligations on any property we
have leased or guaranteed and assigned to third parties without
being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have
assigned numerous leases that we

F-31


THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

originally leased or guaranteed to a significant
number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our
discontinued operations discussed in Note L, we have rarely
had a claim with respect to assigned or guaranteed leases, and
accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient
information about these leases to estimate our potential
contingent obligations under them.

We also have contingent obligations in connection
with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to
estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not
reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of
continuing operations discussed in Note K, BJ’s
Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note L, and properties
of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the
subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately
$140 million as of January 31, 2004. We believe that
most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to
TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for
substantially less due to mitigating factors.

We are a party to various agreements under which
we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to
breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to
assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income
taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and
amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets
with respect to these contingent obligations.

N.     Supplemental
Cash Flows Information

The cash flows required to satisfy contingent
obligations of the discontinued operations as discussed in
Note L, are classified as a reduction in cash provided by
continuing operations. There are no remaining operating
activities relating to these operations.

TJX’s cash payments for interest and income
taxes and non-cash investing and financing activities are as
follows:

Investing activities include advances we have
made under a $35 million construction loan agreement in
connection with the expansion of our leased home office
facility. Upon completion of the project in May 2001, the
advances were converted into a term loan bearing interest of
7.25% per year, maturing December 31, 2015. The
long-term portion of the loan amounting to $33.2 million
and $33.8 million as of January 31, 2004 and
January 25, 2003, respectively, is included in other assets
on the balance sheets.

O.     Segment

The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains are
managed on a combined basis and are reported as the Marmaxx
segment. The Winners and HomeSense chains are also managed on a
combined basis and operate

F-32

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exclusively in Canada. T.K. Maxx operates in the
United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Winners and T.K.
Maxx accounted for 16% of TJX’s net sales for fiscal 2004,
14% of segment profit and 17% of all consolidated assets. All of
our other store chains operate in the United States with the
exception of 14 stores operated in Puerto Rico by Marshalls
which include 5 HomeGoods locations in a “Marshalls Mega
Store” format. All of our stores, with the exception of
HomeGoods, HomeSense and Bob’s Stores sell apparel for the
entire family with a limited offering of giftware and home
fashions. The HomeGoods and HomeSense stores offer home fashions
and home furnishings. Bob’s Stores is a value-oriented
retailer of branded family apparel.

We evaluate the performance of our segments based
on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as
pre-tax income before general corporate expense, goodwill
amortization (prior to fiscal 2003) and interest. “Segment
profit or loss,” as defined by TJX, may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In
addition, this measure of performance should not be considered
an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating
activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of
liquidity.
