ITEM 1.

Business

On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged
with Molson Inc. (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, Adolph Coors
Company became the parent of the merged company and changed its name to Molson
Coors Brewing Company. Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description
of us includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC or the Company) (formerly
Adolph Coors Company), principally a holding company, and its operating
subsidiaries: Coors Brewing Company (CBC), operating in the United States
(U.S.); Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.);
Molson Canada (Molson), operating in Canada; and our other corporate
entities. Any reference to “Coors” means the Adolph Coors Company prior to the
Merger. Any reference to Molson Inc. means Molson prior to the Merger. Any
reference to “Molson Coors” means MCBC, after the Merger.

Unless
otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in U.S. Dollars
(USD or $).

(a)

General
Development of Business

Molson was founded in
1786, and Coors was founded in 1873. Since each company was founded, they have
been committed to producing the highest-quality beers. Our brands are
designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, styles and price
preferences. Our largest markets are Canada, the United States and the United
Kingdom.

The Merger

The Merger was effected by
the exchange of Coors stock for Molson stock in a transaction that was valued
at approximately $3.6 billion. Although Coors was considered the acquirer
for accounting purposes, the transaction was considered a merger of equals by
the two companies. The transaction is discussed in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Sale of Kaiser

On January 13, 2006,
we sold a 68% equity interest in Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (Kaiser) to
FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (FEMSA). Kaiser is the third largest brewer in
Brazil. Kaiser’s key brands include Kaiser Pilsen®, and Bavaria®. We retained a
15% ownership interest in Kaiser, which was reflected as a cost method
investment for accounting purposes during most of 2006. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, we divested our remaining 15% interest in Kaiser by exercising
a put option, for which we collected $15.7 million, including interest. Our
financial statements contained in this report present Kaiser as a discontinued
operation, as discussed further in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

Joint Ventures and Other Arrangements

To
focus on our core competencies in manufacturing, marketing and selling malt
beverage products, we have entered into joint venture arrangements with third
parties over the past decade to leverage their strengths in areas such as can
and bottle manufacturing, transportation and distribution. These joint ventures
include Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC) (aluminum can manufacturing in
the U.S.), Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC) (glass bottle manufacturing in
the U.S.) and Tradeteam, Ltd. (Tradeteam) (transportation and distribution in
Great Britain within our Europe segment).

(b)

Financial
Information About Segments

Our reporting segments have been realigned as a result
of the Merger. We have three operating segments: Canada, the United States and
Europe. Prior to being segregated and reported as a


discontinued operation
during the fourth quarter of 2005, and subsequent to the Merger in the first
quarter of 2005, Brazil was an operating segment. A separate operating team
manages each segment, and each segment manufactures, markets and sells beer and
other beverage products.

See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
financial information relating to our segments and operations, including
geographic information.

Ô

, Coors Fine Light Beer®, Worthington’s® ales,
Caffrey’s®, Reef®, Screamers® and Stones®. We also sell Grolsch® in the United
Kingdom through a joint venture. Additionally, in order to be able to provide a
full line of beer and other beverages to our on-premise customers, we sell
factored brands in our Europe segment, which are third party brands for which
we provide distribution to retail, typically on a non-exclusive basis.

We sold approximately 19% of our 2006 reported volume
in the Canada segment, 56% in the United States segment, and 25% in the Europe
segment. In 2006, our largest brands accounted for the following percentage of
total consolidated volume: Coors Light accounted for approximately 45% of
reported volume, Carling for approximately 19%, and Keystone Light for
approximately 8%.

Our sales volume from continuing operations totaled
42.1 million barrels in 2006, 40.4 million barrels in 2005 and 32.7
million barrels in 2004, excluding Brazil volume in discontinued operations.
The barrel sales figures for periods prior to our Merger on February 9,
2005 do not include barrel sales of our products sold in Canada or the United
States through the former Molson Coors Canada or Molson U.S.A. joint ventures.
Our reported sales volumes also do not include the CBL factored brands
business.

No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated or segmented sales in 2006,
2005 or 2004.


Canada Segment

Molson is Canada’s largest brewer by volume and North
America’s oldest beer company, with an approximate 41% market share in Canada. Molson’s
largest competitor, however, maintains a market share that is only slightly
less than Molson’s. Molson brews, markets, sells and nationally distributes a
wide variety of beer brands. Molson’s portfolio consists of strength or
leadership in all major product and price segments. Molson has strong market
share and visibility across retail and on-premise channels. Priority focus
and investment is leveraged behind key owned brands (Coors Light, Molson
Canadian, Molson Dry, Molson Export and Rickard’s) and key strategic
distribution partnerships (including Heineken, Corona and Miller). Coors Light
currently has an 11% market share and is the largest-selling light beer
and the second-best selling beer brand overall in Canada. Molson Canadian
currently has an 8% market share and is the third-largest selling beer in
Canada.

Our Canada segment
consists primarily of the production and sale of the Molson brands, Coors
Light, and partner and other brands listed above under “Our Products.”  The Canada segment also includes our
partnership arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario,
Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI), and the Western provinces, Brewers’ Distributor
Ltd. (BDL). BRI is consolidated in our financial statements. See Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Sales and
Distribution

Canada

In Canada, provincial
governments regulate the beer industry, particularly the regulation of the
pricing, mark-up, container management, sale, distribution and
advertising of beer. Distribution and retailing of products in Canada involves
a wide range and varied degree of government control through provincial liquor
boards.

Province of Ontario

In Ontario, beer may only
be purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI, at government-regulated
retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, approved agents
of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario or at any bar, restaurant or tavern
licensed by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to sell liquor for on-premise
consumption. All brewers pay a service fee, based on their sales volume,
through BRI. Molson, together with certain other brewers, participates in the
ownership of BRI in proportion to its provincial market share relative to other
brewers. Ontario brewers may deliver directly to BRI’s outlets or may choose to
use BRI’s distribution centers to access retail in Ontario, the Liquor Control
Board of Ontario system and licensed establishments.

Province of Québec

In Québec, beer is
distributed directly by each brewer or through independent agents. Molson is
the agent for the licensed brands it distributes. The brewer or agent
distributes the products to permit holders for retail sales for on-premise
consumption. Québec retail sales for home consumption are made through grocery
and convenience stores as well as government operated stores.

Province of British Columbia

In British Columbia, the
government’s Liquor Distribution Branch currently controls the regulatory
elements of distribution of all alcohol products in the province. Brewers’
Distributor Ltd. (BDL), which Molson co-owns with a competitor, manages
the distribution of Molson’s products throughout British Columbia. Consumers
can purchase beer at any Liquor Distribution Branch retail outlet, at any
independently owned and licensed wine or beer retail store or at any licensed
establishment for on-premise


consumption.
Liquor-primary licensed establishments for on-premise consumption may
also be licensed for off-premise consumption.

Province of Alberta

In Alberta, the
distribution of beer is managed by independent private warehousing and shipping
companies or by a government sponsored system in the case of U.S.-sourced
products. All sales of liquor in Alberta are made through retail outlets
licensed by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission or licensees, such as
bars, hotels and restaurants. BDL manages the distribution of Molson’s products
in Alberta.

Other Provinces

Molson’s products are
distributed in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan through local liquor
boards. Manitoba and Saskatchewan also have licensed private retailers. BDL
manages the distribution of Molson’s products in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In
the Maritime Provinces (other than Newfoundland), local liquor boards
distribute and retail Molson’s products. Yukon, Northwest Territories and
Nunavat manage distribution and retail through government liquor commissioners.

Manufacturing,
Production and Packaging

Brewing Raw Materials

Molson’s goal is to procure highest quality materials
and services at the lowest prices available. Molson selects global suppliers
for materials and services that best meet this goal. Molson also uses hedging
instruments to protect from volatility in the commodities and foreign exchange
markets.

Molson sources barley malt
from two primary providers, with commitments through 2009. Hops are purchased
from a variety of global suppliers in the U.S., Europe and New Zealand, with
commitments through 2007. Other starch brewing adjuncts are sourced from two
main suppliers, both in North America. We do not foresee any significant risk
of disruption in the supply of these agricultural products. Molson and CBC in
the U.S. have benefited from merger-driven cost synergies related to the
acquisition of certain brewing materials. Water used in the brewing process is
from local sources in the communities where our breweries operate.

Brewing and Packaging Facilities

Molson has six breweries,
strategically located throughout Canada, which brew, bottle, package, market
and distribute all owned and licensed brands sold in and exported from Canada. The
breweries are as follows: Montréal (Québec), Toronto (Ontario), Vancouver
(British Columbia), Edmonton (Alberta), St. John’s (Newfoundland) and Creemore
(Ontario). The Montréal and Toronto breweries account for approximately
three-fourths of the company’s Canada production. The Moncton (New Brunswick) brewery
is under construction with plans to be complete by September 2007.

Packaging Materials

Glass bottles

Molson single sources
glass bottles, and has a committed supply through 2007. Availability of glass
bottles has not been an issue, and Molson does not expect any difficulties in
accessing them. However, the risk of glass bottle supply disruptions has
increased with the reduction of local supply alternatives due to the
consolidation of the glass bottle industry in North America. The distribution
systems in each province generally provide the collection network for
returnable bottles. The standard container for beer brewed in Canada is the 341
ml returnable bottle, which represents approximately 69% of domestic sales in
Canada.


In October 2003,
the Canadian Competition Bureau began a review into the validity of industry
arrangements regarding industry bottle standards. The Bureau has recently
advised that they have discontinued their review. The industry arrangements
remain in place.

Aluminum cans

Molson single sources
aluminum cans and has a committed supply through 2007. Availability of aluminum
cans has not been an issue, and Molson does not expect any difficulties in
accessing them. The distribution systems in each province generally provide the
collection network for aluminum cans. Aluminum cans account for approximately
21% of domestic sales in Canada.

Kegs

Molson sells approximately
10% of its beer volume in stainless steel kegs. A limited number of kegs are
purchased every year, and there is no long-term supply commitment.

Other packaging

Crowns, labels, corrugate
and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. Molson
does not foresee difficulties in accessing these products in the near future.

Seasonality of
Business

Total industry volume in
Canada is sensitive to factors such as weather, changes in demographics and
consumer preferences. Consumption of beer in Canada is also seasonal with
approximately 41% of industry sales volume occurring during the
four months from May through August.

Competitive
Conditions

2006 Canada Beer Industry Overview

Since 2001, the premium beer category in Canada has
gradually lost volume to the super-premium and “value” (below premium)
categories. The growth of the value category slowed in 2005 and 2006, and the
price gap between premium and value brands was relatively stable, although the
number of value brands increased. In 2006, we increased regular selling prices
for our premium brands in select markets, but used targeted feature price
activity to generate growth.

The Canadian brewing industry is a mature market. It
is characterized by aggressive competition for volume and market share from
regional brewers, microbrewers and certain foreign brewers, as well as Molson’s
main domestic competitor. These competitive pressures require significant
annual investment in marketing and selling activities.

There are three major beer segments based on price:
super premium, which includes imports; premium, which includes the majority of
domestic brands and the light sub-segment; and value.

During 2006, estimated
industry sales volume in Canada, including sales of imported beers, increased
by approximately 2% on a year-over-year basis.

Our Competitive Position

The Canada brewing industry is comprised principally
of two major brewers, Molson and Labatt, whose combined market share is
approximately 81% of beer sold in Canada. The Ontario and Québec markets
account for approximately 62% of the total beer market in Canada.

Our malt beverages also
compete with other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus our
competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among
these other categories.


Sales of
wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years,
resulting in a reduction in the beer segment’s lead in the overall alcoholic
beverages market.

United States
Segment

Coors Brewing Company is the third-largest brewer by
volume in the United States, with an approximate 11% market share. CBC
produces, markets, and sells the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States
and its territories and includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal
Corporation (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation (RMBC) joint ventures.
The U.S. segment also includes Coors brand volume, primarily Coors Light, that
is sold outside of the United States and its territories, primarily Mexico and
the Caribbean, as well as sales of Molson brand products in the United States.

Sales and
Distribution

In the United States, beer is generally distributed
through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and
retailers. A national network of approximately 550 independent distributors
purchases our products and distributes them to retail accounts. We estimate
that approximately one-fourth of our product is sold on-premise in bars and
restaurants, and the other three-fourths is sold off-premise in liquor stores,
convenience stores, grocery stores and other retail outlets. We also own three
distributorships which collectively handled approximately 2% of our total U.S.
segment’s volume in 2006. Approximately 44% of our volume passes through one of
our 11 satellite re-distribution centers throughout the United States prior to
being sold to distributors. In Puerto Rico, we market and sell Coors Light
through an independent distributor. Coors Light is the leading beer brand in
Puerto Rico. Sales in Puerto Rico represented less than 5% of our U.S. sales
volume in 2006. We also sell our products in several other Caribbean markets.
Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of FEMSA Cerveza,
is the sole and exclusive importer, marketer, seller and distributor of Coors
Light in Mexico.

Manufacturing,
Production and Packaging in the United States

Brewing Raw Materials

We use the highest-quality
water, barley and hops to brew our products. We malt 100% of our production
requirements, using barley purchased under yearly contracts from a network of
independent farmers located in five regions in the western United States. Hops
and starches are purchased from suppliers primarily in the United States. We
have acquired water rights to provide for long-term strategic growth and to
sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought in Colorado. CBC also
uses hedging instruments to protect from volatility in the commodities and
foreign exchange markets.

Brewing and Packaging Facilities

We
have two production facilities in the United States. We own and operate the
world’s largest single-site brewery located in Golden, Colorado. We also
operate a packaging facility located in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. In
order to supply our markets in the eastern United States more efficiently, we
are adding brewing capability to our Virginia facility, which we expect to have
operational by summer of 2007. The Golden brewery has the capacity to brew and
package more than 15 million barrels annually. The Shenandoah brewery will have
a production capacity of approximately 7 million barrels. The Shenandoah
facility will source its barley malt from the Golden malting facility.

We closed our Memphis brewing and packaging facility
in September 2006 and shifted its production to other MCBC facilities. All
products shipped to Puerto Rico or otherwise exported outside the U.S. are now
packaged at the Shenandoah facility, and upon its full build-out, all Puerto
Rico and export volume will be brewed in Shenandoah.


The U.S. segment imports Molson products and a portion
of another U.S. brand volume from Molson’s Montréal brewery.

CBC faces cost challenges
due to the concentration of its brewing activities at few locations, compared
with our other operating segments and compared with our competitors in the
United States, who operate more breweries in geographically diverse locations
in the U.S. These cost challenges have been exacerbated by increases in diesel
fuel costs in recent years. The Shenandoah brewery in part is an effort to
address these challenges.

Packaging Materials

Aluminum

cans

Approximately 61% of our
U.S. products were packaged in aluminum cans in 2006. We purchased
approximately 80% of those cans from RMMC, our joint venture with Ball
Corporation (Ball), whose production facility is located adjacent to the
brewery in Golden, Colorado. In addition to our supply agreement with RMMC, we
also have a commercial supply agreement with Ball to purchase cans and ends in
excess of what is supplied through RMMC. Aluminum is an exchange-traded
commodity, and its price can be volatile. The RMMC joint venture agreement is
scheduled to expire in 2012.

Glass

bottles

We packaged approximately
28% of our U.S. products in 2006 in glass bottles. RMBC, our joint venture with
Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens), produces approximately
60% of our U.S. glass bottle requirements at our glass manufacturing facility
in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. In July 2003, we extended our joint venture with
Owens for 12 years, as well as a supply agreement with Owens for the glass
bottles we require in excess of joint venture production.

Kegs

The remaining 11% of U.S.
volume we sold in 2006 was packaged in quarter-, half-, and one-sixth barrel
stainless steel kegs. A limited number of kegs are purchased each year, and
there is no long-term supply agreement.

Other packaging

Crowns, labels, corrugate
and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. We
purchase most of our paperboard from a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging
Corporation (GPC), a related party. CBC does not foresee difficulties in
accessing these products in the future.

Seasonality of the
Business

Our U.S. sales volumes are
normally lowest in the first and fourth quarters and highest in the second and
third quarters.

Competitive
Conditions

Known Trends and Competitive Conditions

Industry and competitive
information in this section and elsewhere in this report was compiled from
various industry sources, including beverage analyst reports (

Beer Marketer’s Insights, Impact Databank and The
Beer Institute),

and
distributors. While management believes that these sources are reliable,
we cannot guarantee the accuracy of these numbers and estimates.


2006 U.S. Beer Industry Overview

The beer industry in the United States is highly
competitive and increasingly fragmented, with a profusion of offerings in the
above-premium category. With respect to premium lager-style beer, three major
brewers control approximately 78% of the market. Growing or even maintaining
market share has required increasing investments in marketing and sales. U.S.
beer industry shipments had an annual growth rate during the past 10 years
of 0.8%. Price discounting in the U.S. beer industry was less intense in 2006,
compared with a high level of promotions in the second half of 2005.

Since the change in the
Excise Tax structure in Puerto Rico in June 2002, the beer market there
has been in modest decline.   Additionally, while this market has
traditionally been split among U.S. imports, other foreign imports and local
brewers, due to the tax advantage held by the local brewer, the Medalla brand
has gained significant share in the past several years. Coors Light remains the
market leader in Puerto Rico with an approximate 50% market share.

Our Competitive Position

Our malt beverages compete with numerous above-premium,
premium, low-calorie, popular-priced, non-alcoholic and imported brands.
These competing brands are produced by national, regional, local and
international brewers. We compete most directly with Anheuser-Busch and
SAB Miller (SAB). We also compete with imported craft beer brands. According to

Beer Marketer’s Insights

estimates, we are the nation’s third-largest brewer, selling
approximately 11% of the total 2006 U.S. brewing industry shipments (including
exports and U.S. shipments of imports). This compares to Anheuser-Busch’s
49% share and SAB’s 18% share.

Our malt beverages also
compete with other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus our
competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among
these other categories. Sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales
of beer in recent years, resulting in a reduction in the beer segment’s lead in
the overall alcoholic beverages market.

Europe Segment

Coors Brewers, Ltd (CBL)
is the United Kingdom’s second-largest beer company with unit volume sales of
approximately 10.4 million U.S. barrels in 2006. CBL has an approximate
21% share of the U.K. beer market, Western Europe’s second-largest
market. Sales are primarily in England and Wales, with the Carling brand (a
mainstream lager) representing more than three-fourths of CBL’s total beer
volume. The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL
brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the
production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of
Ireland, factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies, but
sold and delivered to retail by us), and our joint venture arrangement with DHL
(formerly Exel Logistics) for the distribution of products throughout Great
Britain (through Tradeteam). Our Europe segment also manages a small volume of
sales, primarily of Coors products, in Asia and other export markets.

Sales and Distribution

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, beer is generally distributed
through a two-tier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers. Unlike the
United States, where manufacturers are generally not permitted to distribute
beer directly to retail, the large majority of our beer in the United Kingdom
is sold directly to retailers. It is also common in the U.K. for brewers to
distribute beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other
companies to the on-premise channel, where products are consumed in bars and
restaurants. Approximately 30% of CBL’s net sales value in 2006 was these “factored”
brands.


Distribution activities for CBL are conducted by
Tradeteam, which operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation
fleet. Tradeteam also manages the transportation of malt to the CBL breweries.

Over the past three
decades, volumes have shifted from the higher margin on-premise channel, where
products are consumed in pubs and restaurants, to the lower margin off-premise
channel, also referred to as the “take-home” market.

On-Premise Market Channel

The on-premise channel accounted for approximately 62%
of our U.K. sales volumes in 2006. The on-premise channel is generally
segregated further into two more specific categories:  multiple on-premise and free on-premise. Multiple
on-premise refers to those customers that own a number of pubs and restaurants
and free on-premise refers to individual owner-operators of pubs and
restaurants. The on-going market trend from the higher-margin free on-premise
channel to the lower-margin multiple on-premise puts the Europe segment’s
profitability at risk. In 2006, CBL sold approximately 70% and 30% of its
on-premise volume to multiple and free on-premise customers, respectively. In
recent years, pricing in the on-premise channel has intensified as the retail
pub chains have consolidated. As a result, the larger pub chains have been able
to negotiate lower beer prices from brewers, which have not consolidated during
this time.

The installation and maintenance of draught beer
dispensing equipment in the on-premise channel is generally the responsibility
of the brewer in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, CBL owns equipment used to
dispense beer from kegs to consumers. This includes beer lines, cooling
equipment, taps and countermounts.

Similar to other U.K.
brewers, CBL has traditionally used loans to secure supply relationships with
customers in the on-premise market. Loans are normally granted at below-market
rates of interest, with the outlet purchasing beer at lower-than-average
discount levels to compensate. We reclassify a portion of sales revenue as
interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans.

Off-Premise Market Channel

The off-premise channel
accounted for approximately 38% of our U.K. sales volume in 2006. The
off-premise market includes sales to supermarket chains, convenience stores,
liquor store chains, distributors and wholesalers.

Asia

We continue to develop
markets in Asia, which are managed by the Europe segment’s management team. We
have a Japanese business which is currently focused on the Zima and Coors
brands. In China our business is principally focused on the Coors Light brand.
Product sold in Japan and China is contract brewed by a third party in China. The
small amount of remaining Asia volume is exported from the U.S.

Manufacturing,
Production and Packaging

Brewing Raw Materials

We use the highest-quality water, barley and
hops to brew our products. During 2006, CBL produced more than 90% of its
required malt using barley purchased from sources in the United Kingdom. CBL
does not anticipate significant challenges in procuring quality malt for the
foreseeable future. Malt sourced externally is committed through 2008 and is
produced through a toll malting agreement where CBL purchases the required
barley and pays a conversion fee to the malt vendor. Hops and adjunct starches
used in the brewing process are purchased from agricultural sources in the
United Kingdom and on the European continent. CBL does not anticipate
difficulties in accessing these products going forward.


We assure the highest-quality
water by obtaining our water from private water sources that are carefully
chosen for their purity and are regularly tested to ensure their ongoing purity
and to confirm that all the requirements of the U.K. private water regulations
are met. Public supplies are used as back-up to the private supplies in
some breweries, and these are again tasted and tested regularly to ensure their
ongoing purity.

Brewing and Packaging Facilities

We operate three breweries
in the United Kingdom. The Burton-on-Trent brewery, located in the Midlands, is
the largest brewery in the United Kingdom and accounts for approximately
two-thirds of CBL’s production. Smaller breweries are located in Tadcaster and
Alton. Product sold in Ireland and certain Asia markets is produced by
contract brewers.

Packaging Materials

Kegs and casks

We used kegs and casks for
approximately 56% of our U.K. products in 2006, reflecting a high percentage of
product sold on-premise. CBL does not own its own kegs but rather fills and
ships kegs owned by a third party, who manages the supply and maintenance of
kegs and casks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors related to the Europe segment
for further discussion.

Aluminum Cans

Approximately 36% of our
U.K. products were packaged in cans in 2006. All of our cans are purchased
through a supply contract with Ball.

Glass bottles

Approximately 5% of our
U.K. products are packaged in glass bottles purchased through supply contracts
with third-party suppliers.

Other packaging

The remaining 3% of our U.K. sales are shipped in bulk
tanker for other brewers to package.

Crowns, labels, corrugate
and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. CBL
does not foresee difficulties in accessing these or other packaging materials
in the foreseeable future.

Seasonality of
Business

In the U.K., the beer
industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations primarily influenced by
holiday periods, weather and by certain major televised sporting events (such
as the World Cup soccer tournament in the summer of 2006). Peak selling seasons
occur during the summer and during the Christmas and New Year periods. The
Christmas/New Year holiday peak is most pronounced in the off-premise channel.
Consequently, our largest quarters by volume are the third and fourth quarters,
and the smallest are the first and second.

Competitive
Conditions

2006 U.K. Beer Industry Overview

Beer consumption in the United Kingdom declined by an
average of 0.9% per annum between 1980 and 2000. Total trade beer market volume
declined by 1.2% in 2006. This was the third consecutive year of


decline and reverses the
relatively stable trend seen during 2000 to 2003. The longer-term decline has
been mainly attributable to the on-premise channel, where volumes are now
approximately 44% lower than in 1980. Over the same period, off-premise volume
has increased by approximately 210%. This trend is expected to continue and has
been caused by a number of factors, including changes in consumers’ lifestyles
and an increasing price difference between beer prices in the on-premise
(higher prices) and off-premise (lower prices) channels. Both trends continued
in 2006 with off-premise industry market growth of 3.2% and a decline in the
on-premise market of 4.3%.

There has also been a
steady trend away from ales and towards lager, driven predominantly by the
leading lager brands. In 1980, lagers accounted for 31% of beer sales, and in
2006 lagers accounted for almost 75% of U.K. beer sales. While lager volume has
been growing, ales, including stouts, have declined during this period, and
this trend has accelerated in the last few years. The leading beer brands
are generally growing at a faster rate than the market. The top 10 brands now
represent approximately 66% of the total market, compared to only 34% in 1995.

Our Competitive Position

Our beers and flavored alcohol beverages compete not
only with similar products from competitors, but also with other alcohol
beverages, including wines, spirits and ciders. With the exception of stout,
where we do not have our own brand, our brand portfolio gives us strong
representation in all major beer categories. Our strength in the growing lager
category with Carling, Grolsch, Coors Fine Light Beer and C2 positions us well
to take advantage of the continuing trend toward lagers. Our portfolio has been
strengthened by the introduction of a range of imported and speciality beer
brands, such as Sol, Zatec, Palm and Kasteel Cru.

Our principal competitors
are Scottish & Newcastle U.K. Ltd., Inbev U.K. Ltd. and
Carlsberg U.K. Ltd. We are the U.K.’s second-largest brewer, with a
market share of approximately 21% (excluding factored brands sales), based on
AC Nielsen information. This compares to Scottish & Newcastle
U.K. Ltd.’s share of approximately 24%, Inbev U.K. Ltd.’s share of
approximately 19% and Carlsberg U.K. Ltd.’s share of approximately 12%. In
2006 CBL achieved a small increase in its share of the U.K. beer market and two
of our three core brands—Carling and Coors Fine Light Beer—increased their
product category share in 2006.

Global Intellectual
Property

We own trademarks on the
majority of the brands we produce and have licenses for the remainder. We also
hold several patents on innovative processes related to product formula, can
making, can decorating and certain other technical operations. These patents
have expiration dates through 2021. We are not reliant on royalty or other
revenue from third parties for our financial success. Therefore, these
expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our business.

Inflation

Inflation is typically a
factor in the segments in which we operate, although we periodically experience
inflationary trends in specific areas, such as fuel costs, which were
significantly higher in 2006 when compared to prior years. Inflation in diesel
fuel costs impacts the U.S. segment most significantly due to the geographic
size of the U.S. market and the concentration of production at fewer facilities.
The U.S. segment is also the most exposed to inflation in aluminum prices,
since it packages the majority of its product in aluminum cans.


Regulation

Canada

In Canada, provincial
governments regulate the production, marketing, distribution, sale and pricing
of beer, and impose commodity taxes and license fees in relation to the
production and sale of beer. In 2006, Canada excise taxes totaled $552.5
million or $66.71 per barrel sold. In addition, the federal government
regulates the advertising, labeling, quality control, and international trade
of beer, and also imposes commodity taxes, consumption taxes, excise taxes and
in certain instances, custom duties on imported beer. Further, certain
bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government,
provincial governments and certain foreign governments, especially with the
United States, affect the Canadian beer industry.

United States

In the United States, the beer business is regulated
by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern many parts of
our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation,
distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. To operate our
facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and
approvals from various governmental agencies, including the U.S. Treasury
Department; Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau; the U.S. Department of
Agriculture; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; state alcohol regulatory
agencies as well as state and federal environmental agencies.

Governmental entities also
levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. U.S. federal excise taxes on malt beverages are currently $18 per
barrel. State excise taxes also are levied at rates that ranged in 2006 from a
high of $32.10 per barrel in Alaska to a low of $0.60 per barrel in Wyoming. In
2006, U.S. excise taxes totaled $417.6 million or $17.79 per barrel sold.

Europe

In the United Kingdom, regulations apply to many parts
of our operations and products, including brewing, food safety, labeling and
packaging, marketing and advertising, environmental, health and safety,
employment, and data protection regulations. To operate our breweries and carry
on business in the United Kingdom, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits
and licenses from local Licensing Justices and governmental bodies, including
Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC); the Office of Fair Trading;
the Data Protection Commissioner and the Environment Agency.

In 2007, a smoking ban in public places will take
effect across the remainder of Great Britain. The ban will come into force on April 2,
2007 in Wales, April 30, 2007 in Northern Ireland and July 1, 2007 in
England and is expected to have a significant unfavorable volume impact in the
on-premise channel in the short-term but potentially increase volume in the
off-premise market as consumers adjust their consumption patterns to the new
environment. A ban already exists in Scotland and Republic of Ireland and in
these geographies the experience was as we have outlined in our expectation for
Wales, Northern Ireland and England.

The U.K. government levies
excise taxes on all alcohol beverages at varying rates depending on the type of
product and its alcohol content by volume. In 2006, we incurred approximately
$1.1 billion in excise taxes on gross revenues of approximately $2.5
billion, or approximately $104.58 per barrel.


Environmental
Matters

Canada

Our Canadian brewing operations are subject to
provincial environmental regulations and local permit requirements. Each of our
Canadian breweries, other than the St. John’s brewery, has water treatment
facilities to pre-treat waste water before it goes to the respective local
governmental facility for final treatment. We have environmental programs in
Canada including organization, monitoring and verification, regulatory
compliance, reporting, education and training, and corrective action.

Molson sold a chemical
specialties business in 1996. The company is responsible for certain aspects of
environmental remediation, undertaken or planned, at the business sites. We
have established provisions for the costs of these remediation programs.

United States

We are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Lowry
Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver
(Denver) and is managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste
Management). In 1990, we recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, a
portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with
Denver and Waste Management regarding then outstanding litigation. Our
settlement was based on an assumed remediation cost of $120 million (in
1992 adjusted dollars). The settlement requires us to pay a portion of future
costs in excess of that amount.

Considering uncertainties at the site, including what
additional remedial actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies, and
what costs are included in the determination of when the $120 million
threshold is reached, the estimate of our liability may change as facts further
develop. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any such change, but
additional accruals could be required in the future.

We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of
our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby
activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently
unaware.

From time to time, we have
been notified that we are or may be a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws for the cleanup
of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the
environment. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the
environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved,
we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over
a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our
operating results, cash flows or our financial or competitive position. We
believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and
estimable.

Europe

We are subject to the
requirements of government and local environmental and occupational health and
safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations did not
materially affect our 2006 capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position, and we do not anticipate that they will do so in 2007.

Employees and
Employee Relations

Canada

Molson has approximately
3,000 full-time employees in Canada. Approximately 67% of this total workforce
is represented by trade unions. Workplace change initiatives are continuing and
as a result, joint


union
and management steering committees established in most breweries are focusing
on customer service, quality, continuous improvement, employee training and a
growing degree of employee involvement in all areas of brewery operations. The
agreement governing our relationship with 100 employees at the Edmonton brewery
is set to expire in 2007. We believe that relations with our Canada employees
are good.

United States

We have approximately
3,800 employees in our U.S. segment. Less than 1% of our U.S. work force is
represented by unions. We believe that relations with our U.S. employees are
good.

Europe

We
have approximately 2,750 employees in our Europe segment. Approximately 23% of
this total workforce is represented by trade unions, primarily at our Burton-on-Trent
and Tadcaster breweries. The agreements do not have expiration dates and
negotiations are conducted annually. We believe that relations with our Europe
employees are good.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
Factors

The reader should carefully consider the following
factors and the other information contained within this document. The most
important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:

Risks
specific to our Company

If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a
matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved,
even if beneficial to the Company or favored by other stockholders.

Pentland and the Coors Trust, which together
control more than two-thirds of the Company’s Class A Common and
Exchangeable stock, have voting trust agreements through which they have
combined their voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock
and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. However, in the event
that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted
to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting
trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A
exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is
no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential
deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors
Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a
stockholder vote, we may be unable to complete the transaction even if our
board, management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficial
for Molson Coors.

Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the
success of three primary products in three mature markets; the failure or
weakening of one or more could materially adversely affect our financial
results.

Although we currently have 14 products in
our U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 71% of our U.S. segment’s
sales volume for 2006. Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the United
Kingdom and represented more than 77% of our European segment’s sales volume in
2006. The combination of the Molson Canadian and Coors Light brands represented
more than 42% of our Canada segment’s sales volume in 2006. Consequently, any
material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands, or from the
categories in which they compete, would have a disproportionately large adverse
impact on our business. Moreover, each of our three major markets is mature,
and we face large competitors who have greater financial, marketing and
distribution resources and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and
brand portfolios.

We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation
to our stockholders’ equity, which could hinder our ability to adjust to rapid
changes in market conditions or to respond to competitive pressures.

As of December 31, 2006, we had
approximately $850 million in debt primarily related to our acquisition of
CBL and $1.1 billion of debt primarily related to our Merger with Molson.
As a result, we must use a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay
interest on our debt. If our financial and operating performance does not
generate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities, our operations could
be adversely impacted.

We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the
packaging we need to operate our business. The inability to obtain materials
could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products.

For our U.S. business, we purchase most of our
paperboard and container supplies from a single supplier or a small number of
suppliers. This packaging is unique and is not produced by any other supplier.
Additionally, we are


contractually obligated to purchase substantially all
our can and bottle needs in the United States and Canada from our container
joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC)
and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). Consolidation of
the glass bottle industry in North America has reduced local supply
alternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. CBL has a
single source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any of these
suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to
develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Our primary production facilities in Europe and the
United States are located at single sites, so we could be more vulnerable than
our competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural
disasters.

Our primary production facility in the United
States is in Golden, Colorado, and in Europe, our primary production facility
is located in Burton-on-Trent, England. In both segments, our competitors have
multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As a
result, we must ship our products greater distances than some of our
competitors, making us more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel,
as well as the impact of any localized natural disasters should they occur.

The termination of one or more
manufacturer/distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on
our business.

We manufacture
and/or distribute products of other beverage companies, including those of one
or more competitors, through various licensing, distribution or other
arrangements in Canada and the United Kingdom. The loss of one or more of these
arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or more
reporting segments.

Because we will continue to face intense global
competition, operating results may be unfavorably impacted.

The
brewing industry is highly competitive and requires substantial human and
capital resources. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce
prices, increase capital and other expenditures or lose sales volume, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
In addition, in some of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially
greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than Molson
Coors has. In all of the markets where Molson Coors operates, aggressive
marketing strategies by our main competitors could adversely affect our
financial results.

Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or
failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Our business is highly regulated by federal,
state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding
such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling,
advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with
distributors, environmental matters, smoking bans at on-premise locations and
other matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result
in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals. In
addition, changes in tax, environmental or any other laws or regulations could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our consolidated financial statements are subject to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound
and the Canadian dollar.

We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn
revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly in Canada
and in the United Kingdom. Since our financial statements are presented in USD,
we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into USD at
current exchange rates. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will
affect, perhaps adversely, the value of these items in our financial
statements, even if their local currency value has not changed.

Our operations face significant commodity price change
and foreign exchange rate exposure which could materially and adversely affect
our operating results.

We use a large volume of agricultural and
other raw materials to produce our products, including barley, barley malt,
hops, various starches, water and packaging materials, including aluminum and
paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel


fuel in our operations. The supply and price of these
raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our
control, including market demand, global geo-political events (especially as to
their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel
prices), frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors
affecting growth decisions, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the
foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging, our results of
operations could be materially and adversely impacted. We have active hedging
programs to address commodity price and foreign exchange rate changes. However,
to the extent we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including if
our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in
foreign currency rates or commodity price risks, including price risk
associated with diesel fuel and aluminum, both of which are at historically
high price levels, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.

We could be adversely affected by overall declines in
the beer market.

Consumer
trends in some global markets indicate increases in consumer preference for
wine and spirits, as well as for lower priced, value segment beer brands in some
Canadian markets, which could result in loss of volume or a deterioration of
operating margins.

Because of our reliance on a single information
technology service supplier, we could experience significant disruption to our
business.

We rely exclusively on one information
technology services provider worldwide for our network, help desk, hardware and
software configuration. If that service provider fails and we are unable to
find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly
administer our information technology systems.

Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in
the United Kingdom and Canada, we could be significantly affected by labor
strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.

Approximately 67% of Molson’s total workforce
and approximately 23% of CBL’s total workforce is represented by trade unions.
Although we believe relations with our employees are good, stringent labor laws
in the United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience
labor disruptions in that market.

Changes to the
regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact
our business.

In 2006, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that certain state regulations of interstate wine shipments
are unlawful. As a result of this decision, states may alter the three-tier
distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of our
products. Changes to the three-tier distribution system could have a materially
adverse impact on our business. Further, in certain Canadian provinces, our
products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated
and regulated by provincial government regulators. If provincial regulation
should change, effectively eliminating the distribution channels, the costs to
adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our
business.

Risks
specific to our Discontinued Operations

Indemnities
provided to the purchaser of 83% of the Kaiser business in Brazil could result
in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges.

On January 13, 2006, we agreed to sell a
68% equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA for $68 million cash, including the
assumption by FEMSA of Kaiser-related debt and certain contingencies. In November 2006,
we divested our remaining 15% ownership interest in Kaiser and received $15.7
million, resulting in an increase of FEMSA’s purchased ownership of Kaiser to
83%. The terms of our 2006 agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for
exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies and certain
purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our
control, and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicial
proceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. It is possible that we
will have to make cash outlays to FEMSA with regard to these indemnities. While
the fair values of these indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on
our balance sheet in conjunction with the sale, we could incur future statement
of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our fair
value estimates or change in assessment of probability of loss on these items.
Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these
contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity
liabilities and corresponding statement of operations charges/credits could
result in the future.


Risks
specific to the Canada Segment

We may be required to provide funding to the entity
that owns the Montréal Canadiens hockey club and the related entertainment
business pursuant to the guarantees given to the National Hockey League (NHL).

Pursuant to certain guarantees given to the
NHL as a minority owner of the entertainment business and the Montréal
Canadiens professional hockey club (majority ownership sold by Molson in 2001),
Molson may have to provide funding to the Club (joint and severally based on
our 19.9% ownership) to meet its obligations and its operating expenses if the
Club cannot meet its obligations under various agreements.

An adverse result in a lawsuit brought by Miller could
have an adverse impact on our business.

In
December 2005, Miller Brewing Company sued the Company and several subsidiaries
in a Wisconsin federal court. Miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement
allowing Molson Canada the sole distribution of Miller products in Canada.
Miller claims U.S. and Canadian antitrust violations and violations of the
Agreement’s confidentiality provisions. Miller also claims that the Agreement’s
purposes have been frustrated as a result of the Molson Coors Merger. If Miller
were to prevail in this action, it could have an adverse impact on our business,
and we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of
the $112.0 million carrying value of our intangible asset associated with
the Miller arrangements.

If we are unsuccessful in maintaining licensing,
distribution and related agreements, our business could suffer adverse effects.

We manufacture and/or distribute products of
other beverage companies in Canada, including those of one or more competitors,
through various licensing, distribution or other arrangements. The loss of one
or more of these arrangements could adversely impact our business.

If the Maritime
Provinces refuse to recognize our new brewery in Moncton, New Brunswick, as a “local
brewer,” we will not be able to use that facility as planned.

We are completing a brewery in Moncton,
New Brunswick. We decided to build it on the basis of assurances from Canada’s
Maritime Provinces (which include New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) that the
facility would qualify as a “local brewer,” under the Maritime Accord so that
beer shipped to other Maritime Provinces would be subject to much lower
handling fees than beer shipped from elsewhere in Canada. There is risk that
certain Maritime Provinces will not honor their previous assurances. If so, our
return on investment would be substantially lower than planned, and we may be
required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of the $25.2 million
spent to construct the brewery.

Risks
specific to the U.S. Segment

Litigation directed at the alcohol beverage industry
may adversely affect our sales volumes, our business and our financial results.

Molson Coors and other brewers and distilled
spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising
practices and underage consumption. The suits allege that each defendant
intentionally marketed its products to “children and other underage consumers.”
In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and
guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will vigorously
defend these lawsuits, several of which have been dismissed and are now on
appeal. It is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss, if any, that may result from these lawsuits.

We are highly
dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our
products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our
products.

We sell all of our products in the United
States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributors
are at a competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largest
distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete
with our products. These distributors may give our competitors’ products higher
priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory
environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors.
Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or
inefficient distributors, our business, financial position and results of
operation may be adversely affected.


Risks
specific to the Europe Segment

Sales volume trends in the United Kingdom brewing
industry reflect movement from on-premise channels to off-premise channels, a
trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability.

We have noted in recent years that beer volume
sales in the U.K. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to
retail stores (off-premise), for the industry in general. The progression to a
ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the U.K. anticipated
to be effective in 2007 is likely to accelerate this trend. Margins on sales to
off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise
customers, hence these trends could adversely impact our profitability.

Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub
chains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achieve favorable
pricing.

The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away
from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom.
These larger entities have stronger price negotiating power, and therefore
continuation of this trend could impact CBL’s ability to obtain favorable
pricing in the on-premise channel (due to spillover effect of reduced
negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In
addition, these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more
of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored
business. Further consolidation could impact us adversely.

We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in
England, Wales and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products.

We
are a party to a joint venture with DHL called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles all
of the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, except
where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam
were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find
a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant
disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact.

We are reliant on a single third party as a supplier
for kegs in the United Kingdom.

Our
CBL business uses kegs managed by a logistics provider who is responsible for
providing an adequate stock of kegs as well as their upkeep. Due to greater
than anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees (attributable to
reduced overall volume), the logistics provider has encountered financial
difficulty. As a result of action taken by the logistics provider's lending
institution, related to perceived financial difficulties of the borrower, the
logistics provider has been forced into administration (restructuring
proceedings) and the bank, on February 20, 2007, exercised its option to
put the keg population to CBL. As a result, we expect to purchase the existing
keg population from the logistics provider's lender at fair value pursuant to
the terms of the agreement between CBL and the logistics provider’s lender. We
estimate that this potential capital expenditure, which may be financed over a
period of time in excess of one year, could amount to approximately $70 million
to $100 million, which is not included in the 2007 capital expenditures
plan. As a result of this capital requirement, we may reduce other elements of
our 2007 capital expenditures plan, or offset risk posed by the potential keg
purchase through increased cash generation efforts.

We may incur
impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets
that have indefinite useful lives.

In
connection with various business combinations, we have allocated material
amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets
that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. These assets are tested
for impairment at least annually, using estimates and assumptions affected by
factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating
performance. In the event that the adverse financial impact of current trends
with respect to our U.K. business continue and including the potential impact
of an expected smoking ban in on-premise locations across the whole of the U.K.
in 2007 are worse than we anticipate, we may be required to record impairment
charges. This could be material and could adversely impact our results of
operations.

ITEM 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Beginning in May 2005, several purported class
actions were filed in the United States and Canada, including Federal courts in
Delaware and Colorado and provincial courts in Ontario and Québec, alleging,
among other things, that the Company and its affiliated entities, including
Molson Inc., and certain officers and directors misled stockholders by
failing to disclose first quarter (January-March) 2005 U.S. business
trends prior to the Merger vote in January 2005. The Colorado case has
since been transferred to Delaware and consolidated with one of those cases. One
of the lawsuits filed in Delaware federal court also alleges that the Company
failed to comply with U.S. GAAP. The Company will vigorously defend the
lawsuits.

In May 2005, the Company was contacted by the
Central Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
Denver (the SEC) requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other
information from the Company and Molson Inc. relating primarily to
corporate and financial information and communications related to the Merger,
the Company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2005 and other
information.  In November 2006, the
Company received a letter from the SEC stating that this matter (In the Matter
of Molson Coors Brewing Company, D-02739-A) has been recommended
for termination, and no enforcement action has been recommended to the
Commission. The information in the SEC’s letter was provided under the
guidelines in the final paragraph of Securities Act Release No. 5310.

The Company was contacted by the New York Stock
Exchange in June 2005, requesting information in connection with events
leading up to the Company’s earnings announcement on April 28, 2005, which
was the date we announced our first quarter 2005 losses attributed to lower
sales and the Merger. The Exchange regularly conducts reviews of market
activity surrounding corporate announcements or events and has indicated that
no inference of impropriety should be drawn from its inquiry. The Company cooperated
with this inquiry. As a matter of policy, the Exchange does not comment
publicly on the status of its investigations. However, we have not been
contacted by the NYSE with respect to this investigation in approximately 18
months. If there were any formal action taken by the NYSE, it would be in
the form of an Investigatory Panel Decision. Such Decisions are publicly
available.

In July 2005, the Ontario Securities Commission
(Commission) requested information related to the trading of MCBC stock prior to
April 28, 2005, which was the date we announced our first quarter 2005
losses attributed to lower sales and the Merger. The Company cooperated with
the inquiry. The Commission has advised the Company that it has closed the file
on this matter without action of any kind.

In early October 2006, the Audit Committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors concluded its investigation of whether a complaint
that it received in the third quarter of 2005 had any merit. The complaint
related primarily to disclosure in connection with the Merger, exercises of
stock options by Molson Inc. option holders before the record date for the
special dividend paid to Molson Inc. shareholders before the Merger (which
were disclosed in the Company’s Report on Form 8-K dated February 15,
2005), statements made concerning the special dividend to Molson Inc.
shareholders and sales of the Company’s common stock in connection with
exercise of stock options by the Company’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer following the Merger, after the release of the year-end
results for Coors and Molson Inc. and after the Company lifted the trading
restrictions imposed before the Merger. The Audit Committee’s independent
counsel, which was retained to assist in conducting the investigation, reviewed
and discussed with the staff of the SEC the various findings of an
approximately 12-month long investigation conducted by the independent
counsel. The Audit Committee determined, after thoroughly reviewing the facts,
and in consultation with its independent counsel, to conclude the


investigation. In
concluding the investigation, the Audit Committee determined that the various
matters referred to in the complaint were without merit.

In December 2005, Miller Brewing Company sued the
Company and several subsidiaries in a Wisconsin federal court. Miller seeks to
invalidate a licensing agreement (the Agreement) allowing Molson Canada the
sole distribution of Miller products in Canada. Miller also seeks damages for
U.S. and Canadian antitrust violations, and violations of the Agreement’s
confidentiality provisions. Miller also claimed that the Agreement’s purposes
have been frustrated as a result of the Merger. The Company has filed a claim
against Miller and certain related entities in Ontario, Canada, seeking a
declaration that the licensing agreement remains in full force and effect. We
are currently in discussions with Miller regarding a resolution of this
dispute. There can be no assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution.

In late October 2006, Molson Canada received a
letter from Foster’s Group Limited providing twelve months’ notice of its
intention to terminate the Foster’s U.S. License Agreement due to the Merger. The
Agreement provides Molson Canada with the right to produce Foster’s beer for
the U.S. marketplace. In November 2006, Molson Canada filed a notice of
action in Ontario, Canada disputing the validity of the termination notice. In December 2006,
Foster’s filed a separate application in Ontario, Canada seeking termination of
the Agreement. Molson Canada will vigorously defend its rights in these
matters.

Molson Coors and many other brewers and distilled
spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising
practices and underage consumption. The suits have all been brought by the same
law firm and allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to “children
and other underage consumers.” In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an
undefined class of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money
damages. In each suit, the manufacturers have advanced motions for dismissal to
the court. Several of the lawsuits have been dismissed on appeal. There have
been no appellate decisions. We will vigorously defend these cases and it is
not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if
any, related to these lawsuits.

CBL replaced a bonus plan in the United Kingdom with a
different plan under which a bonus was not paid in 2003. A group of employees
pursued a claim against CBL with respect to this issue with an employment
tribunal. During the second quarter of 2005, the tribunal ruled against CBL.
CBL appealed this ruling, and the appeal was heard in the first quarter of
2006, where most impacts of the initial tribunal judgments were overturned. However,
the employment appeal tribunal remitted two specific issues back to a new
employment tribunal. CBL appealed the employment appeal tribunal’s judgment. In
January 2007, the appeal decision was ruled in the Company’s favor,
holding that the employment tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the employees’
claims, and the claims were dismissed. It is possible that the employees may
attempt to advance their claims in a different forum.

We are involved in other
disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business.
While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these
proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, none of
these disputes and legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these
or other matters, including the above-described advertising practices
case, may arise from time to time that may harm our business.

ITEM 5.

Market
for the Registrant’s Common Equity and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Class B non-voting common stock is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “TAP.”  Prior to the Merger, our Class B
non-voting common stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the
symbol “RKY” (since March 11, 1999) and prior to that was quoted on the
NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “ACCOB.”

In connection with the Merger and effective February 9,
2005,  we now have Class A and Class B
common stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “TAP A”
and “TAP,” respectively, and on the Toronto Stock Exchange as “TAP.A” and “TAP.B,”
respectively. In addition, our indirect subsidiary, Molson Coors Canada Inc.,
has Exchangeable Class A and Exchangeable Class B shares trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols “TPX.A” and “TPX.B,” respectively.
The Class A and B exchangeable shares are a means for shareholders to
defer tax in Canada and have substantially the same economic and voting rights
as the respective common shares. The exchangeable shares can be exchanged for
Molson Coors Class A or B common stock at any time and at the exchange
ratios described in the Merger documents, and receive the same dividends. At
the time of exchange, shareholders’ taxes are due. The exchangeable shares have
voting rights through special voting shares held by a trustee, and the holders
thereof are able to elect members of the Board of Directors. See Note 2 in
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information on the
exchange ratios used to effect the Merger.

The Merger was effected by
the issuance of Adolph Coors Company stock for Molson, Inc. stock in a
transaction that was valued at approximately $3.6 billion. Coors is
considered the accounting acquirer, although the transaction is viewed as a
merger of equals by the two companies. The transaction is discussed in Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The approximate number
of record security holders by class of stock at February 20, 2007, is as
follows:

Title of class

Number of record security holders

Class A common stock, voting, $0.01 par value


Class B common
  stock, non-voting, $0.01 par value

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Summary

Our income from continuing operations for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006 was $373.6 million compared to income from
continuing operations of $230.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 25,
2005. Our net income for 2006 was $361.0 million, or $4.17 per diluted share,
compared to net income for 2005 of $134.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share. Net
sales for 2006 were $5.8 billion on 42.1 million barrels of beer sold,
versus $5.5 billion on 40.4 million barrels sold in 2005. The merger with
Molson was completed on February 9, 2005; consequently, a portion of the
growth in volume, revenue and


profit is due to the
inclusion of the Canada segment for the full year in 2006, versus forty-five
and one-half weeks for the year ended 2005. Also, our 2006 fiscal year included
53 weeks, compared to 52 weeks in 2005. The 53

rd

week in our fiscal 2006 increased total
company sales volume by approximately 600 thousand barrels and pre-tax profit
by approximately $6 million.

Our performance in
2006—our second year as a merged company—demonstrated that our brand growth
strategies and cost-reduction efforts continue to strengthen our competitive
capabilities and financial performance. We achieved revenue and profit growth,
despite substantial competitive and inflationary cost challenges in each of our
major markets. We achieved several critical successes in 2006:

·

We
grew volume in all of our businesses on the strength of our leading brands.

·

We
gained market share in the U.S. and U.K. and improved our Canada share trends
substantially versus the pre-merger trend that Molson experienced.

·

We
increased revenue per barrel in Canada and in the U.S., supported by our
brand-building efforts.

·

We
captured more than $104 million of cost reductions across our company,
including nearly $66 million of merger synergies—more than 60% above our
original synergies goal for 2006.

·

We
continued to invest strategically behind our brand equities and in our sales
execution capabilities in each of our businesses.

·

We
invested in capital and other projects, most significantly in the Shenandoah
brewery in the U.S., that will help us to continue to reduce our fixed-cost
structure and grow earnings and financial flexibility.

·

We
generated $833.2 million of operating cash flow and repaid all commercial paper
borrowings and all borrowings under our credit facility by the end of the year.

We achieved these results
with a focus on building strong brands while controlling and reducing costs across
our company.

Synergies and other cost savings initiatives

The Company originally
targeted $40 million of annual Merger-related savings for 2006. During the
course of the year, we increased our target to $60 million, and achieved $66
million in annual synergies during 2006. Combined with the $59 million of
synergy savings achieved in 2005, we have captured a total of $125 million of
synergies over the past two years. We expect to exceed the total synergies goal
of $175 million during 2007. Moreover, we are developing and implementing a
next generation of cost savings initiatives, which are in varying stages of
development.

Income taxes

Our full year effective
tax rate was 17.5% in 2006 and 17.0% in 2005. Our 2006 effective tax rate was
significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the
following:  lower income tax rates
applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses; and one-time benefits from
revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions
in foreign income tax rates. Our 2005 effective tax rate was lower than the
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower income tax rates
applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses and a one time benefit resulting
from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our
election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 25,
2005, as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 “

Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas

” and SFAS 109
“

Accounting for Income Taxes.”


Components of our Statement of Operations

Net
sales—

Our

net sales represent almost
exclusively the sale of beer and other malt beverages, the vast majority of
which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell
certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. We
also sell certain “factored brands,” as a distributor, to on-premise customers
in the United Kingdom (Europe segment).

Cost
of goods sold—

Our

cost of goods sold include
costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials,
such as barley, in the United States and United Kingdom where we manufacture
the majority of our own malt. In Canada, we purchase malt from third parties.
Hops and various grains are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our
segments. Packaging materials, including costs for glass bottles, aluminum and
steel cans, and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods
sold. Our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor,
freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, and other manufacturing overheads.

Marketing,
general and administrative—

These

costs include
media advertising (television, radio, print), tactical advertising (signs,
banners, point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs planned and executed on
both local and national levels within our operating segments. These costs also
include our sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This
classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions
such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology, which
consist primarily of labor and outside services.

Special
Items—

These

are unique, infrequent and
unusual items which affect our statement of operations, and are discussed in
each segment’s Results of Operations discussion.

Interest
income (expense)—

Interest

costs associated with
borrowings to finance our operations are classified here. Interest income in
the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers.

Other
income (expense)—

This

classification includes
primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to
brewing and selling beer. For instance, gains or losses on sales of
non-operating assets, our share of income or loss associated with our ownership
in Tradeteam and the Montréal Canadiens hockey club, and certain foreign
exchange gains and losses are classified here.

Discussions of statement
of operations line items such as minority interests, discontinued operations
and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in
detail elsewhere in MD&A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

Discontinued Operations

The Company’s
former Brazil business, Kaiser, which was acquired as part of the Merger, is
reported as a discontinued operation due to the sale of a 68% controlling
interest in the business on January 13, 2006. Proceeds from the sale were
$68 million cash, less $4.2 million of transaction costs. We divested
our remaining 15% interest in Kaiser during the fourth quarter, for which we
received $15.7 million, including $0.6 million of accrued interest. The loss
from discontinued operations of $12.5 million for the year ended 2006 is
composed of the following components:

·

Losses
generated by Kaiser prior to the sale of $2.3 million.

·

A
loss on the January 2006 sale of 68% of the business of $2.8 million.

·

Unfavorable
adjustments to indemnity liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations and
changes in estimates of $3.0 million.

·

A
net loss of $4.4 million as a result of the exercise of the put option on our
remaining 15% common ownership interest. The net result of a gain from the
proceeds from the exercise of our put


option was more than
offset by a loss due to the increase in our indemnity liabilities as a result
of purchaser’s increased ownership level. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

During 2005, Kaiser generated pre-tax losses of
$91.8 million, due to operating losses and special charges associated with
increasing reserves for contingent liabilities.

In conjunction with this
transaction, the purchaser (FEMSA) assumed $63 million of financial debt
and assumed contingent liabilities of approximately $260 million, related
primarily to tax claims, subject to our indemnification. We have a level of
continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of Kaiser, as
well as previously disclosed but less than probable unaccrued claims, due to
certain indemnities provided to FEMSA pursuant to the sales and purchase
agreement. While we believe that all significant contingencies were disclosed
as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on Kaiser’s financial
statements, resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise
disclosed amounts could, under some circumstances, result in additional cash
outflows for Molson Coors because of transaction-related indemnity
provisions. We have recorded these indemnity liabilities at fair value and have
a carrying value at December 31, 2006, of $111.0 million. Due to the
uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these
contingencies, there could be significant adjustments in the future.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Molson Coors has adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

” (FIN
47) under which companies must recognize potential long-term liabilities
related to the eventual retirement of assets. As a result of adopting FIN 47,
we recorded a cumulative non-cash expense of $3.7 million, after tax, in
the 2005 fourth quarter, reported as Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
in the Company’s statement of operations. As reported in our  2005 fourth quarter and full year results,
these liabilities represent accumulated remediation and restoration costs
expected to be incurred up to 30 years in the future for anticipated asset
retirements. Costs related to FIN 47 were not significant in 2006, and
following this cumulative catch-up expense recorded in the fourth quarter of
2005, we do not expect FIN 47-related expense to have a significant
impact on our annual operating results.

Results of
Operations

Canada Segment

Before the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of
Coors Brewing Company’s 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada Partnership (CCP),
through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. CCP contracted
with Molson for the brewing, distribution and the sale of Coors Light products,
while CCP managed all marketing activities in Canada. In connection with the
Merger, CCP was dissolved into the Canadian business. Coors accounted for its
interest in CCP using the equity method of accounting.

Following the Merger, our Canada segment consists
primarily of Molson’s beer business including the production and sale of the
Molson brands, Coors Light and other licensed brands, principally in Canada.
The Canada segment also includes our joint venture arrangements related to the
distribution of beer in Ontario Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated
under FIN 46R) and the Western provinces Brewers’ Distributor Ltd. (BDL).

Foreign currency impact on results

Our Canada segment (as
stated in USD) benefited from a 6% year-over-year increase in the value of the
CAD against the USD in 2006 versus 2005. Similarly, the Canada segment
benefited from a 7% year-over-year increase in the value of CAD against USD in
2005 versus 2004.

Net sales

For the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006, sales
volume in Canada increased by 11.1% to 8.3 million barrels versus prior year
volume of 7.5 million barrels for the fiscal period beginning February 9,
2005 and ended December 25, 2005. On a pro forma basis, sales volume
increased 1.6% to 8.3 million barrels versus 2005 pro forma volume of 8.1
million. The 53

rd

week in 2006 accounted for approximately 130
thousand barrels, providing the year-over-year increase.

On a pro forma basis, Molson strategic brands grew at
mid-single-digit rates, lead by Coors Light, Rickard’s and our partner import
brands, all of which grew at double-digit rates on a full year basis. These
increases were partially offset by declines in unsupported brands and other
premium brands, reductions in contract packaging of non-owned brands for export
shipment and

the
discontinuation of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria

.

On a full year basis, 2006 net sales revenue grew
$266.3 million or 17.4% versus prior year. On a comparable, pro forma basis,
net sales revenue grew $165.9 million or 10.2% with approximately 1% growth in
local currency on a per barrel basis.

For the full year, net sales revenue was $216.57 per
barrel, an increase of 8.4% over comparable 2005 net sales revenue of $199.77
per barrel. An approximate 6% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD
during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately $115 million. The
remainder of the increase was driven by the year over year impact of modest
general price increases and improved sales mix from increased import sales,
which are at higher than average retail prices. These improvements were
partially offset by increased price discounting during the year, predominantly
in Ontario and Québec.

For the year ended December 25, 2005, pro forma
net sales were $1.6 billion, 6.5% higher than the comparable period in the
prior year. Net sales revenue per barrel grew slightly in local currency for
the year ended December 25, 2005, driven by modest general price increases
offset by unfavorable product mix. Net unfavorable sales mix was driven by
value segment growth, primarily in Ontario and Alberta, which was partially
offset by improved import sales at higher than average sale prices.

Canada segment net sales
volume for the year ended December 25, 2005, decreased 1.1% to 8.2 million
barrels on a comparable pro forma basis from 2004. The decrease was driven by
volume declines in the first quarter, partially offset by strong industry
volume trends and improved sales activity and market performance over the
balance of 2005.

Cost of goods sold and gross profit

Cost of goods sold increased $92.8 million, or 11.7%,
in 2006 versus prior year. On a comparable, pro forma basis, cost of goods sold
increased $65.4 million or 8.0%, decreasing slightly less than 1% on a per
barrel basis in local currency.

Cost of goods sold was $106.7 per barrel, an increase
of 6.2% over 2005’s pro forma cost of goods sold of $100.43 per barrel. After
adjusting for the approximate 6% appreciation in the value of CAD

against USD, cost of goods sold decreased
by slightly less than 1% in 2006 in local currency. Inflationary cost increases
across nearly all inputs drove approximately 3% increase in cost of goods sold per
barrel. These and other cost increases were completely offset by implementation
of synergies and other cost savings initiatives, lower input costs related to
favorable foreign currency, and lower employee-related expenses in


2006.
Finally, a 1% reduction was due to a $4 million benefit in the fourth quarter
of 2006 related to a one-time non-cash adjustment of certain foreign currency
positions to their market values.

On a pro forma basis, cost
of goods sold increased 5.9% to $818.3 million for the year ended December 25,
2005, from $772.5 million in the same period for 2004. For the same
period, in local currency, cost of goods sold per barrel in Canada decreased as
synergy and other cost savings were offset by unfavorable product mix.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expenses
increased $62.4 million for 2006. This is an increase of $14.5 million or 3.4%
on a comparable, pro forma basis. In local currency, total marketing, general
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 3.5% due to lower
promotional spending and brand investments in 2006, due in part to cycling of
the promotional launch of Molson Kick and A Marca Bavaria in 2005, and partly
to offset price discounting. These costs were partially offset by higher
employee expenses and one-time costs in 2006, including incremental spending as
a result of the additional week in 2006 results.

On a pro forma basis,
marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 24.2% to
$425.5 million for 2005, from $342.6 million in the same period for
2004. Canada increased 2005 marketing and sales spending at a high-single-digit
growth rate. In local currency general and administrative costs increased due
to higher depreciation, increased employee costs and non-recurring items,
partially offset by Merger-related synergies.

Special items, net

There were no special items in 2006.

Special items, net of
$5.2 million in 2005 were attributable primarily to restructuring the
sales and marketing organizations in Canada. On a pro forma basis, special items,
net in 2004 of $20.4 million were Merger-related, and therefore did not
recur in 2005.

Other (expense) income, net

In 2006, other income increased $15.4 million over the
prior year. On a pro forma basis other income increased $14.7 million over the
prior year or $16.8 million in local currency. Other income primarily
represents equity earnings and amortization expense related to the Montréal
Canadiens hockey club (the Club), which improved over the prior year. During
the year, the entities which control and own a majority of the Club purchased
the preferred shares in the Club held by Molson. In addition, Molson was
released from a direct guarantee associated with the Club’s debt financing, and
as a result of the reduction in our financial risk profile, we have
re-evaluated our remaining guarantee liabilities, specifically under the NHL
Consent Agreement and the Bell Centre land lease guarantees, resulting in an
approximate $9.0 million income benefit associated with the reduction in the
exposure attributable to such guarantees.

Other expense in 2005
represents the equity losses in the Montréal Canadiens Hockey Club.


United States
Segment

The
United States (U.S.) segment produces, markets, and sells the Coors and Molson
portfolios of brands in the United States and its territories and includes the
results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain
Bottle Corporation (RMBC) joint ventures consolidated under FIN 46R. The U.S.
segment also includes Coors brand volume that is sold in Mexico and the
Caribbean.

Net sales

Sales volume to wholesalers grew 3.6% in 2006 compared
to 2005.  Without the 53rd week in 2006,
volume growth would have been approximately 2.2%. The growth was driven by
low-single-digit growth for the Coors Light brand, high-single-digit
growth of Keystone Light, and double-digit growth of the Blue Moon brand.
Excluding our Caribbean business, which was impacted by a weak economy and a new
sales tax enacted in Puerto Rico during the year, our 50-states
sales-to-retail (STRs) grew 3.7% from a year ago. Coors Light achieved its
seventh consecutive quarter of total channel U.S. growth and grew share in the
grocery and convenience store channels (according to external retail sales data
reports). This continued volume momentum was driven by building our brand
equities, through our Coors Light advertising “Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment”
focus, as well as better alignment with our distributor network and improving
our effectiveness with chain retail accounts.

Net sales per barrel increased 2.1% in 2006 due to
higher base pricing and reduced discounting compared to the level of price
promotion activity we experienced during 2005. However, the overall industry
environment continues to be challenging, as price realization for the major
brewers continues to


lag inflation. In
addition, product mix was slightly unfavorable due primarily to the volume
increases in our Keystone brands in 2006.

Full year U.S. sales volume increased in 2005 versus
2004, driven by volume increases in the Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue
Moon brands, and the addition of Molson brands sold in the United States that
were included in U.S. results following the Merger.

Net sales per barrel
increased 1.3% from 2004 to 2005. We experienced favorable gross pricing in
2005, partially offset by significant price promotions and coupon activity in
key markets. These pricing factors accounted for approximately one-half of the
increase in revenue per barrel, while the balance of the revenue per barrel
growth was due primarily to collection of fuel surcharges from customers and
higher sales of import brands through company-owned distributorships.

Cost of goods sold

Cost of goods sold
per barrel increased by 4.1% to $70.11 per barrel in 2006 versus $67.35 per
barrel in 2005. The net increase in Cost of goods sold was driven by four
primary factors:

·

Inflationary
increases across nearly all facets of our operations, including packaging
materials, freight rates, fuel and various components of labor and labor-related
costs, resulted in an approximate 5% increase in cost of goods per barrel.
Approximately three-quarters of those inflationary increases are attributable
to commodities, with the balance attributable to labor and labor-related
increases.

·

Innovative
promotional packaging initiatives that are helping to drive sales of Coors
Light and other brands resulted in approximately 1% of the increase. These
include our plastic bottle cooler box, cold wrap bottle, and frost-brew can
liner.

·

Certain
initiatives that will yield lower costs in future years resulted in temporarily
higher costs in 2006 and accounted for approximately 1% of the total increase.
These initiatives included costs related to temporary process changes and new
contract packaging and freight arrangements related to closing our Memphis
brewery in September 2006.

·

Savings
from our operations cost initiatives and Merger synergies reduced costs of
goods sold per barrel by 3% and offset approximately half of the total
inflation cost increases during the year.

Cost of goods sold per
barrel increased by 1.6% to $67.35 per barrel in 2005 from $66.27 per barrel in
2004. The increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by higher
freight, diesel fuel, packaging materials, and utilities costs. Inflation alone
would have accounted for an increase of approximately 4% in cost of goods per
barrel. However, these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable
cost trends from supply chain cost management, labor productivity and Merger
synergies.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expenses
increased by $5.5 million, or 0.7%, in 2006 versus 2005. Our stock-based
long-term incentive program primarily drove the year-over-year increase, along
with modest increases in our advertising and sales expenses. The total increase
was partially offset by reductions of certain overhead and personnel-related
costs.

Marketing, general and
administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 0.5%, in 2005 versus
2004. Increased spending on sales capabilities were partially offset by lower
general and administrative overhead costs.


Special items, net

Special items, net in the U.S. segment in 2006 were
associated primarily with the closure and sale of the Memphis brewery,
completed in the third quarter of 2006. We recorded approximately
$60 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets and impairments
of fixed assets, reflecting their sales value, $12.5 million for accruals
of severance and other costs associated with the plant closure, and a $3.1
million increase in the estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi-employer
pension plan benefiting former Memphis workers. Memphis-related accelerated
depreciation was higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to a lower sales price for the
Memphis plant than our estimate in 2005.

The 2006 special items were partially offset by the
receipt of a $2.4 million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of
a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations
at the Lowry Superfund site in Denver, Colorado. We recorded the cash receipt
as a special benefit consistent with the classification of the charge recorded
in a previous year. The estimated environmental liability associated with this
site was not impacted by the proceeds received. See Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion.

Special items, net in the
U.S. segment in 2005 were associated primarily with the planned closure of the
Memphis brewery in 2006. We recorded $33.3 million in accelerated
depreciation on brewery assets, $3.2 million in direct impairments of
assets, $1.7 million for accruals of severance and associated benefits,
and $25.0 million representing an estimate of costs to withdraw from a
multi-employer pension plan for Memphis workers. We recorded an
additional $4.9 million of restructuring charges associated with
restructuring brewery operations in Golden, Colorado.

Other income (expense), net

Other income was higher in 2006 versus 2005 primarily
due to the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred gain on the sale
of real estate. This amount was recognized in the second quarter of 2006 upon
the satisfaction of certain conditions pertaining to the sale contract.

Other income was lower in
2005 versus 2004, primarily due to two factors in 2004: $11.7 million of
gains on the sale of non-operating real estate and $8.3 million of
royalties in 2004 related to a coal mine previously owned by Coors.


Europe Segment

The
Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands
principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the
production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of
Ireland (consolidated under FIN 46R beginning in 2004), factored brand
sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to
retail by us) and our joint venture arrangement with DHL for the distribution
of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). Our Europe segment also
includes a small volume of sales in Asia and other export markets.

thousand ($4,798 thousand, net of tax), respectively, of the minority owners'
share of income attributable to the Grolsch joint venture.

Foreign currency impact on results

Our Europe segment results
were positively affected by a 1% year-over-year increase in the value of the
British Pound Sterling (GBP or £) against USD in 2006. Conversely, the Europe
segment was adversely affected by a 0.5% year-over-year increase in the value
of the GBP against USD in 2005.

Net sales

Net sales for the Europe segment decreased by 5.0% in
2006, while volume increased by 0.6%. The 53

rd

week in 2006 contributed approximately 140
thousand barrels of sales volume, providing the year-over-year increase. Net
sales in local currency decreased by approximately 6.5%. The 52 week volume
decline was driven by premium lagers, flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) and
ales. This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBL’s
overall volume increase for the year drove a slight market share increase for
the company versus an overall industry decline.


Beer volume in our on-premise business, which
represents approximately two-thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater
proportion of our margin, declined by slightly more than 2% compared
to 2005. This compared to an overall industry on-premise channel decline of
4.3% yielding a small market share gain for CBL. Our off-premise volume for
2006 increased by approximately 2% over 2005, with Carling accounting for most
of the gain. We experienced a small off-premise market share decline in 2006.

In addition to the volume trends mentioned above, we
experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on-premise and the off-premise
channels and a decrease in the sales value of factored brands. These reductions
were compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix. In addition, net sales
were impacted by lower factored brand sales resulting from a change in our
trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer requiring us to
move from gross reporting of sales and cost of goods sold to a net presentation
for that customer, which caused a year-over-year reduction in both net sales
and cost of goods sold of approximately $46 million from 2005, but with no net
impact on gross profit.

Net sales for the Europe segment decreased 19.5% in
2005, while volume decreased 2.9% from the previous year. The volume decline
was driven by the Grolsch brand, flavored alcohol beverages (FABs) and ales.
This decline was partially offset by growth of the Carling brand. CBL’s overall
volume decline for the year was slightly worse than the overall market decline.

Beer volume in our on-premise business declined by 2%
in 2005 compared to 2004. This compared to an overall industry on-premise
channel decline of nearly 4% in the year, yielding a small market share gain
for us. Our off-premise volume for 2005 decreased approximately 2% over 2004,
resulting in a small off-premise market share decline for us.

As in 2006, in addition to the volume trends mentioned
above, we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on-premise and the
off-premise channels, as well as a decrease in the sales value of factored
brands. These reductions were further compounded by unfavorable channel and
brand mix.

The change in our trading arrangements with one major
factored brand customer in 2005 caused a year-over-year reduction in both net
sales and cost of goods sold of $243.4 million from 2004, but with no net
impact on gross profit.

Owned-brand net
sales in local currency per barrel decreased approximately 2% in 2005 when
compared to 2004.

Cost of goods sold

Cost
of goods sold per barrel in local currency

decreased approximately 6% in
2006 versus 2005. The change to net reporting for certain factored brand sales
(described above) accounted for approximately $46 million of the decrease in
the year to date cost of goods sold. The remaining decrease was driven by cost
savings from our supply chain restructuring initiatives begun in 2005 and lower
distribution costs, partly offset by increased energy costs.

Cost of goods sold
decreased 22.6% in 2005 versus 2004. The cost of goods sold decrease in local
currency was driven by the change in trading arrangements with one major
factored brand customer mentioned above combined with a mix shift away from
glass packaged products which have higher packaging costs. These reductions
were partially offset by the de-leveraging of fixed costs, higher distribution
costs and increased energy costs.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses

Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses
decreased by 6.9% with a per barrel decrease of 7.4% in 2006 versus 2005. The
decrease was primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives we announced
and began implementing during 2005 and rigorous cost control throughout the
year.


In 2005, Europe marketing,
general and administrative expenses decreased 3.8%, and 1.0% on a per barrel
basis versus 2004.  This decrease was
primarily the result of lower overhead, sales and marketing and payroll related
spending in response to profit challenges presented by lower revenue per
barrel.

Special items, net

In 2006, special items, net of $9.0 million are a
combination of $13.0 million employee termination costs associated with the
U.K. supply chain and back office restructuring efforts and $1.3 million costs
associated with exiting the Russia market, offset by a $5.3 million
pension curtailment gain. The pension curtailment reflects reductions in
headcount from restructuring efforts and is discussed further in Note 8 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In 2005, special items, net consisted of $14.3 million
for employee termination costs and $3.0 million of income associated with
disposals of long-lived assets, consisting of $6.5 million from gains on sales
of assets and a one-time development profit on real estate formerly held by the
company, offset by asset impairment charges of $3.5 million. Also included in
2005 are $2.5 million of exit costs associated with the closure of our Russia
and Taiwan offices. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for further discussion.

The special items in 2004
represented the profit on sale of real estate.

Other (expense) income, net

Other income of $4.8 million represents a $19.0 million
improvement over 2005, driven by improved Tradeteam profitability, our joint
venture partner for the distribution of product, profits on the sale of surplus
real estate and lower non-operating leasehold expenses.

The decline in other
income in 2005 from 2004 reflects declining Tradeteam operating performance and
increased non-operating leasehold expenses.

Interest income

Interest income is earned
on trade loans to U.K. on-premise customers. Interest income decreased by 9.9%
and 19.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of lower loan balances
versus the prior years.


Corporate

Corporate
includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are
not allocated to the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs
relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate
affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.

attributable to debt obligations of the RMMC and BRI joint ventures.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses

Corporate marketing, general and administrative
expenses in 2006 were $120.2 million, up $34.5 million from 2005. This increase
is a result of a number of factors, including 1) $20 million related to
increased incentive pay, split equally between our stock-based long term
incentive plan, including the effect of adopting FAS123R accounting treatment
for expensing equity-based compensation, and higher incentive pay
resulting from improved profit and cash performance; 2) $7 million related to
investments in projects designed to deliver further cost reductions. These
initiatives are designed to improve and standardize systems, processes and
structure across the areas of operations, information technology, finance and
human resources; 3) approximately $11 million due
to the full ramp up of new and ongoing costs to
build strong corporate center capabilities, which include Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance, corporate governance, finance, legal, commercial development and
human resources, the transfer of global costs from operating segments to
the Corporate center, and severance payments; and 4) approximately
$1 million related to the 53rd week. These increases were partially offset
by $4 million reduction in legal fees resulting from the favorable
completion of several major disputes.


Marketing, general and
administrative (MG&A) expenses were higher in 2005 versus 2004, primarily
due to establishing the new global organization and headquarters, significant
legal fees, information technology projects, and a reallocation of certain
MG&A costs from segments to Corporate to directly support the business units’
long term operating efficiency programs and other strategic objectives.

Special items, net

The Corporate segment
recognized special items, net of $5.3 million and special items, net of
$58.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, and December 25,
2005, respectively. The 2006 net credit was a result of evaluating the December 31,
2006 ending MCBC stock price versus the stock option floor price on stock
options held by former Coors officers who left the Company under change in
control agreements following the Merger offset by associated additional payroll
related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former Coors officer that exercised
stock options under the change in control agreement. The 2005 charges were
associated with 1) $31.8 million of severance and other benefits paid
to 12 former Coors officers who exercised change—in-control rights, 2) $6.9
million were a result of providing an exercise price floor under stock options,
including additional payroll related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former
Coors officer that exercised stock options under the change in control
agreement associated with these potential awards, 3) $14.6 million of
severance and share-based compensation and benefits paid to two former
Molson officers who left the Company during the second quarter of 2005
following the Merger, and 4) $5.0 million of Merger-related
costs that did not qualify for capitalization under purchase accounting. See
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net was $138.5 million during
2006, versus $126.6 million during 2005. Interest expense, net increased due to
higher interest rates on permanent financing (as opposed to short-term
temporary financing in place through September 2005 following the Merger),

rd

week impact and a stronger Canadian dollar and
British Pound Sterling. These increased costs were partially offset by the
benefit of lower overall debt levels due to debt repayments in 2006.

Interest expense, net
nearly doubled in 2005, compared to 2004 due to the addition of Merger-related
debt including debt assumed on Molson’s opening balance sheet which
approximated $1.5 billion. (See related Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8).

Other income (expense), net

Other expense, net in 2006
includes primarily foreign exchange losses, while the other income, net in 2005
includes primarily foreign exchange gains.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of
liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, external borrowings and
asset monetizations. As of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005,
we had working capital deficits of $341.8 million and $768.4 million,
respectively. We commonly operate at working capital deficits given the
relatively quick turnover of our receivables and inventory. Decreased current
liabilities accounted for most of the decrease in working capital deficit for
2006 versus 2005, especially with regard to the current portion of long-term
debt and discontinued operations. Current portion of long-term debt at December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005 was $4.0 million and $334.1 million,
respectively, balances which reflect significant repayments during 2006. We had
total cash of $182.2 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
$39.4 million at December 25, 2005. The higher balances at year-end
2006 reflect excess cash accumulated following the repayment during 2006 of
debt obligations eligible for normal, scheduled repayment. Long-term debt was
$2,129.8 million and $2,136.7 million at December 31, 2006, and December 25,
2005,


respectively.
Remaining debt as of the end of 2006 consists primarily of bonds with
longer-term maturities. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash
provided by short-term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet
our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments
on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our
liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our
products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the
acceptability of alcohol beverages or any of the other factors we describe in
Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of
$833.2 million for the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006, improved by
$411.0 million from the 52 week period ending December 25, 2005. Net
income was higher by $226.1 million in 2006 versus 2005, the reasons for which
are discussed in detail in the Results of Operations discussion in this section.
However, much of the improvement in operating cash flow from 2005 to 2006 was
due to a number of unfavorable items in 2005. Cash paid for income taxes was
lower by $162.7 million during 2006 versus 2005. During the second quarter of
2005, we made a $138 million Canadian tax payment that was driven by the
Merger, a one-time liquidity event that was not repeated in 2006. Our pension
funding in 2006 was lower by $55.1 million primarily due to a special voluntary
funding to the U.S. plan in 2005. Merger-related costs of
$21 million were paid out subsequent to the Merger in the first quarter of
2005 by our Molson business in Canada (costs which had been accrued on the
opening balance sheet as of the merger date), representing a unique cash
outflow not experienced in 2006. We also made payments to officers under change
in control and severance agreements of $24 million in 2005. The remaining
improvement in operating cash flow from 2005 to 2006 is due primarily to Molson’s
Canadian business being included in 2006 for the full 53 weeks versus 45 ½
weeks in 2005, given the merger date of February 9, 2005. We believe that
our cash flow from operating activities in 2006 is more indicative of future
performance than the comparable period of 2005, given the number of unusual
cash outflows occurring in 2005.

Coincident with the sale of the Memphis brewery in September 2006,
we have incurred a $28.1 million liability for the estimated payment
required for our withdrawal from the hourly workers multi-employer pension
plan. We expect to pay approximately $2.4 million through 10 monthly
installments in late 2006 and 2007 and then pay the remaining
$25.7 million in one lump sum payment in September 2007.

Our net cash provided by operating
activities in 2005 was $422 million, a decrease of $78 million from
2004. The addition of Molson’s Canadian beer business made a significant
positive contribution to our operating cash flow. However, there were several
items that offset this increase. First, in early 2005 we made a
$138 million Canadian tax payment triggered by the Merger but previously
deferred by Molson. Our total tax expense for the year was only
$50 million, and there were additional tax payments to other governmental
authorities in addition to the $138 million. Second, we funded
$202 million into our defined benefit pension plans in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom, compared with expense associated with these
plans of $65 million. Finally, operating cash flow in 2005 also diminished
because of unfavorable operating profit in the Europe segment, and severance
and change in control payments to officers who departed the Company following
the Merger.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $294.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower by $17.9 million
compared to the same period in 2005. Additions to properties were higher in
2006 by $40.3 million as compared to 2005, due primarily to spending in Canada
and the U.S. related to the build-out of the Moncton, New Brunswick and
Shenandoah, Virginia breweries. In 2006, we recognized proceeds of
$68.0 million on the sale of 68% of the Kaiser business in Brazil, offset
by $4.2 million of transaction costs. In December 2006, we collected
proceeds of $15.7 million as a result of the exercise of our put


option related to our
remaining 15% ownership of the Kaiser business in Brazil. Proceeds from sales
of properties and intangible assets were lower by $13.3 million year over year.
2005 proceeds included a significant collection of a note related to a 2004
sale of property in the U.K. causing proceeds to exceed 2006 levels, which
included the sale of the Memphis plant in the U.S. and various real estate
sales in the U.K. On June 30, 2006, as part of a general refinancing of
the Montréal Canadiens Hockey team (the Club), Molson sold its preferred equity
interest in the Montréal Canadiens hockey club to entities which control and
own a majority interest in the Club. Total proceeds coincident with the
transaction were CAD $41.6 million (USD $36.5 million). We retain a
19.9% common equity interest in the Club as well as board representation. The
transaction structure is consistent with our long term commitment to the Team
and its success, and helps to ensure the team’s long term presence in Montréal.

Net cash used in investing
activities in 2005 was $313 million, compared to $67 million in 2004.
Capital expenditures were higher by $195 million in 2005 due to the
inclusion of Molson’s Canada segment capital expenditures of $107 million
following the Merger, and spending in the United States related to the
build-out of the Shenandoah facility to a full brewery. We also spent $16.5
million in 2005 to acquire Creemore Springs, a small brewery in Canada, and
spent $20.4 million on transaction costs associated with the Merger. These
factors were offset by the favorable impact of acquiring $73.5 million in cash
with the Merger, the collection of a $35.0 million note receivable related to a
sale of real estate in the U.K. and collecting a net $17 million on trade
loan activity in the U.K. Cash used in investing activities in 2004, which was
prior to the merger, reflected capital expenditures of the U.S. and Europe
segments only, proceeds from the sale of kegs in the U.K. and sales of real
estate in both the U.S. and U.K., and a pension settlement received in 2004
from the former owners of CBL. Also, we presented as an investing activity the
inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began
consolidating during the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the
implementation of FIN 46R.

Financing Activities

Our debt position significantly affects our financing
activity. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this report for a summary of our debt position at December 31, 2006 and
December 25, 2005.

Net cash used for financing activities was
$401.2 million for 2006 compared to $188.8 million of cash used in
financing activities during 2005. Net repayments of debt were approximately
$356.2 million for 2006, encompassing all activity in our various debt and
credit facilities (including those associated with discontinued operations).
Net repayments of debt during 2005 were approximately $108.9 million
(including those associated with discontinued operations). The increased levels
of debt repayment were due primarily to higher level of operating cash flows
generated by the business in 2006 versus 2005.  Proceeds from stock option exercises in 2006
were $83.3 million exceeding 2005 exercises by $28.1 million. Proceeds in
2006 were impacted by significant exercises of stock options during the fourth
quarter.

Net cash used in financing
activities was $188.8 million in 2005, compared to $335.7 million in
2004. During 2005, we paid dividends to stockholders of $110.0 million,
compared to $30.5 million in 2004, as a result of increased shares
outstanding and a revised dividend policy following the Merger. The large
increase in our balance sheet debt from $932 million at year end 2004 to
$2,485 million at year-end 2005 was largely the result of the assumption
of Molson’s outstanding debt as of the Merger date (February 9, 2005).
This debt assumed included borrowings Molson incurred prior to the Merger to
pay the special dividends on Molson stock before the Merger. Substantially all
of our debt pay down occurred after the Merger date. Also, we collected
approximately $11 million less cash in 2005 versus 2004 as a result of
stock option exercises.


Capital Resources

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8, for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings
and available sources of borrowing, including lines of credit.

The vast majority of our remaining debt borrowings as
of December 31, 2006, consist of publicly traded notes totaling $1,918.0
million principal amount, with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2015. Our
remaining debt other than the notes consists of various notes payable of $215.9
million at consolidated joint ventures, which mature in 2011 and 2013. While we
will continue to use commercial paper borrowings, if necessary, to manage our
liquidity through our periods of lower operating cash flow in early 2007, we
expect to reach a point in mid-2007 when we will need to consider
different alternatives for the use of cash generated. We expect to take a
balanced approach to our alternatives in 2007 and beyond, which could include
funding of defined benefit pension plans, prepayments of consolidated joint
venture debt obligations, modest purchases of company stock and preserving cash
flexibility for potential growth investments. Any purchases of MCBC stock on
the open market would require a board-approved plan, which does not currently
exist.

In August 2006, the
available amount of the $1.4 billion revolving multicurrency bank credit
facility was reduced to $750 million, and the expiration date was extended to August 2011.
At December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings outstanding against the
facility. There were no other significant changes in our short or long-term
borrowings.

Credit Rating

As of February 16,
2007, our credit rating with Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s with regard
to our long-term debt was BBB and Baa2, respectively. If the long term debt
ratings were to drop, consequently affecting our short term rating, our access
to the commercial paper market for shorter-term borrowings could be unfavorably
impacted, resulting in either higher interest rates or an inability to borrow
through commercial paper at all. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31,
2006.

Capital
Expenditures

In 2006, we spent approximately $446.3 million
(including approximately $29.3 million spent at consolidated joint
ventures) on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 64%
was in support of the U.S. segment, with the remainder split between the
Canadian (21%), European (14%) and Corporate (1%) segments. The capital
expenditure plan for 2007 is expected to be approximately $320 million,
including approximately $46 million of spending by consolidated joint ventures.
2007 capital spending is expected to be lower than 2006 primarily due to the
planned completion of the Shenandoah brewery in early 2007.

Our CBL business uses kegs managed by a logistics
provider who is responsible for providing an adequate stock of kegs as well as
their upkeep.  Due to greater than
anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees (attributable to reduced
overall volume), the logistics provider has encountered financial difficulty.  As a result of action taken by the logistics
provider's lending institution, related to perceived financial difficulties of
the borrower, the logistics provider has been forced into administration
(restructuring proceedings) and the bank, on February 20, 2007, exercised its
option to put the keg population to CBL. 
As a result, we expect to purchase the existing keg population from the
logistics provider's lender at fair value pursuant to the terms of the
agreement between CBL and the logistics provider’s lender.  We estimate that this potential capital
expenditure, which may be financed over a period of time in excess of one year,
could amount to approximately $70 million to $100 million, which is not
included in the capital expenditures plan of $320 million provided above.  As a result of this capital requirement, we
may reduce other elements of our 2007 capital expenditures plan, or offset risk
posed by the potential keg purchase through increased cash generation efforts.

Advertising and
Promotions

As of December 31,
2006, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including
marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately
$951.8 million over the next five years and thereafter. Our advertising and
promotions commitments are included in other long-term obligations in the
table above.

Pension Plans

Our consolidated, unfunded
pension position at the end of 2006 was approximately $359 million, a
decrease of $441 million from the end of 2005. The funded positions of
pension plans in each of the Canada, U.S. and U.K. improved due to improved
asset returns, higher interest rates (which have the effect of decreasing the discounted
pension liabilities), contributions to the plans, plan changes and reductions
in U.K. staffing levels. Approximately $12 million of the underfunded pension
position at the end of 2006 was the responsibility of the minority owners of
BRI. See discussion below regarding the adoption of

SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”

We fund pension plans to
meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. Sometimes
we voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return
forecasts in any given year. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were
$155 million in 2006, reflecting statutory contribution levels in Canada
and the United Kingdom, and $23 million of voluntary contributions in the
United States. We anticipate making approximately $185 million of both
statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in 2007.

Consolidated pension
expense was $33 million in 2006, a decrease of $32 million from 2005. Decreases
in the U.S. and U.K. of $12 million and $13 million, respectively, were
attributable mainly to higher expected returns on plan assets in 2006 and a
pension curtailment in the U.K.

As a result of employee
restructuring activities associated with the Europe segment supply chain
operations, a pension curtailment was recognized in the second quarter of 2006.
The curtailment triggered a remeasurement of the pension assets and liabilities
as of April 30, 2006. Additionally, as a result of the curtailment, a gain
of $5.3 million was recognized and presented as a special item in the
statement of operations in the second quarter of 2006. This gain arose from the
reduction in estimated future working lifetimes of plan participants resulting
in the acceleration of the recognition of a prior service benefit. This prior
service benefit was generated by plan changes in previous years and was
deferred on the balance sheet and amortized into earnings over the then
expected working lifetime of plan participants of approximately 10 years.
In addition, this curtailment event required a remeasurement of the projected
benefit obligation and plan assets, which resulted in an $11.8 million
reduction in the projected benefit obligation at April 30, 2006 (See Note
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), which was
recognized in other comprehensive income in the second quarter of 2006.

We anticipate pension
expense on a consolidated basis for 2007 to approximate $9 million. This
lower expense amount for 2007, when compared to 2006, reflects an estimated
pension benefit from the U.K. pension plan of approximately $19 million for
2007.


Postretirement Benefit Plans

Our consolidated, unfunded
postretirement benefit position at the end of 2006 was approximately
$402 million, an increase of $25 million from the end of 2005. Benefits
paid under our postretirement benefit plans were approximately $22 million
in 2006 and in 2005. Under our postretirement benefit plans we expect payments
of approximately $24 million in 2007. See discussion below regarding the
adoption of

SFAS No. 158
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”

Consolidated
postretirement benefit expense was $35 million in 2006, an increase of $10
million from 2005, attributable mainly to our Canada segment plans. We
anticipate postretirement benefit expense on a consolidated basis for 2007 of
approximately $31 million.

Contingencies

In the ordinary course of
business or in the course of the sale of a business, we enter into contractual
arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify third-parties from any
losses or guarantees incurred relating to pre-existing conditions for losses or
guarantees arising from certain events as defined within the particular
contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past
performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum
loss clauses. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 under the captions “Environmental,” “Indemnity Obligations—Sale of
Kaiser” and “Montréal Canadiens.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31,
2006, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined
in Item 303(a) (4) (ii) of Regulation S-K).

Outlook for 2007

Canada Segment

Consistent with our
objective to be a brand-led company, we have continued to build a
consumer-preferred portfolio. Our strategic brands grew at mid-single-digit
rates during 2006, led by the continuation of double-digit growth from Coors
Light and our partner import portfolio. This represents the seventh straight
quarter of volume and share growth for Coors Light across all sales regions in
Canada. Rickard’s also has continued its solid growth trend, delivering
double-digit growth. We will leverage this momentum by applying a range of
national and local programs to drive revenue growth in 2007. Our results for
2007 will face a challenging comparison late this year as we cycle the
additional week of 2006 sales volume and corresponding profit in Canada.

With regard to costs in
Canada, we continue to pursue and achieve the original merger synergy targets
and the development of the next phase of our cost reduction initiatives. These
synergies and other cost savings successfully offset about half of our cost
inflation in Canada in 2006. While we expect to continue to reduce the impact
of inflation in 2007 with synergies and other cost savings, cost of goods sold
is expected to increase at a low-single-digit rate per barrel in local
currency. The increase is due to slightly higher expected labor expenses, lower
foreign exchange benefits (associated with USD-denominated costs of goods
inputs) and the impact of cycling non-recurring, non-cash 2006 fourth quarter
benefits.

In addition to packaging
materials, waste reduction, plant productivity and distribution savings, we are
re-organizing our selling, general and administrative functions beginning in January 2007.
This reorganization initiative is focused on labor savings across all
functions, along with reductions in other overhead expenses. The restructuring
will cost approximately $9 million, most of which will be expensed in the first
quarter of 2007, and is expected to have a payback period of slightly over one
year.

We expect continued
competitive pressure in 2007, which calls for a balanced approach between
long-term strategic brand building and tactics to address short-term
competitive activity. In 2006, we redirected


some of
our marketing spending to price promotion, particularly in Ontario and Québec.
In 2007, we plan to increase investment in our strategic brands, driving a
low-single-digit increase in marketing and sales expenses. We will continue to
implement initiatives to attack costs to help fund these investments and build
the long-term brand equities necessary to be successful in the Canada beer
business.

Brewing and/or
distribution agreements with other brewers contribute to our revenue and
profitability. Miller Brewing Company has sued us to invalidate our licensing
arrangement. We are contesting their claim, and currently are in discussions
with Miller regarding a resolution of this dispute. However, there can be no
assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution. A termination of this
contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our
intangible asset associated with the Miller arrangements, which has a carrying
value of approximately $112.0 million at December 31, 2006. During
the fourth quarter of 2006, we received notification from the Foster’s Group
(Foster’s) that they intend to terminate our U.S. production arrangement with
them. We contend that the termination notice is ineffective. A termination of
this contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our
distribution right intangible associated with the Foster’s arrangement, which
has a carrying value of approximately $25.0 million at December 31, 2006. More
generally, the termination of partner brand agreements would have an
unfavorable impact on the profitability of the Canada segment.

Finally, the Canadian
Dollar appreciated about 6% in 2006 against the U.S. dollar, providing a
significant benefit to our full-year earnings as measured in U.S. dollars. However,
if the current trend toward weakening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S.
dollar continues, our 2007 Canada results could be negatively impacted when
viewed in U.S. dollars.

U.S. Segment

Throughout 2006, the U.S.
business built sales momentum by leveraging its key brand equities and taking a
disciplined approach to market, resulting in volume growth for Coors Light,
Keystone and Blue Moon. These brands will remain our primary focus in 2007,
along with some additional focus on developing our regional brands. In 2007, we
will continue to drive sales by building our key retail account business and
furthering our alignment with our distributor network. In the first quarter of
2007, we again leveraged our Coors Light National Football League (NFL)
sponsorship throughout the playoffs, and we expect our distributors to rebuild
inventories of our products in preparation for peak season and the ramp-up of
our new Shenandoah, Virginia brewing capacity. On the other hand, we expect
challenging economic conditions to continue to impact our volume trends in
Puerto Rico. We expect our first quarter results in the U.S. to benefit from a
greater-than-normal distributor inventory build from the low levels after the
New Year’s holiday.

The U.S. beer price
environment improved during 2006. We have seen some progress on front line
pricing in the past several months, and going forward we will continue to take
a disciplined approach to both front line pricing and discounting, while
building our core brand equities to drive growth.

With regard to costs, we
expect continued significant inflation challenges during 2007 in our U.S.
business. Our first quarter cost of goods sold per barrel will increase because
of higher commodity costs, including aluminum and agricultural inputs, partially
offset by lower depreciation expense due to the combined effect of selling the
Memphis brewery last year and not beginning to depreciate most of the Virginia
brewing assets until the second quarter of this year.

In response to these
challenges, we are striving to maximize the benefits of our long-term cost
initiatives, especially merger synergy savings such as the closing of the
Memphis brewery in September 2006 and the opening of our new brewery in
Virginia before peak season 2007. Nonetheless, we do not currently expect the
benefit of our cost initiatives to fully offset inflationary cost increases
under the current outlook for commodities and other inputs. As a result, we
expect U.S. cost of goods to increase at a low-single-digit rate in 2007, a
somewhat smaller increase than in 2006. If aluminum, diesel fuel or other costs
increase substantially, it could present a significant challenge to driving
U.S. profit growth in 2007.


Europe Segment

We were very
successful in reducing costs and achieved total cost savings of more than $40
million in 2006, which were delivered well above our initial expectations and
helped to offset the margin loss that our business sustained during the course
of the year. This impressive work contributed substantially to our earnings
performance in a very challenging 2006 market and is strengthening the
competitive position of this business for the future. The competitive
environment in the U.K. beer industry continues to be challenging with a
difficult retail environment caused by pressure on consumer spending from
increased taxes, interest rates and utility prices that have collectively
impacted disposable incomes. Industry economics also continue to exert downward
pressure on pricing, driven by retailer consolidation and supplier
over-capacity. The overall competitive environment in the U.K. is likely to
worsen in 2007 as smoking bans are implemented in all of the country by
mid-year. Also, our cost savings opportunities are becoming smaller and more
difficult to achieve versus the past two years. We have three main strategies
to address these challenges:

·

First,
we implemented cost reduction initiatives during 2006, and will implement
further initiatives during 2007. Early in 2007, we also anticipate a modest
flow-through of cost savings implemented in the first half of 2006. Cost
savings will become less impactful as we lap the performance of 2006.

·

Second,
we will continue to invest heavily behind our core lager brands—Carling,
Grolsch and Coors Fine Light. We have increased advertising spending around
Carling as part of our new marketing campaign and have received positive
consumer feedback to our outdoor and television advertising. In 2006 we continued
to expand Carling C2, including a launch into the U.K. off-premise channel in
the fourth quarter. C2 is a mid-strength lager, that meets changing consumer
preferences and lifestyles.

·

Third,
at retail we continue to roll out our new cold-dispense technologies and
distinctive above-bar fonts. This rollout extends our cold platform beyond
Carling for a broad group of our strategic brands as we aim to maintain our
leadership in cold dispense. This leading retail innovation is driving sales
with current retailers, along with increased distribution via new retail
outlets. During 2006 we installed 14,000 cold dispense points, and have seen
positive results in those outlets.

We face an on-premise smoking ban in three of our
markets beginning in 2007: in Wales on April 2

nd

, in Northern Ireland on April 30

th

and in England on July 1

st

. We expect them to be detrimental to the
on-premise channel in the short term but potentially to increase the size of
the off-premise market as smokers adjust to the ban. This shift to the
lower-margin off-premise channel likely will offset only a portion of the
negative on-premise volume and profit impact, so the overall impact on volume
and margin will still be negative in 2007. Our experience in other markets has
been that on-premise sales usually recover at least partially in the years
following the implementation of a local smoking ban.

As a part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts across
the organization, we expect to incur restructuring costs of approximately $13
million in 2007. These costs, which largely relate to employee severance, are
expected to have a payback period of approximately one and a half years.

Industry pricing continues
to be the most important source of margin pressure in the U.K. beer business in
both the on- and off-premise. The U.K. business is managing pricing by channel,
in the context of local competition, while staying focused on our core strategy
of building strong brands for the long term.

Corporate

We
expect corporate marketing, general and administrative costs to
be 15% to 20%, or $20 to $25 million, lower in
2007 partially resulting from aggressive cost reductions which
began in the latter part of 2006, contributing $4 to $5 million of cost
savings in 2007. In addition, we anticipate also benefiting from
the elimination of approximately $17 million of costs due to 1)
severance payments; 2) high legal fees


that are
not expected to repeat in 2007 and 3) the elimination of certain
incentive compensation plans and lower expected payments for ongoing plans.
Approximately $8 million of costs that are in direct support of the operating
segments will transfer into the respective segments in 2007, with the
majority transferring to the U.S. segment. These cost reductions will be
offset partially by increased spending related to investments in
projects designed to deliver cost reductions across
all business segments.

Goodwill

Because there is goodwill included in the carrying
value of our three segments, the fair value of the applicable reporting unit
was compared to its carrying value during the third quarter of 2006 to
determine whether there was goodwill impairment. Most of the goodwill
associated with the U.S. and Canada segments originated in the Merger.
Similarly, we tested indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
during the third quarter of 2006, most of which relate to our Canada and Europe
segments.

A portion of the Merger goodwill was allocated to the
U.S. segment, based on the level of Merger synergy savings expected to accrue
to the U.S. segment over time. Our testing during the third quarter of 2006
indicated that the fair values of the reporting units in the U.S. and Canada
exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairments of goodwill in
2006. However, a reduction in the fair value of the U.S. or Canada segment in
the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also have significant
indefinite-lived intangible assets in Canada, associated primarily with
core, non-core and partner beer brands, as well as distribution rights. These
intangible assets were also evaluated for impairment during the third quarter
of 2006, and we determined that their fair values exceeded their carrying
values. A reduction in the fair values of these intangibles could lead to
impairment charges in the future. Reductions in fair value could occur for a
number of reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable
beer pricing environment, declines in industry or company-specific beer
volume sales, termination of brewing and/or distribution agreements with other
brewers.

The goodwill associated
with the Europe segment originated in the 2002 purchase of the CBL business by
Coors. Our testing during the third quarter of 2006 indicated that the fair
value of the CBL reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no
impairments of goodwill. However, a slight reduction in the fair value of the
CBL reporting unit in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. We also
have a significant indefinite-lived intangible asset in Europe,
associated with the Carling brand, which was also tested in the third quarter
of 2006, and no impairment was warranted. Future reductions in the fair value
of the Europe business or of specific intangibles could occur for a number of
reasons, including cost increases due to inflation, an unfavorable beer pricing
environment, and declines in industry or company-specific beer volume
sales, which could result in possible impairment of these assets.

Interest

We estimate that corporate
interest expense in 2007 will be approximately $115 to $119 million,
excluding U.K. trade loan interest income.

Tax

Our tax rate is volatile
and may fluctuate with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or
loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.  On February 21, 2007, the Canadian government
enacted a tax technical correction bill that will result in a one-time,
non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of
2007.  As a result, we anticipate that
our 2007 effective tax rate on income will be in the range of 6% to 11%. Absent
this tax law change and resulting benefit, and with no other changes in tax
laws or company tax structure, we would expect that our effective tax rate
would be in the range of 25% to 30%.  We
note, however, that there are other pending


tax law
changes in Canada that if enacted, would result in further reductions in the
range of our 2007 effective tax rate.

Other

The company
anticipates that expense related to depreciation and amortization of assets
will decline approximately 10% in 2007 versus 2006 excluding special items, due
to the net effect of five factors:

·

Substantial
existing assets will have been fully depreciated, so expense related to these
assets is expected to be significantly lower in 2007 than 2006.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
or U.S. GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on-going basis. The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
By their nature, estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actual results may
differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to
our financial condition and results of operations:

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority
of our employees in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. We also
have postretirement welfare plans in Canada and the United States that provide
medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for
certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance
provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

” (SFAS
87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “

Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions

” (SFAS 106). These statements require that
management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on
plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses,
salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other
assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension
and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are
highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. See
discussion below regarding


the adoption of

SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”

We performed an analysis
of high quality corporate bonds at the end of 2006 and compared the results to
appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in
determining our pension liabilities in Canada, the United States, and the
United Kingdom for the year ended December 31, 2006. Discount rates and
expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given
fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year. A 50 basis point change
in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2006 would have had the
following effects on 2006 pension expense:

The
Canada, U.S. and U.K. plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with
smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. Equity assets are
well diversified between domestic and other international investments, with
additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to
large-cap, small-cap and growth and value investments. Relative allocations
reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following

Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves

We estimate the range of liability related to
environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss
can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is
considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the
potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates.
Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or
efficiency of Company-owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent
future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental
costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. See
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves at
December 31, 2006.

We sold 68% of the Kaiser business in
January 2006 and divested our remaining 15% ownership interest by
exercising a put option in November 2006. While we reduced our risk
profile as a result of this transaction, we retained risk by providing
indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax,
labor and civil contingencies in general. These are referenced in the
section called “Contingencies” above and discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8. We account for these indemnity obligations
at fair value in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

This rule requires us to carry the guarantee liability on the balance
sheet at its fair value. We do not amortize these liabilities, but rather make
periodic estimates of their fair values, and record material changes in the
values through discontinued operations on the statement of operations.

We use multiple
probability—weighted scenarios in determining the fair values of indemnity
liabilities. As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8, we have recorded a fair value liability of $77.7 million
related to contingencies associated with purchased tax credits based on a total
exposure of $246.8 million with regard to those liabilities. Our estimates
assume equally likely scenarios (i.e., 50%-50%) of 1) no payments ever
occurring and 2) a payment of the full exposure in a future year with a
potential refund in a number of years following the initial payment. If our
estimate were adjusted to assume a 75% probability of some payment occurring
(rather than 50%), the value of the liability would increase by $36.9 million
to $114.6 million.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation

We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and we
evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that
certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
these assets may not be recoverable. We completed the evaluations of goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the


third quarter of 2006.
With regard to goodwill, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their
carrying values, allowing us to conclude that no impairments of goodwill have
occurred. With regard to our indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair
values of the assets also exceeded their carrying values. Significant judgments
and assumptions were required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible
assets for impairment.

In 2006 we standardized our method for determining fair value,
using a combination of discounted cash flows analyses and evaluations of values
derived from market comparable transactions and market earnings multiples. This
represents a change from cash flow analyses used in isolation in the prior
year. We believe that this consistent methodology across all reporting units
and the inclusion of evidence provided through market data and comparable
transactions will improves the accuracy and consistency of this analysis. Our
cash flow projections are based on various long-range financial and operational
plans of the Company and considered, when necessary, various scenarios, both
favorable and unfavorable. In 2006, discount rates used for fair value
estimates for reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 9.5%. These rates are driven
by, among other factors, the prevailing interest rates in geographies where
these businesses operate as well as the credit ratings and financing abilities
and opportunities of each reporting unit. Discount rates used for testing of
indefinite-lived intangibles ranged from 9% to 10%. These rates
largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations, with some
level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves.
Our reporting units operate in relatively mature beer markets, where we are
reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. Changes in the factors
used in the estimates, including the discount rates used, could have a
significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units and, consequently,
may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

We use derivatives in the normal course of business to
manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material
prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do
not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We record
our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at
fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and
interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 138 and 149” (SFAS
133), which we early adopted on December 28, 1998. Such accounting is
complex, as evidenced by significant


interpretations of the
primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the
significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in
the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation
methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of
different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

Our market-sensitive derivative and other
financial instruments, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate
swaps, and cross currency swaps. See discussions also in Item 7A, “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We monitor foreign exchange
risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques,
value-at-risk and sensitivity analysis.

We use value-at-risk to monitor the foreign exchange
and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. The value-at-risk
methodology provides an estimate of the level of a one-day loss that may be
equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange
rate and interest rate-sensitive financial instruments. The type of
value-at-risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the
fair value is a variance/covariance method. The value-at-risk model assumes
normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling
techniques that can be used to compute value-at-risk. The computations used to
derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates
and interest rates. The correlations have been determined by observing foreign
exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent
one-year period. We have excluded anticipated transactions, firm commitments,
cash balances and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign
currencies from the value-at-risk calculation, some of which these instruments
are intended to hedge.

Value-at-risk is a statistical measure of risk that
estimates the loss that may be experienced with a given level of confidence
over a given period of time. Specifically, as reported herein, value-at-risk is
the maximum expected one-day loss at 95% confidence, that is, only 5% of the
time or 1 day in 20 is the loss expected to exceed the value-at-risk. Value-at-risk
is not intended to represent actual losses that may occur, nor does it
represent the full extent of losses that may occur. Actual future gains and
losses will differ from those estimated by value-at-risk because of changes or
differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge
percentages, timing and other factors.

The one-day value-at-risk at 95% confidence of our
cross currency swaps was $10.6 million, $12.2 million and
$10.7 million at December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26,
2004, respectively. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of
the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap.
Value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely
by increases in the value of our inter-company loan, the underlying
transaction being hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to
the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate
our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a
hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of the applicable
rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with
reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ
significantly from the results presented in the table below.


The
following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis, which
reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable
market interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices of our
derivative and debt portfolio:

Income Tax Assumptions

We account for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “

Accounting for Income Taxes

” (SFAS 109).
Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for
which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax
provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax
provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our
estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision
in the period in which such changes are enacted.

We have historically provided U.S. deferred income
taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
During 2005, we assessed our corporate financing position with respect to all
our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have elected to treat our portion of
all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 31, 2006, as permanently
reinvested. Under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109, we
recorded a tax provision benefit in the third quarter of 2005 totaling
$44 million, representing the reversal of a previously established
deferred tax liability in our U.K. subsidiary. As of December 31, 2006,
approximately $1.0 billion of retained earnings attributable to international
companies was considered to be permanently re-invested. The Company’s intention
is to reinvest the earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it
is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the amount of
incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. However,
the Company believes that U.S. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any
U.S. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

(FIN 48), which
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to
determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position
must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon
examination. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit
to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective as of the
beginning of our 2007 fiscal year.

We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting
FIN 48 on our financial statements.  While we have not concluded our analysis, we
anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will increase tax-related liabilities
(or decrease tax-related assets) by a minimum of $40 million, which could
increase upon adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the new requirement
will be reflected as an adjustment to


retained earnings in the
period of adoption (first reflected in the first quarter of 2007). We expect
that the requirements of FIN 48 may add volatility to our effective tax rate,
and therefore our expected income tax expense, in future periods.

We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely
than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to
realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded
amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the
period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would
not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future,
an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the
period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance
related to the Merger with Molson or the acquisitions of CBL that relate to
deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill, unless the
reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would
impact earnings.

Consolidations under FIN 46R

RMMC and RMBC are
dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were
formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass
container businesses. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide
a long-term relationship with that brand’s owner in a key segment of the U.K.
beer market. We also consolidate the financial position and results of Brewers
Retail, Inc. (BRI), which is 52% owned by Molson, and provides all
distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of Ontario in Canada. Our
ownership of BRI is determined by our market share in the province of Ontario. Our
market share and ownership percentage could be reduced as a result of lower
trade or consolidation of certain of our competitors. During the
first quarter of 2007, press reports have indicated that a certain
competitor offered to purchase another competitor in the province of Ontario. If
this were to occur, we may need to consider whether BRI should continue to be
consolidated in our financial statements.

Adoption of New
Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Interpretation
No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 47—”Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”),
which clarifies the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”).
Specifically, FIN 47 provides that an asset retirement obligation is
conditional when either the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation
is conditioned on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably
estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a
conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement
of the liability when sufficient information exists.

We adopted FIN 47 on December 25, 2005, which
resulted in an increase to properties of $0.5 million, goodwill of $2.2
million, minority interest of $1.1 million, and liabilities of $9.6 million
related to asset retirement obligations. For asset retirement obligations
related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of Molson Inc. as of February 9,
2005, such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the
acquisition by $2.2 million as such properties were recorded at the appraised
fair market value at the acquisition date. These asset retirement obligations
relate primarily to clean-up, removal, or replacement activities and related
costs for asbestos, coolants, waste water, oils and other contaminants
contained within our manufacturing properties.


The adoption of FIN 47 was reflected in our financial
statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with
the catch-up adjustment of $3.7 million, net of tax benefit of $2.2 million, in
the 2005 statement of operations. This adjustment represents a depreciation
charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated,
which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related
long-lived assets, through December 25, 2005.

Inherent in the fair value
calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and
judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit
adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal,
regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future
revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset
retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the
asset balance. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount
of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. The net
value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro-forma
basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to December 25,
2005 and December 26, 2004 were $9,628,580 and $5,926,852, respectively.

SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based Payment”

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R
(SFAS 123R) was issued in December 2004 and became effective for us
in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments
to qualified individuals, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their grant
date fair values. Prior to the adoption, under the guidance for qualifying
stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, we presented
pro forma share-based compensation expense for our stock option program in the
notes to our financial statements. We have elected to use the modified prospective
application method of implementing SFAS 123R, which does not require
restatement of prior periods. Under the modified prospective application
method, awards that are granted, modified, or settled after adoption of
SFAS 123R are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 123R. Unvested equity-classified awards that were granted prior to
the adoption of SFAS 123R will continue to be accounted for in accordance
with SFAS 123, except that the fair value amounts are recognized in the
statement of operations and are subject to the forfeiture provisions of
SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
(SAB 107) to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation
challenges of SFAS 123R. In particular, SAB 107 provides supplemental
implementation guidance on SFAS 123R, including guidance on valuation
methods, classification of compensation expense, inventory capitalization of
share-based compensation cost, income tax effects, disclosures in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis and several other issues. We applied the principles of
SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter
of 2006.

SFAS 123R requires a calculation of the APIC Pool
balance consisting of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share—based
compensation. FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards

(FSP 123R-3), which was issued on November 10,
2005, provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the
tax effects of share-based payment awards to employees. Specifically, this FSP
allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the
opening APIC Pool balance. We have adopted such alternative method provisions
to calculate the beginning balance of the APIC Pool in the financial statements
ended December 31, 2006. This adoption did not have any impact on our
financial statements.

The effect of adoption of
SFAS 123R in 2006 was an additional expense of $6.1 million pretax,
$4.4 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share.  The adoption of SFAS 123R led us to evaluate
different types of instruments as share based awards and we use a combination
of restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, deferred stock
awards and limited stock appreciation rights. As of December 31, 2006,
there was $67.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based


compensation
arrangements granted under the plans, related to unvested shares. This
compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.5 years. (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)

SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs”

SFAS 151 is an
amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that became effective for us in the
first quarter of 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage
requiring immediate recognition in the period they are incurred. The adoption
of this standard had no impact on our financial results.

SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Corrections”

SFAS 154 replaces APB
Opinion No. 20 and SFAS 3 and became effective for us in the first quarter
of 2006. The standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply
accounting principle changes to prior years’ comparative financial statements
as if the Company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle.
Changes in depreciation, amortization and depletion methods previously considered
a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in estimate under
SFAS 154, requiring prospective adoption. New pronouncements may contain
specific implementation guidance which would supersede the requirements of SFAS
154. The adoption of SFAS 154 did not have an impact on the financial
statements included herein.

FASB Staff Position
(FSP) No. FIN 45-3 “Application of FASB Interpretation No. 45
to Minimum Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business or its Owners”

FSP FIN 45-3 is an
amendment to FIN 45 requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value
of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a
business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period
of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. The FSP is effective for
new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified beginning in the first
quarter of 2006. We currently do not maintain arrangements with minimum revenue
guarantees that have a significant impact on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 158 “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

SFAS 158 was issued in September 2006 and is
effective for our annual fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The
standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132R, requires an
employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension and/or
other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position. Funded status is the difference between the projected
benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets for defined benefit
pension plans, and is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation
and the market value of plan assets (if any) for other post retirement benefit
plans. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded
status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive
income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 158, liabilities related to our
defined benefit pension and postretirement plans increased by $245 million and
our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related deferred income
taxes, decreased by approximately $172 million as of December 31, 2006. A
portion of the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to
the adoption of SFAS 158 will be recognized into the statement of income as a
component of net period pension benefit cost. Such amount will be approximately
$19.3 million before tax, in 2007.  See
Notes 1, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of SFAS 158.


In addition, this
statement requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at the date
of their year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions.
This measurement date provision will be effective for our annual 2008 year end
and is unlikely to have an impact to the Company’s financial statements as we
currently measure plan assets and obligations as of our fiscal year-end.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 “Considering the
Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements

)”

The SEC issued SAB 108 in
September 2006 and it is effective for our fiscal 2006 year. SAB 108
requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors
on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using
both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach
quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the
current year statement of operations. Thus, this approach ignores the effects
of correcting the portion of the current period balance sheet misstatement that
originated in prior periods. The iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements
based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance
sheet at the end of the current period, irrespective of the misstatement’s
period(s) of origin. Financial statements would be required to be adjusted
when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material.
Correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not
require previously filed reports to be amended. Our adoption of SAB 108 did not
impact the financial statements presented herein.

New Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 155 “Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”

SFAS 155 was issued
in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2007 fiscal year. Among other factors, SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting
for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting
for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS
155 will have a significant impact on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 156 “Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140”

SFAS 156 was issued
in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2007 fiscal year. The new standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 140,
will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities by addressing
the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and
liabilities and providing an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like
accounting. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 156 will have a
significant impact on our financial statements.

FASB’s Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 06-03
“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net
Presentation)”

In June 2006, the
FASB ratified a consensus on the EITF Issue No. 06-03 (EITF 06-03)
related to the classification of certain sales, value added and excise taxes
within the income statement. This EITF would become effective for us in the
first quarter of our fiscal year 2007. We do not expect that the adoption of
EITF 06-03 will have a significant impact on our financial statements.

FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

In July 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two-step


process
to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax
position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be
sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not”
to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of
benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective as of
the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year.

We are continuing to
evaluate the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements. While we
have not concluded our analysis, we anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will
increase tax-related liabilities (or decrease tax-related assets) by a minimum
of $40 million and could increase upon adoption. The cumulative effect of
applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to retained
earnings in the period of adoption (first reflected in the first quarter of
2007). We expect that the requirements of FIN 48 may add volatility to our
effective tax rate, and therefore our expected income tax expense, in future
periods.

SFAS No. 157 “Fair
Value Measurements”

SFAS 157 was issued
in September 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2008 fiscal year. This standard clarifies the definition of fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about
fair value measurements. We are still in the process of reviewing the impact,
if any, that SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

In February 2007, the
FASB issued Statement No. 159 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities
to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective
of this Statement is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial
instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets
and liabilities using different measurement techniques. The fair
value measurement provisions are elective and can be
applied to individual financial instruments. SFAS 159 requires
additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included in the
entity’s financial statements. This Statement is effective for us as of
the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We have not yet determined if
we will elect to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of this
Statement and what impacts such adoption might have on our financial
statements.

Related Party Transactions

Transactions with
Management and Others

We employ members of the
Coors and Molson families, who collectively owned 84% of the voting A shares,
common and exchangeable stock of the Company after the Merger and throughout
2006. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and
compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all
employees of the Company.

As of December 31,
2006, various Coors family trusts collectively owned approximately 42% of our Class A
common and exchangeable stock, approximately 13% of our Class B common and
exchangeable stock, and approximately 30% of Graphic Packaging Corporation’s
(GPC) common stock.

Certain Business
Relationships

We purchase a large
portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from GPC, a related party. Our
payments under the GPC packaging agreement in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled
$73.6 million, $75.3 million and $104.5 million, respectively.
Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $0.8 million and $2.8 million at December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively.


ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production
and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern
the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial
instruments. By policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of
trading or speculation.

Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging
materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows
affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this
objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps,
interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the
opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of
net investments in foreign-currency-denominated operations or
translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency
exposures are Canadian dollar (CAD), British pound sterling (GBP or £) and
Japanese yen (JPY).

Derivatives are either exchange-traded
instruments or over-the-counter agreements entered into with highly rated
financial institutions. No losses on over-the-counter agreements due to
counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over-the-counter agreements are
entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (Standard & Poor’s)
or A2 (Moody’s). In some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal
collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of
certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the
form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss
position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 31,
2006, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us.

Details
of all other market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments,
including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments
include long-term fixed rate debt, foreign currency forwards, commodity swaps,
interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. See related value-at-risk
and sensitivity analysis in the

Prior to issuing the bonds on September 22, 2005
(See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), we
entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of the Canadian offering.
The bond forward transaction effectively established, in advance, the yield of
the government of Canada bond rates over which the Company’s private placement
was priced. At the time of the private placement offering and pricing, the
government of Canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked
in with the Company’s interest rate lock. This resulted in a loss of $4.0
million on the bond forward transaction. Per FAS 133 accounting, the loss will
be amortized over the life of the Canadian issued private placement and will
serve to increase the Company’s effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points
compared to the stated coupon on the issue.


Simultaneouslywith the U.S. private placement we
entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire USD $300 million
issue amount and for the same maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our
$300 million for a CAD $355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms
of the transaction are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of
4.28% to the third party on the amount of CAD $355.5 million and will receive
interest at a rate of 4.85% on the $300 million amount. There was an exchange
of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent
exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated
this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated
with the payment of interest and principal on the USD securities. Consistent
with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due to
foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of operations and will
be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the
value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other
comprehensive income.

(2)

The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate
swaps, converting CAD $100 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating
rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the inception
of the swaps. These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

(3)

We are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling
GBP £530 million (approximately USD $774 million at prevailing foreign currency
exchange rates in 2002, the year we entered into the swaps). The swaps included
an initial exchange of principal in 2002 and will require final principal
exchange on the settlement date of our 6 3/8% notes due in 2012 (see Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). The swaps also call for
an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At
the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received GBP.
Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive USD. The
cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges.

(4)

We are a party to interest rate swap agreements related
to our 6 3/8% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million
notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will
receive fixed USD interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 6 3/8% per annum
and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the
three-month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a
floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception
of the swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the
changes in the fair value of $201.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rates. See accounting method discussion in Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

(5)

We are a party to a cross currency swap totaling CAD
$30 million (approximately USD $25.7 million at prevailing foreign currency
exchange rates in 2005, the year we entered into the swap.) The swap included
an initial exchange of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap also
calls for an exchange of fixed CAD interest payments for fixed USD interest
receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and
received CAD. Upon final exchange, we will provide CAD to the counterparty and
receive USD. The cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge
of the changes in value of the future CAD interest and principal receipts that
results from changes in the USD to CAD exchange rates on an intercompany loan
between two of our subsidiaries. In addition, in September of 2006 we
entered into a cross currency swap totaling GBP £24.4 million (approximately
USD $47.8 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2006). The
swap included an initial exchange of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The
swap calls for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed CAD
interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid CAD to a
counterparty and received GBP. The cross currency swap has been designated as a
cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and
principal receipts that result from changes in the CAD to GBP exchange rates on
an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. See accounting method
discussion in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT
TO STOCKHOLDERS

The preparation, integrity and objectivity of the
financial statements and all other financial information included in this
annual report are the responsibility of the management of Molson Coors Brewing
Company. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, applying estimates based on
management’s best judgment where necessary. Management believes that all
material uncertainties have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed.

The established system of accounting procedures and
related internal controls provide reasonable assurance that the assets are
safeguarded against loss and that the policies and procedures are implemented
by qualified personnel.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, provides an objective, independent audit of
the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial
reporting. Their accompanying report is based upon an examination conducted in
accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), including tests of accounting procedures, records and internal
controls.

The
Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee composed of
independent, outside directors, monitors the Company’s accounting control
systems and reviews the results of the Company’s auditing activities. The Audit
Committee meets at least quarterly, either separately or jointly, with

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Molson Coors Brewing Company:

We have completed
integrated audits of Molson Coors Brewing Company’s consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Molson Coors Brewing Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index under Item 15(a) (2) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005 and the manner
in which it accounts for share-based compensation and defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans in 2006.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment
and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing


and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MOLSON COORS
BREWING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis
of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged
with Molson Inc. (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, Adolph Coors
Company became the parent of the merged Company and changed its name to Molson
Coors Brewing Company. Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description
of us includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC or the “Company”), principally
a holding company, and its operating subsidiaries: Coors Brewing Company (CBC),
operating in the United States (U.S.); Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating
in the United Kingdom (U.K.); Molson Canada (Molson), operating in Canada;
and our other corporate entities. Any reference to “Coors” means the Adolph
Coors Company prior to the Merger. Any reference to Molson Inc. means
Molson prior to the Merger. Any reference to “Molson Coors” means MCBC after
the Merger.

Unless otherwise
indicated, information in this report is presented in U.S. dollars (USD or $).

Our Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is a 52-
or 53-week period ending on the last Sunday in December. The
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, was a 53-week period and
fiscal years ended December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 were 52-week
periods.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial
statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled
domestic and foreign subsidiaries, as well as entities consolidated under FASB Interpretation
No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—An
Interpretation of ARB 51

(FIN 46R). All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Reporting Periods Presented

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include the results of Molson and
Kaiser (presented as a discontinued operation) prior to the Merger on February 9,
2005. Further, the results of Kaiser and our joint venture, Brewers
Retail Inc. (BRI), consolidated under FIN 46R, are reported one month
in arrears since the date of the Merger for this and future reporting periods.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, Kaiser’s results include the results
for December 2005 through January 13, 2006, (the date of the sale)
and for the year ended December 25, 2005, Kaiser’s results include the
results for February 9, 2005 (the date of the merger) through November 2005.
For the year ended December 25, 2005, BRI’s results include the results
for February 9, 2005, (the date of the Merger) through November 2005.

Use of Estimates

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles require
us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the
estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, based on information
available at the time they are made. To the extent there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated
financial statements may be affected.


Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications
have been made to the 2005 and 2004 financial statements to conform to the 2006
presentation.

Revenue Recognition

Depending upon the method of distribution, revenue is
recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred
to the customer or distributor, which is either at the time of shipment to
distributors or upon delivery of product to retail customers.

In Canada, revenue is recognized when the significant
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or distributor,
which is either at the time of shipment to distributors or upon delivery of
product to retail customers.

In the United States, customers are principally
independent distributors or wholesalers. Revenue is recognized when product is
shipped and the risk of loss transfers to the distributors or wholesalers.

Revenue is recognized in the Europe segment when
product is received by our customers, who are principally independent retailers
in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, excise taxes are included in the
purchase price we pay the vendor on beverages for the factored brands business
purchased from third parties for resale, and are included in our net sales and
cost of goods sold when ultimately sold.

In all segments, the cost of various programs, such as
price promotions, rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of
sales. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms.
Revenue is stated net of incentives, discounts and returns.

Outside of unusual
circumstances, if product is returned, it is generally for failure to meet our
quality standards, not caused by customer actions. Products that do not meet
our high quality standards are returned and destroyed. We do not have standard
terms that permit return of product. We estimate the costs for product returns
and record those costs in cost of goods sold each period. We reduce revenue at
the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is
returned.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold
includes beer raw materials, packaging materials (including promotional
packaging), manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads,
inbound and outbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs,
inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.

Equity Method Accounting

We generally apply the equity method of accounting to
20% to 50% owned investments where we exercise significant influence, except
for certain joint ventures that must be consolidated as variable interest
entities under FIN 46R. These investments primarily involve equity ownership in
transportation services in our Europe segment (Tradeteam) and an investment in
the Montréal Canadiens in Canada.

There are no related
parties that own interests in our equity method investments as of December 31,
2006.

Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses

Our marketing, general and
administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising, sales staff
costs, and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. The creative
portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs
are generally expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense
was $906.9 million, $729.1 million, and $627.4 million
for years 2006, 2005, and 2004,


respectively.
Prepaid advertising costs of $46.8 million ($43.8 million in current
and $3.0 million in long-term) and $23.3 million ($16.7 million
in current and $6.6 million in long-term) were included in other current
assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively.

Trade Loans

CBL extends loans to retail outlets that sell our
brands. Some of these loans provide for no interest to be payable, and others
provide for payment of a below market interest rate. In return, the retail
outlets receive smaller discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased
from us, with the net result being CBL attaining a market return on the
outstanding loan balance. We therefore reclassify a portion of beer revenue
into interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. In
2006, 2005 and 2004 this amount was $11.7 million, $13.1 million and
$16.0 million, respectively. We have included this interest income in the
Europe segment since it is related solely to CBL.

Trade loan receivables are
classified as either other receivables or non-current notes receivable in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2006, and December 25,
2005, total loans outstanding, net of allowances, were $99.7 million and
$95.9 million, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Canada’s distribution channels are highly regulated by
provincial regulation and experience few collectibility problems. However,
Canada does have direct sales to retail customers for which an allowance is
recorded based upon expected collectibility and historical experience.

In the U.S. segment, our allowance for doubtful
accounts and credit risk is insignificant, as the majority of the U.S. segment
accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors
with whom collection occurs through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the
United States, we secure substantially all of our product sale credit risk with
purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal
guarantees and other letters of credit.

Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to
retail customers and, because of the industry practice of making trade loans to
customers, our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At
CBL, we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated
with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers.
Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific
customer at the point the account is considered uncollectible. Accounts are
typically deemed uncollectible based on the sales channel, after becoming
either one hundred and twenty days or one hundred eighty days
overdue. We record the provision in marketing, general and administrative
expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or at the
point an account is written off.

We are not able to predict
changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related
to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade
receivables and trade loans could be materially affected.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method in Europe and
Canada and on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all
inventories in the United States. Current cost in the United States, determined
on the FIFO method, exceeded LIFO cost by $43.9 million and $42.3 million
at December 31, 2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively.

We regularly assess the
shelf-life of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes
apparent the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of
our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term
maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term obligations for
derivatives was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using market
interest rates. Assuming current market rates for similar instruments, the fair
value of long-term debt exceeds the carrying value by approximately $26.7
million and $53.6 million at December 31, 2006 and December 25,
2005, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities
recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the
respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the
balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange
rates during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process
are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income.

Factored Brands

In addition to supplying
our own brands, CBL sells other beverage companies’ products to on-premise
customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail
outlets. These factored brand sales are included in our financial results, but
the related volume is not included in our reported sales volumes. We refer to
this as the “factored brand business.” In the factored brand business, CBL
normally purchases factored brand inventory, taking orders from customers for
such brands, and invoicing customers for the product and related costs of
delivery. In accordance with EITF 99-19, “

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent

,”
sales under the factored brands are generally reported on a gross income basis.
However, CBL’s relationship with a large on-premise customer changed in 2005,
resulting in net reporting of sales and cost of sales as an agent for that
customer in our consolidated statement of operations on a prospective basis
from the date of change in our contract terms. The change in accounting
recognition from gross to net reporting reflects a change in the substance of
CBL’s status as transaction agent whereby there has been a transfer of credit
risk from CBL to the owner and supplier of the factored brands effective in
2005.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation

We evaluate the carrying
value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment
when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant
judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of goodwill and
intangible assets for impairment. See Note 12.


Statement of Cash Flows Data

Cash
equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of
90 days or less. The fair value of these investments approximates their
carrying value. The following presents our supplemental cash flow information:

Adoption of New
Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Interpretation
No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,” (“FIN 47”) which clarifies the
term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations.” (“SFAS 143”) Specifically, FIN 47 provides
that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and
(or) method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event.
Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value
of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the
liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and (or)
method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored
into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists.

We adopted FIN 47 on December 25, 2005, which
resulted in an increase to properties of $0.5 million, goodwill of $2.2
million, minority interest of $1.1 million, and liabilities of $9.6 million
related to asset retirement obligations. For asset retirement obligations
related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of Molson Inc. as of February 9,
2005, such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition
by $2.2 million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market
value at the acquisition date. These asset retirement obligations relate
primarily to clean-up, removal, or replacement activities and related costs for
asbestos, coolants, waste water, oils and other contaminants contained within
our manufacturing properties.

The adoption of FIN 47 was reflected in our financial
statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with
the catch-up adjustment of $3.7 million, net of tax benefit of $2.2 million, in
the 2005 statement of operations. This adjustment represents a depreciation
charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated,
which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related
long-lived assets, through December 25, 2005.


Inherent in the fair value
calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and
judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit
adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to
these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement
obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset
balance. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the
liability, we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. The net value
of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro-forma basis
as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to December 25, 2005
and December 26, 2004 were $9,628,580 and $5,926,852, respectively.

SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based Payment”

SFAS 123R was issued in December 2004 and
became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R requires
all share-based payments to qualified individuals, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized as compensation cost in the financial
statements based on their grant date fair values. Prior to the adoption, under
the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the
date of grant, we presented pro forma share-based compensation expense for our
stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We have elected
to use the modified prospective application method of implementing
SFAS 123R, which does not require restatement of prior periods. Under the
modified prospective application method, awards that are granted, modified, or
settled after adoption of SFAS 123R are prospectively measured and
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R. Unvested equity-classified
awards that were granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R will continue
to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123, except that the fair
value amounts are recognized in the statement of operations and are subject to
the forfeiture provisions of SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to assist preparers by
simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123R. In
particular, SAB 107 provides supplemental implementation guidance on
SFAS 123R, including guidance on valuation methods, classification of
compensation expense, inventory capitalization of share-based compensation
cost, income tax effects, disclosures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
and several other issues. We applied the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction
with our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006.

SFAS 123R requires a determination of excess tax
benefits available to absorb related share—based compensation. FASB Staff
Position 123R-3,

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

(FSP
123R-3), which was issued on November 10, 2005, provides a practical
transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based
payment awards to employees. Specifically, this FSP allows a company to elect
the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening balance. We have
adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance
of the excess tax benefits. This adoption did not have any impact on our
financial statements.

The effect of adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 was
an additional expense of $6.1 million pretax, $4.4 million after tax,
or $0.05 per diluted share. (See Note 14.)


The
following table illustrates the pro forma effects for the years ended December 25,
2005, and December 26, 2004, if the Company followed the fair value
provisions of SFAS 123R during such periods:

SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs”

SFAS 151 is an
amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that became effective for us in the
first quarter of 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage
requiring immediate recognition in the period they are incurred. The adoption
of this standard had no impact on our financial results.

SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Corrections”

SFAS 154 replaces APB
Opinion No. 20 and SFAS 3 and became effective for us in the first quarter
of 2006. The standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply
accounting principle changes to prior years’ comparative financial statements
as if the Company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle.
Changes in depreciation, amortization and depletion methods previously
considered a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in
estimate under SFAS 154, requiring prospective adoption. The adoption of
SFAS 154 did not have an impact on the financial statements included
herein.

FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FIN 45-3 “Application
of FASB Interpretation No. 45 to Minimum Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business
or its Owners”

FSP FIN 45-3 is an
amendment to FIN 45 requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value
of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a
business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period
of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. The FSP is effective for
new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified beginning in the first
quarter of 2006. We currently do not maintain arrangements with minimum revenue
guarantees that have a significant impact on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

SFAS 158 was issued in September 2006 and is
effective for our annual fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The
standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), requires an
employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension and/or
other postretirement


benefit plans as an asset
or liability in its statement of financial position. Funded status is the
difference between the projected benefit obligation and the market value of
plan assets for defined benefit pension plans, and is the difference between
the accumulated benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets (if any)
for other post retirement benefit plans. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to
recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 158,
liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
increased by $245 million and our accumulated other comprehensive income, net
of related deferred income taxes, decreased by approximately $172 million as of
December 31, 2006. A portion of the change in accumulated other
comprehensive income related to the adoption of SFAS 158 will be recognized in
the statement of operations as a component of net periodic pension benefit cost
in future periods. Such amount is estimated to be approximately $19.3 million
before tax, in 2007.  See Notes 16 and 17
for a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of SFAS 158.

In addition, this statement requires companies to
measure plan assets and obligations at the date of their year-end statement of
financial position, with limited exceptions. This measurement date provision
will be effective for our annual 2008 year end and will not have an impact on
the Company’s financial statements as we currently measure plan assets and
obligations as of our fiscal year-end.

The
impact of adopting SFAS 158 is displayed in the table below:

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 “Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements

)”

The SEC issued SAB 108 in September 2006
and it is effective for our fiscal 2006 year. SAB 108 requires companies to
evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial
statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover
approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach quantifies a
misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year
income statement. Thus, this approach ignores the effects of correcting the
portion of the current period balance sheet misstatement that originated in
prior periods. The iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the
effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end
of the current period, irrespective of the misstatement’s period(s) of
origin. Financial statements would be required to be adjusted when either
approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is


material.
Correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not
require previously filed reports to be amended. Our adoption of SAB 108 did not
impact the financial statements presented herein.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

SFAS No. 155 “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments”

SFAS 155 was issued
in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2007 fiscal year. Among other factors, SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting
for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting
for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation. We do not expect that SFAS 155 will
have an impact on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 156 “Accounting for Servicing of
Financial Assets—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140”

SFAS 156 was issued
in February 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2007 fiscal year. The new standard, which is an amendment to SFAS 140,
will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities by addressing
the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and
liabilities and providing an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like accounting.
We do not expect that SFAS 156 will have an impact on our financial
statements.

FASB’s Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 06-03
“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net
Presentation)”

In June 2006, the
FASB ratified a consensus on the EITF Issue No. 06-03 (EITF 06-03)
related to the classification of certain sales, value added and excise taxes
within the income statement. This EITF would become effective for us in the
first quarter of our fiscal year 2007. We are in the process of evaluating the
impact, if any, of this EITF on our presentation of such taxes on the statement
of operations.

FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “

Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

(FIN
48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process
to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax
position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be
sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not”
to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of
benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective as of
the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year.

We are continuing to
evaluate the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements.  While we have not concluded our analysis, we
anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will increase tax-related liabilities
(or decrease tax-related assets) by a minimum of $40 million and could increase
upon adoption. The cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be
reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption
(first reflected in the first quarter of 2007). We expect that the requirements
of FIN 48 may add volatility to our effective tax rate and therefore our
expected income tax expense in future periods.


SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”

SFAS 157 was issued
in September 2006 and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our
2008 fiscal year. This standard clarifies the definition of fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about
fair value measurements. We are still in the process of reviewing the impact,
if any, that SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

In February 2007, the
FASB issued Statement No. 159 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair
value. The objective of this Statement is to reduce both complexity in
accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement techniques.
The fair value measurement provisions are elective and can
be applied to individual financial instruments. SFAS 159
requires additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included
in the entity’s financial statements. This Statement is effective for us
as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We have not yet determined if
we will elect to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of this
Statement and what impacts such adoption might have on our financial
statements.

2.   Molson
Merger

Merger Transaction

On February 9, 2005, the Merger was effected
through an exchange of stock, in which Molson Inc. shareholders received stock
in MCBC according to an exchange ratio, depending upon the type of stock held. Also,
Molson Inc. shareholders were permitted to receive a combination of common
stock of MCBC and exchangeable shares in a subsidiary of MCBC, Molson Coors
Canada, Inc. Canadian resident holders who received exchangeable shares in
the Merger defer paying income taxes on the transaction until such time as they
exchange the shares for common stock or otherwise dispose of them.

In the Merger, Molson Inc. shareholders received the
following:

Molson Class A
Shareholders.

A holder
of Molson Class A non-voting shares who was a Canadian resident for
Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of
those shares:

·

0.360
of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Canada (and ancillary
rights),

·

through
a series of exchanges, 0.360 of a share of Class B common stock of MCBC,
or

·

a
combination of Class B exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and,
through a series of exchanges, shares of Class B common stock.

Molson Class B
Shareholders.

A holder
of Molson Class B common shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian
income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:

·

0.126
of a Class A exchangeable share and 0.234 of a Class B exchangeable
share of Molson Coors Canada (and ancillary rights),

·

through
a series of exchanges, an aggregate of 0.360 of a share of MCBC common stock,
comprised of 0.126 of a share of Class A common stock and 0.234 of a share
of Class B common stock, or

·

a combination of
exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges,
shares of MCBC common stock.


Molson Stock Option Holders

A holder of Molson Inc. stock options was permitted to
exchange each such Molson Inc. option for 0.360 of a MCBC option to purchase Class B
common stock. Approximately 1.3 million options were issued by MCBC in the
Merger.

Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common
shareholders, excluding Pentland Securities (a company controlled by Eric
Molson, a related party), also received a special dividend (the “Special
Dividend”) of CAD $5.44 per share, or a total of approximately CAD $652 million
(USD $523 million) paid by Molson in connection with the Merger to Molson Inc.
shareholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2005. Included
in the number of outstanding shares of Molson Inc.’s common stock were
approximately 1.4 million shares issued upon the exercise of options to
purchase Molson Class A common stock by Molson Inc.’s directors and senior
management between January 28, 2005, and February 8, 2005. This
resulted in an increase in the Special Dividend of CAD $12 million (USD $10
million) and an increase in Molson Inc.’s outstanding Class A common stock.
As discussed below, the Special Dividend was financed through additional debt.

At its January 28,
2005, meeting, in light of the amount of work involved in completing the Merger
transaction, the Board of Directors of Molson Inc. authorized additional
payments of: CAD $50,000 (USD $39,800) to each of the then outside directors of
Molson Inc.; an additional CAD $50,000 (USD $39,800) to the chairs of the
Independent Committee and Human Resources Committee; and CAD $845,000 (USD
$672,630) in aggregate additional payments to executive officers and certain
other employees of Molson Inc. All Merger-related expenses incurred by Molson
Inc. prior to the Merger were expensed as incurred.

Reasons for the Merger

The Merger placed our
combined Company as one of the largest brewers in the world, by volume, with
combined annual volume of approximately 40 million barrels. The combined
Company offers a diverse offering of owned and licensed brands in key markets
throughout the world.

Pro Forma Results

The results of Molson, Inc. have been included in
the consolidated financial statements since February 9, 2005.

The
following unaudited, pro forma information shows the results of our operations
for years ended December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, as if the
Merger had occurred at the beginning of the period. The pro forma results for
2005 include special charges of $169.3 million, consisting of post-Merger
charges and Merger-related charges incurred by Molson prior to February 9,
2005. Pro forma results for 2004 include special charges of $12.9 million,
including Merger-related Corporate expenses.

Allocation of Purchase Price

The Merger’s equity consideration was valued at
$3.6 billion, including the exchange of 46.7 million equivalent
shares of stock at a market price of $75.25 per share, the exchange of stock
options valued at $4.0 million, and Merger-related costs incurred by
Coors, of which $16.0 million was incurred prior to the Merger. Coors was
considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger, requiring the purchase
consideration to be allocated to Molson’s and Kaiser’s (now presented as discontinued
operations) assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, with the
residual to goodwill.

Synergies deriving from the Merger have benefited the
Canada and U.S. segments, and continue to do so. However, goodwill has been
allocated to the U.S. segment based upon projections that the largest portion
of synergy cost savings will benefit that segment. Fair value estimates of the
U.S. segment done both with and without total synergies expected to benefit the
U.S. segment indicate a difference in that fair value of $1.1 billion. Management
believes that this amount provides a reasonable basis for allocation of
goodwill to the U.S. segment

Intangible assets
associated with the Brazil segment on the opening balance sheet date are no
longer carried on our balance sheets as a result of the sale of our ownership
in Kaiser and were included in the calculation of the loss on the sale of that
business. See Note 4.

Merger-related debt

Subsequent to the Merger,
we established a $1.0 billion bridge facility which was used to refinance
pre-Merger Molson debt, including debt used to finance the Special Dividend and
to refinance some of Molson’s other pre-Merger debt. We also established a $1.4
billion, five-year credit facility which was used to refinance a portion of the
bridge facility borrowings. We had no borrowings and $163 million


outstanding
under the credit facility at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005,
respectively. Subsequent to establishing both of these facilities, the existing
bank facilities at both Molson and Coors were terminated. The bridge loan
facility was refinanced with proceeds from approximately $1.1 billion of senior
notes, which were issued on September 22, 2005.

Merger-related Other

Molson owns a 19.9% common
equity interest in the Montréal Canadiens professional hockey club (the Club). On
June 30, 2006, entities which control and own a majority of the Club
purchased the preferred equity held by Molson. Subsequent to the transaction,
Molson still retains a 19.9% common equity interest in the Club, as well as
Board representation on the Club and related entities. We account for our
interest in the Club using the equity method. See Note 6 for a discussion of
certain MCBC guarantee obligations associated with the investment in the Club.

3.   Segment
and Geographic Information

In 2005, we realigned our
reporting segments as a result of the Merger. Our reporting segments are driven
by geographic regions which is the basis on which our chief operating decision
maker evaluates the performance of the business. For comparative purposes, we
have also reclassified amounts in 2004 to reflect the new segment reporting
format. The Company operates in the reporting segments listed below. Our Brazil
segment, which was composed of Kaiser, was sold on January 13, 2006, and
is reflected as a discontinued operation.

Canada

The Canada segment consists of our production,
marketing and sales of the Molson and Coors Light brands, principally in
Canada; our joint venture arrangement related to the distribution and retail
sale of beer in Ontario, Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under
FIN 46R); and our joint venture arrangement (accounted as an equity investment)
related to the distribution of beer in the western provinces, Brewers’
Distributor Ltd. (BDL). The Canada segment also includes our equity interest in
the Montréal Canadiens Hockey Club.

We also distribute, market
and sell Corona Extra in Ontario, Québec, and the Atlantic provinces under an
agreement with Cerveceria Modelo S.A. de C.V. We have an agreement with
Heineken N.V. (Netherlands) that grants us the right to import, market and sell
Heineken products throughout Canada and with Miller to brew, market and sell
several Miller brands, and distribute and sell imported Miller brands. The Canada
segment also has an agreement with Carlton and United Breweries Limited, a
subsidiary of Foster’s Brewing Group Limited, to brew Foster’s Lager in Canada
for sale in Canada and the United States. Lastly, Molson has the right to
contract produce Asahi for the United States market.

United States (U.S.)

The U.S. segment consists
of the production, marketing, and sales of the Coors and Molson portfolios of
brands in the United States and its territories, its military bases world-wide,
Mexico and the Caribbean; Coors Distributing Company, which consists of
Company-owned beer distributorships in Colorado and Idaho; and Rocky Mountain
Metal Container (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC) joint ventures
consolidated under FIN 46R.

Europe

The Europe segment
consists of our production, marketing and sales of the CBL brands, principally
in the United Kingdom; our joint venture arrangement relating to the production
and distribution of Grolsch (consolidated under FIN 46R) in the United
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland; our joint venture


arrangement
for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam)
and sales of Molson Coors brands in Asia and other export markets.

Corporate

Corporate includes
interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not
allocated to any of the operating segments. The majority of these corporate
costs relates to worldwide administrative functions, such as corporate affairs,
legal, human resources, accounting, treasury, insurance and risk management. Corporate
also includes certain royalty income and administrative costs related to the
management of intellectual property.

Summarized financial information

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our
sales. Net sales represent sales to third party external customers. Inter-segment
sales revenues are insignificant and eliminated in consolidation.

The following tables
represent consolidated net sales, consolidated interest expense, consolidated
interest income and reconciliations of amounts shown as income (loss) from
continuing operations before income taxes and after pre-tax minority interests

4.   Discontinued
Operations

On January 13, 2006, we sold a 68% equity
interest in our Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (“Kaiser”), to
FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (“FEMSA”) for $68 million cash, less
$4.2 million of transaction costs, including the assumption by FEMSA of
Kaiser-related debt and certain contingencies. Kaiser represented our
previously-reported Brazil operating segment that we acquired on February 9,
2005 as part of the Merger. We retained a 15% interest in Kaiser throughout
most of 2006, which we accounted for under the cost method, and had one seat
out of seven on its board. Another brewer held a 17% equity interest in the
Kaiser business at the time of this transaction. As part of the sale, we also
received a put option to sell to FEMSA our remaining 15% interest in Kaiser for
the greater of $15.0 million or fair market value through January 2009
and at fair market value thereafter. The value of the put option favorably
impacted the calculation of the loss on the sale of Kaiser recorded in the
first quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we exercised the put
option on our remaining 15% interest which had a carrying value of $2 million
at the time of the sale, and received a cash payment of $15.7 million, including
$0.6 million of accrued interest, presented in our consolidated statement
of cash flows as an inflow from investing activities. As a result, we have no
ownership interest remaining in Kaiser as of December 31, 2006. We sold
Kaiser to allow us to focus on our Canada, United States and Europe markets.
Prior to the acquisition of 68% of Kaiser, FEMSA was, and remains, the largest
distributor of Kaiser products in Brazil. We have reflected the results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows for the former Brazil segment in
our financial statements as discontinued operations.

The terms of the sale agreement require us to
indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax, civil and labor contingencies
arising prior to FEMSA’s purchase of Kaiser (See Note 20). We provided a
full indemnity for any losses Kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims
associated with certain previously utilized tax credits. The total base amount
of potential claims in this regard, plus estimated accumulated penalties and
interest, was $247 million on the date of sale. As of December 31, 2006,
we have recorded the fair value of this indemnity liability on the balance
sheet at $77.7 million. Our indemnity obligations related to previously
purchased tax credits increased by $12.5 million during the fourth quarter as a
result of the exercise of the put option. We also provided indemnity related to
all other tax, civil and labor contingencies existing at the date of sale. In
this regard, however, FEMSA assumed its full share of all contingent
liabilities that had been previously recorded and disclosed by us up to a
maximum of $68 million. We may have to provide indemnity to FEMSA if those
contingencies settle at amounts greater than those amounts previously recorded
or disclosed by us. We will be able to offset any indemnity exposures in these
circumstances with amounts that settle favorably to amounts previously recorded.
As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded the fair value of this indemnity
liability at $33.3 million. Our indemnity obligations related to tax, civil and
labor claims increased by $5.5 million during the fourth quarter as a result of
the exercise of the put option. The recognition of and changes in the liabilities
associated with the indemnifications impacted the loss on the sale of Brazil
and future changes thereto will impact future reported results for discontinued
operations. See Note 20 for a more detailed discussion of these items as well
as a rollforward of the associated liabilities.

For the periods we had a controlling interest, Kaiser
had $57.8 million and $244.7 million of net sales and
$2.3 million and $100.5 million of pre-tax losses during the years
ended December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively. The 2006
period included the month of December 2005 and the first thirteen days of January 2006,
since we reported Kaiser’s results one month in arrears. The 2005 period
included the period between February 9, 2005 (the date of the Merger) and November 30,
2005, again due to our reporting Kaiser one month in arrears in 2005. The
accounting for our interest in Kaiser changed after the reduction in our
ownership in January 2006, resulting in accounting for our interest under
the cost method until the exercise of our put option of our remaining ownership
interest in the fourth quarter of 2006.


The table below summarizes
the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, presented on our
consolidated statements of operations:

The net loss resulted
from a gain of $13.6 million, representing the excess of proceeds over the
carrying value of the put option and a $18.0 million loss from the increase in
indemnity liabilities due to disposition of remaining ownership interest.

Included in current and
non-current assets of discontinued operations on the balance sheet are $4.6
million and $4.3 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets associated
with these indemnity liabilities. In addition to the indemnity liabilities
discussed above, current liabilities of discontinued operations include
deferred tax liabilities of $8.9 million.

5.   Variable
Interest Entities

FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities—An Interpretation of ARB51 (FIN 46R)

expands the scope of ARB51 and can require consolidation of “variable interest
entities (VIEs).” Once an entity is determined to be a VIE, the party with the
controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to
consolidate it. We have investments in VIEs, of which we are the primary
beneficiary. These include Brewers’ Retail Inc. (BRI) (effective with the
Merger on February 9, 2005), Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), Rocky
Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC), and Grolsch (U.K.) Limited (Grolsch). Accordingly,
we have consolidated these four joint ventures.

Brewers’ Retail Inc.

Brewers’ Retail Inc.
(BRI) is a joint venture beer distribution and retail network for the Ontario
region of Canada, owned by MCBC, Labatt and Sleeman brewers. Ownership
percentages fluctuate with sales volumes. At December 31, 2006, our
ownership percentage was approximately 52%. BRI operates on a breakeven basis.
The three owners guarantee BRI’s debt and pension liabilities, which were
approximately $184 million and $49 million, respectively, at December 31,
2006.

Rocky Mountain Metal Container

RMMC, a Colorado limited
liability company, is a joint venture with Ball Corporation in which we hold a
50% interest. We have a can and end supply agreement with RMMC. Under this
agreement, RMMC supplies us with substantially all the can and end requirements
for our Golden brewery. RMMC manufactures these cans and ends at our
manufacturing facilities, which RMMC is operating under a use and license
agreement. RMMC is a non-taxable entity. Accordingly, income tax expense on the
accompanying statements of operations only includes taxes related to our share
of the joint venture income or loss. The Company is the guarantor of
approximately $32 million and $36 million of RMMC debt at December 31, 2006,
and December 25, 2005, respectively.


Rocky Mountain Bottle Company

RMBC, a Colorado limited
liability company, is a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc.
(Owens) in which we hold a 50% interest. RMBC produces glass bottles at our glass
manufacturing facility for use at our Golden brewery. Under this agreement,
RMBC supplies our bottle requirements, and Owens has a contract to supply the
majority of our bottle requirements not met by RMBC. RMBC is a non-taxable
entity. Accordingly, income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations only includes taxes related to our share of the joint venture income
or loss.

Grolsch

Grolsch is a joint venture between CBL and Royal
Grolsch N.V. in which we hold a 49% interest. The Grolsch joint venture markets
Grolsch branded beer in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The
majority of the Grolsch branded beer is produced by CBL under a contract
brewing arrangement with the joint venture. CBL and Royal Grolsch N.V. sell
beer to the joint venture, which sells the beer back to CBL (for onward sale to
customers) for a price equal to what it paid, plus a marketing and overhead
charge and a profit margin. Grolsch is a taxable entity in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations
includes taxes related to the entire income of the joint venture.

The following summarizes
the assets and results of operations of our consolidated joint ventures
(including minority interests):

Trigen

In 1995, we sold a power
plant located at the Golden, Colorado brewery to Trigen-Nations Colorado
LLLP, including nearly all the fixed assets necessary to produce energy for the
brewery operations. All output from the power plant is sold to CBC at rates
consisting of fixed and variable components. We have no investment in Trigen
but, due to the nature of our relationship with Trigen, we believe we may have
a variable interest as defined by FIN 46R. We have no legal right or ability to
receive or review financial information for the activity that occurs at the
power plant. As a result, after exhaustive efforts, we were unable to conclude
as to whether the activity which occurs at the power plant is a variable
interest entity, and if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary as defined
by FIN 46R. We incurred net expenses of $41.3 million, $35.3 million and $30.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26,
2004, respectively, under our agreement with Trigen.

Montréal Canadiens Preferred Equity Holdings Sale

During the third quarter
of 2006, entities which control and own a majority of the Montréal Canadiens
hockey club (the Club) purchased the preferred equity holdings in the Club held
by Molson. In addition, Molson was released from a direct guarantee associated
with the Club’s debt financing and as a result our financial risk profile
improved. We have re-evaluated our risk related to all guarantees that the
Company continues to provide, specifically under the NHL Consent Agreement and
the Bell Centre land lease guarantees, which resulted in an approximate $9.0
million income benefit in the third quarter 2006 associated with the reduction
in the value attributable to such guarantee liabilities. Total proceeds
coincident with the sale of preferred equity holdings of the Club were CAD
$41.6 million (USD $36.5 million). The preferred equity holdings at
the time of sale had a carrying value of $35.6 million, excluding guarantees.
Molson continues to retain a 19.9% common equity interest in the Club as well
as Board representation. We will continue to apply the equity method of
accounting to our investment in the Club.

Sale of Real Estate to Cabela’s

On December 23, 2004, we sold 80 acres of land at
our Golden brewery site to Cabela’s, upon which they intend to build a retail
sporting goods store. A gain of $3.2 million is included in other income
in 2004. The contract also calls for Cabela’s to reimburse CBC for costs we
will incur to reclaim a former gravel pit.

In 2005, we recognized an
additional $2.1 million gain, before reclamation expense of approximately
$1.0 million, as we received reimbursement from Cabela’s for the amounts
exceeding the pre-existing reclamation liability. All reclamation activities at
this site have been completed.

South Table Mountain Land Sale

On December 12, 2004,
we sold real estate on South Table Mountain, adjacent to the Golden brewery, to
Jefferson County of Colorado. The property will be preserved as public open
space. We received $9.9 million in cash, and recorded an $8.2 million
gain that is included in other income for the year ended December 26,
2004.

Our full year effective tax rate was 17.5% in 2006 and
17.0% in 2005. Our 2006 effective tax rate was significantly lower than the
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following: lower income tax
rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses; and one time benefits
from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to
reductions in foreign income tax rates. Our 2005 effective tax rate was lower
than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower income tax rates
applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses and a one time benefit resulting
from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our
election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 25,
2005, as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 “

Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas

”(APB 23) and
SFAS 109 “

Accounting for Income Taxes

”(SFAS
109).

The Company has U.S. federal and state net operating
losses. The tax effect of these attributes is $2.7 million at December 31,
2006, and $2.6 million at December 25, 2005. The Company believes that a
portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to these loss carryforwards
will, more likely than not, not be realized and has established a valuation
allowance in the amount of $1.3 million and zero at December 31, 2006, and
December 25, 2005, respectively. The change in valuation allowance from December 25,
2005, to December 31, 2006, is attributable to anticipated changes in
state tax apportionment due to shutting down our Memphis brewing facility and
other changes in our U.S. operations. In addition, the Company has Canadian
federal and provincial net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. The
tax effect of these attributes is $25 million at December 31, 2006, and
$69.6 million at December 25, 2005. The Canadian capital loss
carryforwards do not have a limit in time to be used and the Canadian net
operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2013 through 2015. The Company
believes that a portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to the Canadian
loss carryforwards will, more likely than not, not be realized and has
established a valuation allowance in the amount of $5.3 million and $6.2
million at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively. In
addition, the Company has U.K. capital loss carryforwards. The tax effect of
these attributes was $12.2 million at December 31, 2006, and
$12.4 million at December 25, 2005. The U.K. capital loss
carryforwards do not have a limit in time to be used; however, the Company
believes that the deferred tax asset associated with these U.K. loss
carryforwards will, more likely than not, not be realized and has established a
valuation allowance for the full amount, $12.2 million and
$12.4 million at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005,
respectively. The change in amounts from December 25, 2005, to December 31,
2006, is attributable to changes in the foreign exchange rate.

Annual tax provisions include amounts considered
sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year
tax returns; however, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues may
differ materially from the amount accrued. See Note 1 for discussion regarding
future adoption of FIN 48.

We have elected to treat our portion of all foreign
subsidiary earnings through December 31, 2006 as permanently reinvested
under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109. As of December 31,
2006, approximately $1.0 billion of retained earnings attributable to
foreign subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely invested. The Company’s
intention is to reinvest the indefinitely invested earnings permanently or to
repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were
these earnings to be remitted. However, the Company believes that U.S. foreign
tax credits would largely eliminate any U.S. taxes and offset any foreign
withholding taxes due on remittance.

On February 21, 2007,
the Canadian government enacted a tax technical correction bill that will
result in an income tax benefit of approximately $90 million in the first
quarter of 2007. The tax technical correction bill allows the Company to
release a current tax liability that was established in Molson’s opening
balance sheet at the time of the Merger. The release of this tax liability
results in a one-time, non-cash income tax benefit to the income statement and
will be accounted for discretely in the first quarter of 2007.


8.   Special
Items, net

Largely in connection with
the Merger and our related synergy goals, we have incurred charges or gains
that are not indicative of our normal, recurring operations. As such, we have
separately classified these charges as special operating items.

table below details special items recorded in the previous three years, by

Canada Segment

The Canada segment restructured its sales and
marketing organizations in the fourth quarter of 2005, and recorded
$0.8 million of asset write-offs and lease exit costs, and
$4.4 million of severance and other exit costs. The restructuring efforts
impacted 46 employees.

U.S.
Segment

The
U.S. segment recognized $73.7 million and $68.1 million of net special items
in 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily in connection with the closure of our
Memphis facility. In 2006, $60.5 million of these items related to
accelerated depreciation and impairments of fixed assets, $3.1 million related
to our cost to withdraw from the Memphis hourly workers multi-employer pension
plan and the remaining $12.5 million included employee termination costs
and other incremental costs that were the direct result of the Memphis plant
closure. The Memphis plant was closed and sold during the third quarter of 2006
(see below). U.S. segment special items in 2006 were partially offset by the
benefit of a $2.4 million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of
a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations
at the Lowry Superfund site in Denver, Colorado. The cash received did not
impact our estimated environmental liability associated with this site.

In
2005, $36.5 million of these charges related to accelerated depreciation,
$25.0 million was expensed as the initial estimate of the cost required to
withdraw from the Memphis hourly workers multi-employer pension plan and the
remaining $6.6 million included employee termination costs and other
incremental costs that were the direct result of the Memphis plant closure.
Charges for accelerated depreciation are larger in 2006 than in 2005 due to
1) reductions in salvage value estimates of the Memphis brewery, and
2) acceleration of the plant’s closing date. Retention and severance costs
for the Memphis employees were expensed over the service period during which
such benefits were earned by the employees.

The liability for severance and other employee-related
costs includes a $27.6 million estimated payment required for our
withdrawal from the hourly workers multi-employer pension plan associated
with our Memphis location and is expected to be paid by September 2007. All
production from the Memphis location was relocated to a different Company-owned
facility or outsourced. The Memphis brewery was sold in September 2006 to
an investment group led by a former employee. The Memphis brewery assets were
depreciated to a value that approximated the sale price; therefore, the loss
from the final disposition of the assets and liabilities associated with
Memphis was insignificant. We entered into a distribution agreement with the
new Memphis brewery owners. Management believes that the terms of the sale of
the Memphis plant and the new three-year distribution agreement are market
reflective arms-length.

Europe
Segment

The
Europe segment recognized $9.0 million and $13.8 million of net
special items in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 net items comprised of
$13.0 million of employee termination costs associated with the U.K. supply
chain and back office restructuring efforts and $1.3 million of costs
associated with the exiting the Russia market, partially offset by a
$5.3 million pension curtailment gain. The pension curtailment resulted
from changes in the plan and reductions in headcount from restructuring efforts
and is discussed in Note 16. The 2005 special items reflect $14.3 million
of employee termination costs and asset impairment charges of $2.5 million,
partly offset by $3.0 million of income associated with long-lived assets,
consisting of gains on sales of assets and a one-time development profit on the
sale of real estate formerly held by the company.


The
supply chain and back office restructuring efforts impacted approximately 250
and 120 employees respectively. Pursuant to the restructuring plan, during the
year, 263 employees terminated employment under the plan. The remaining supply
chain terminations are expected through 2008. Charges for employee termination
costs have, in some cases, been recognized over the course of the employees’
remaining service period if there was a significant period of time between
initial notification and termination of employment.

Corporate
Costs

The
Corporate segment recognized a special benefit of $5.3 million and special
charges of $58.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The entire 2006
benefit was associated with the exercise price floor on stock options and
excise taxes to be paid for departed officers. The 2005 charges were associated
with 1) $31.8 million of severance and other benefits paid to twelve
former Coors officers who exercised change in control rights, 2) $6.9 million
were a result of providing an exercise price floor on stock options, including
additional payroll related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former Coors officer
that exercised stock options under the change in control agreement associated
with these potential awards, 3) $14.6 million of severance and share-based
compensation and benefits paid to two former Molson officers who left the
Company during the second quarter of 2005 following the Merger, and
4) $5.0 million of merger-related costs that did not qualify
for capitalization under purchase accounting.

Coors had agreements with executive officers, and
certain other members of management, relating to a change of control of Coors
(referred to above). The Merger, which occurred on February 9, 2005,
constituted a change in control of Coors under these agreements. These
employees were entitled to severance benefits if triggering events specified in
the agreement occurred. Upon a triggering event, the officer would receive a
multiple of annual salary and bonus and continued health, pension and life
insurance benefits. For terminated officers, stock option exercises are subject
to a floor market price equal to the price of Coors’ stock on the date of the
change of control ($73.50). This potential cash award is recorded as a
liability and is marked to market each period with the change in MCBC’s stock
price, up to the price at the date of the Merger and has a five year term from
February 2005 to February 2010. When the price of the Company’s stock
rises to the option floor, it results in a reduction of this liability. To the
extent the Company’s stock price falls below the Merger price, additional
charges are necessary. We recorded zero and $5.9 million liability as of
December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively, related to
stock option floor. The cost or benefit associated with the stock option
exercise price floor is included in the statement of cash flows as share-based
compensation as a non-cash increase or decrease to net income in
determining cash flows from operating activities.

Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2006
and December 25, 2005, 25 million shares of no par value preferred stock
were authorized but unissued.

Class A and Class B
Common Stock

Dividend Rights

Subject to the rights of
the holders of any series of preferred stock, stockholders of Molson Coors Class A
common stock (Class A common stock) are entitled to receive, from legally
available funds, dividends when and as declared by the board of directors of
Molson Coors, except that so long as any shares of Molson Coors Class B
common stock (Class B Common Stock) are outstanding, no dividend will be
declared or paid on the Class A common stock unless at the same time a
dividend in an amount per share (or number per share, in the case of a dividend
paid in the form of shares) equal to the dividend declared or paid on the Class A
common stock is declared or paid on the Class B common stock.

Voting Rights

Except in limited circumstances, including the right
of the holders of the Class B common stock and special Class B voting
stock voting together as a single class to elect three directors to the Molson
Coors board of directors, the right to vote for all purposes is vested
exclusively in the holders of the Class A common stock and special Class A
voting stock, voting together as a single class. The holders of Class A
common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, without the right to
cumulate votes for the election of directors.

An affirmative vote
is required of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of
the Class A common stock and special Class A voting stock (through
which holders of Class A exchangeable shares vote), voting together as a
single class, prior to the taking of certain actions, including:

·

the
issuance of any shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible
into Class A common stock (other than upon the conversion of Class B
common stock under circumstances provided in the certificate of incorporation
or the exchange or redemption of Class A exchangeable shares in accordance
with the terms of those exchangeable shares) or securities (other than Class B
common stock) convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock;


·

the
issuance of shares of Class B common stock (other than upon the conversion
of Class A common stock under circumstances provided in the certificate of
incorporation or the exchange or redemption of Class B exchangeable shares
in accordance with the terms of those exchangeable shares) or securities (other
than Class A common stock) that are convertible into or exercisable for Class B
common stock, if the number of shares to be issued is equal to or greater than
20% of the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock;

·

the
issuance of any preferred stock having voting rights other than those expressly
required by Delaware law;

·

the
sale, transfer or other disposition of any capital stock (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock) of subsidiaries;

·

the
sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company; and

·

any
decrease in the number of members of the Molson Coors board of directors to a
number below 15.

Pentland and the Coors Trust, which together control
more than two-thirds of the Company’s Class A Common and Exchangeable
stock, have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their
voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A
exchangeable shares that they own. However, in the event that these two
stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder
vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be
required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A
exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is
no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential
deadlock between these stockholders.

The Molson Coors
certificate of incorporation provides the holders of Class B common stock
and special Class B voting stock (through which holders of Class B
exchangeable shares vote), voting together as a single class, the right to
elect three directors to the Molson Coors board of directors. In addition, the
holders of Class B common stock and special Class B voting stock,
voting together as a single class, have the right to vote on specified
transactional actions. Except in the limited circumstances provided in the
certificate of incorporation, the right to vote for all other purposes is
vested exclusively in the holders of the Class A common stock and special Class A
voting stock, voting together as a single class. The holders of Class B
common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held with respect to each
matter on which holders of the Class B common stock are entitled to vote,
without the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors.

Rights Upon
Dissolution or Wind Up

If Molson Coors
liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs, the holders of Class A
common stock, together with the holders of the Class B common stock, would
be entitled to receive, after Molson Coors’ creditors have been paid and the
holders of any then outstanding series of preferred stock have received their
liquidation preferences, all of the remaining assets of Molson Coors in
proportion to their share holdings. Holders of Class A and Class B
common stock would not have pre-emptive rights to acquire any securities of
Molson Coors. The outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common
stock would be fully paid and non-assessable.

Conversion Rights

The Molson Coors
certificate of incorporation provides for the right of holders of Class A
common stock to convert their stock into Class B common stock on a
one-for-one basis at any time.


Exchangeable Shares

The Class A exchangeable shares and Class B
exchangeable shares were issued by Molson Coors Canada Inc. (MCCI) a
wholly-owned subsidiary. The exchangeable shares are substantially the economic
equivalent of the corresponding shares of Class A and Class B common
stock that a Molson shareholder in the Merger would have received if the holder
had elected to receive shares of Molson Coors common stock. Holders of
exchangeable shares also receive, through a voting trust, the benefit of Molson
Coors voting rights, entitling the holder to one vote on the same basis and in
the same circumstances as one corresponding share of Molson Coors common stock.

The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at any time,
at the option of the holder on a one-for-one basis for corresponding shares of
Molson Coors common stock.

Holders of
exchangeable shares are entitled to receive, subject to applicable law,
dividends as follows:

·

in
the case of a cash dividend declared on a corresponding share of Molson Coors
common stock, an amount in cash for each exchangeable share corresponding to
the cash dividend declared on each corresponding share of Molson Coors common
stock in USD or in an equivalent amount in CAD;

·

in
the case of a stock dividend declared on a corresponding share of Molson Coors
common stock to be paid in shares of Molson Coors common stock, in the number
of exchangeable shares of the relevant class for each exchangeable share that
is equal to the number of shares of corresponding Molson Coors common stock to
be paid on each corresponding share of Molson Coors common stock; or

·

in
the case of a dividend declared on a corresponding share of Molson Coors common
stock in any other type of property, in the type and amount of property as is
economically equivalent as determined by MCCI’s board of directors to the type
and amount of property to be paid on each corresponding share of Molson Coors
common stock.

The declaration dates,
record dates and payment dates for dividends on the exchangeable shares are the
same as the relevant dates for the dividends on the shares of corresponding
Molson Coors common stock.

Our calculation of weighted average shares includes
all four classes of our outstanding stock: Class A and Class B
Common, and Class A and Class B Exchangeable. Exchangeable shares are
the equivalent of common shares, by class, in all respects.

All classes of stock have in effect
the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. Class A
shareholders receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and
paid to Class B shareholders. See Note 9 for further discussion of the
features of Class A and B Common shares and Class A and B
Exchangeable shares.

Anti-dilutive securities totaling 4.1 million,
4.0 million and 1.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were not
included in our calculation due to the fact that the stock options’ exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares or were
anti-dilutive due to the impact of unrecognized compensation cost on the
calculation of assumed proceeds in the application of the treasury stock method.
The assumed proceeds calculation in the treasury stock method required us to
determine windfall tax benefits. We calculated this amount by multiplying
in-the-money options outstanding by a dollar amount derived by calculating the
current average market price less the grant price less the Black-Scholes
fair value amount. This product was multiplied by the appropriate tax rate.

Outstanding performance
stock awards, totaling 1,030,338 on December 31, 2006, were also excluded
from dilutive shares in accordance with SFAS 128,

“Earnings per Share.”

, as all necessary
conditions required to be satisfied (outlined in Note 14) had not been met
as of the year ended December 31, 2006. There were no performance awards
issued or outstanding prior to 2006.

Land, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated
at cost. Depreciation is calculated principally on the straight-line method
over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements, 10 to
40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 20 years; furniture and
fixtures, 3 to 10 years.

Depreciation expense was $363.0 million,
$326.4 million and $240.8 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Certain equipment held under capital lease is classified as
equipment and amortized using the straight-line method or estimated useful
life, whichever is shorter over the lease term. Lease amortization is included
in depreciation expense. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that
substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Start-up costs associated with manufacturing facilities, but not related to
construction, are expensed as incurred. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

We capitalize certain software development costs that
meet established criteria, in accordance with Statement of Position, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Systems Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

,” (SOP 98-1). Capitalized software development
costs are presented in machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures and
construction in progress. We amortize software costs over 3-5 years. Software
development costs not meeting the criteria in SOP 98-1, including system
reengineering, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software added in 2006 and
2005 was insignificant.

CBL owns and maintains the
dispensing equipment in on-premise retail outlets. Dispensing equipment
that moves the beer from the keg in the cellar to the glass is capitalized at
cost upon installation and depreciated on a straight-line basis over
lives of up to 7 years, depending on the nature and usage of the equipment.
Labor and materials used to install dispensing equipment are capitalized and
depreciated over 2 years. Dispensing equipment awaiting installation is
held in inventory and valued at the lower of cost or market. Ordinary repairs
and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Certain distribution rights intangibles subject to
amortization are based upon licensing agreements with other brewers for the
production and/or distribution of their products. We received notification from
the Foster’s Group (Foster’s) during the fourth quarter 2006 that they intend
to terminate our U.S. production agreement in this respect, effective in the
fourth quarter of 2007. A termination of this contract could result in an
impairment of a significant portion of our distribution right intangible
associated with the Foster’s business, which has a carrying value of
approximately $25 million at December 31, 2006. We contend that
termination notice is ineffective. Miller Brewing Company (Miller) has sued us
to invalidate our brewing and distribution license agreement. We are contesting
their claim, and currently are in discussions with Miller regarding a
resolution of this dispute, However, there can be no assurances that we will
arrive at such a resolution. A termination or renegotiation of this agreement
could result in an impairment of our distribution right intangible associated
with the Miller brand, which has a carrying value of $112.0 million at
December 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we renegotiated the
terms of licensing agreements with the owners of the Corona and Heineken brands
for the Canada market.

As discussed in Note 2, we allocated
$1.8 billion to goodwill as a result of the Merger. Of that amount,
$1.1 billion has been allocated to the U.S. segment based upon projections
that a large portion of synergy cost savings will benefit that business unit
with the remainder included in the Canada segment. In addition,
$159.3 million of goodwill associated with the 2002 acquisition of CBL has
been allocated to the U.S. segment, also based on expected synergy savings at
the time of the acquisition.

SFAS 142 stipulates
that we are required to perform goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset
impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain
circumstances. We completed the required impairment testing of goodwill and
other intangible assets under SFAS 142 during the third quarter of 2006
and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangible assets.

On May 7, 2002 Coors
Brewing Company (CBC) completed a private placement of $850 million principal
amount of 6


/


% senior notes, due 2012, with
interest payable semi-annually.  The
notes are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund provision and include
a redemption provision (make-whole provision) if the notes are retired before
their scheduled maturity.  The redemption
price is equal to the greater of

(1)

100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and

(2)

the make-whole amount of
the notes being redeemed, which is equal to the present value of the principal
amount of the notes and interest to be redeemed.  Net proceeds from the sale of the notes,
after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting fees, were approximately
$841 million.  The notes were
subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes with the same terms.  The notes are guaranteed by Molson Coors
Brewing Company, all of its significant U.S. subsidiaries and Molson


Coors Capital Finance
ULC.  The securities have certain
restrictions on

secured borrowing, sale-leaseback
transactions and the sale of assets, all of which the Company was in compliance
with at December 31, 2006.

(3)

On September 22, 2005,
Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC (MCCF), a Nova Scotia entity and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company issued 10-year and 5-year private placement debt
securities totaling CAD $900 million in Canada and USD $300 million in the
United States.  The Canadian bonds bear
interest at 5.0% and the U.S. bonds bear interest at 4.85%.  Both offerings are guaranteed by Molson Coors
Brewing Company and all of its significant U.S. subsidiaries.  The securities have certain restrictions on
secured borrowing, sale-leaseback transactions and the sale of assets, all of
which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2006.  The securities pay interest semi-annually on
March 22 and September 22.  The private
placement securities will mature on September 22, 2010 for the U.S. issue and
September 22, 2015 for the Canadian issue. 
All the proceeds from these transactions were used to repay outstanding
amounts on the Company's $1.3 billion bridge facility that was outstanding at
the time of issuance, a facility which was terminated at the time of
repayment.  Debt issuance costs
capitalized in connection with the debt issuances will be amortized over the
life of the bonds and total approximately $9.2 million.  The notes were subsequently exchanged for
publicly registered notes with the same terms.

(4)

We maintain a $500
million commercial paper program and as of December 31, 2006 there were no
outstanding borrowings under this program. 
As of December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings on our
total $750 million unsecured committed credit arrangement.  The facility is used as a backstop for our
commercial paper program [see

(5)

below].  This line of credit has a five-year term
expiring 2011.

(5)

In March 2005, we
entered into a $1.4 billion revolving multicurrency bank credit facility.  Amounts drawn against the credit facility
accrue interest at variable rates, which are based upon LIBOR or CDOR, plus a
spread based upon Molson Coors' long-term bond rating and facility
utilization.  In August 2006, the amount
of the credit line was reduced to $750 million and the expiration date was
extended to August 2011.  At December 31,
2006, there were no borrowings outstanding against the facility.

14.   Share-Based Payments—Stock Option,
Restricted Stock and Other Stock Awards

In the first quarter of
2006, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123,
“Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R). The Company adopted
SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption, which does
not require restatement of prior periods.

SFAS 123R requires a
determination of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share—based
compensation. FASB Staff Position 123R-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards

(FSP 123R-3), which was issued on November 10,
2005, provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the
tax effects of share-based payment awards to employees. Specifically, this FSP
allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the
opening excess tax benefits balance. We have adopted such alternative method
provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the excess tax benefit in the
financial statements ended December 31, 2006. Under the new standard,
excess income tax benefits, if any, from share-based compensation are
presented as financing activities rather than operating activities in the
statements of cash flows. This adoption did not have any impact on our
financial statements.

At December 31, 2006,
we had three stock-based compensation plans.

The 1990 Equity Incentive Plan

The 1990 Equity Incentive
Plan (EI Plan) generally provides for two types of grants: stock options and
restricted stock awards for our employees. The stock options have a term of 10
years and one-third of the stock option vests in each of the three successive
years after the date of grant. There were no awards granted under the Company’s
EI Plan in 2006, and we are not expecting to grant any new awards under this
plan.


Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors

The Equity Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (EC Plan) provides for awards of the Company’s Class B
shares of restricted stock or options for Class B shares. Awards vest
after completion of the director’s annual term. The compensation cost
associated with the EC plan is amortized over the directors’ term. There were
no awards granted under the Company’s EC Plan in 2006, and we are not expecting
to grant any new awards under this plan.

Molson Coors Brewing Company Incentive Compensation
Plan

During 2006, we issued the
following awards related to Class B common shares to certain directors,
officers, and other eligible employees, pursuant to the Molson Coors Brewing
Company Incentive Compensation Plan (MCBC IC Plan): stock options, restricted
stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares, and limited stock
appreciation rights.

Stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of common stock on
the date of grant. Stock options have a term of 10 years and generally
vest over three years.

Restricted stock unit
awards are issued at the market value equal to the price of our stock at the
date of the grant and vest over the period of three years. In 2006, we granted
182,110 of restricted stock units with the weighted-average market value
of $68.69 each.

Deferred stock units
awards, under the Directors’ Stock Plan pursuant to the MCBC IC Plan, are
elected by the non-employee directors of Molson Coors Brewing Company by
enabling them to receive all or one-half of their annual cash retainer payments
in our stock. The deferred stock unit awards are issued at the market value
equal to the average day’s price on the date of the grant and generally vest
over the annual service period. We granted 2,981 deferred stock units with the
weighted—average market value of $72.40 each.

Performance share awards
are earned over the estimated expected term to achieve projected financial
targets established at the time of the grant. Currently, these financial
targets are expected to be achieved by the end of our fiscal year 2009 at which
point these shares will fully vest. This estimate is subject to future
revisions based on the performance levels of the Company. Performance shares
are granted at the market value of our stock at the date of the grant and have
a term of five years. In 2006, 1,073,838 shares were granted under this plan at
the weighted-average market value of $69.10 per share.

On March 21, 2006,
the Company issued 150,000 limited stock appreciation rights to one of its key
executives. These limited stock appreciation rights entitle the executive to
receive shares of the Company’s stock with a fair market value equal to the
excess of the trading price of such shares on the date of the exercise, but not
to exceed $77.20, and the trading price on the date of the grant, or $70.01 per
share. The award cannot be exercised before May 2, 2007, and will fully
vest on May 2, 2008. The fair value of this award of $2.15 per limited
stock appreciation right as of the date of grant was determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The total fair value of $0.3 million, at March 21,
2006, will be recognized in the statement of operations on a straight-line
basis over 2.1 years, the remaining $0.2 million will vest in approximately
1.3 years. The option pricing model includes certain assumptions and
estimates. For the assumptions and estimates management used for this award,
see the table in the stock option section below.

As of December 31,
2006, there were 1,631,975 shares of the Company’s stock available for the
issuance of the stock options, restricted stock units, director stock units,
performance shares, and limited stock appreciation rights awards under the
Molson Coors Brewing Company Incentive Compensation Plan.

Included in the pre-tax stock option compensation
expense is the mark-to-market stock option floor adjustment of
$5.8 million benefit and the $5.9 million charge for the years ended December 31,
2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively. The stock option floor
adjustment was included in special charges in the statements of operations.
Included in the restricted stock compensation expense was the deferred stock
unit amortization of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.

The fair value of each
option granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was determined on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The risk-free interest rates utilized for periods
throughout the contractual life of the options are based on a zero-coupon U.S.
Treasury security yield at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on
historical volatility of our stock. We use historical data to estimate option
expected term. The range of 3.5 years to 7.0 years results from
separate groups of employees who exhibit different historical exercise
behavior.

16.   Employee
Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company offers retirement plans in Canada, the
United States and the United Kingdom that cover substantially all its
employees. Benefits for all employees are generally based on salary
and years of service. Plan funding strategies are influenced by employee
benefits laws and tax laws. The Company’s U.K. plan includes provision for
employee contributions and inflation-based benefit increases for
retirees. The U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to new employees in April 2006.

As a result of the Merger, the Company added pension
liabilities of approximately $260.0 million, which represented the under
accrued position of the Canadian plans on February 9, 2005, including


obligations existing at
BRI. The Company incurred approximately $7.7 million of additional pension
expense related to severance and change in control benefits to departing
executives in the first half of 2005 which are included in Special items, net
(see Note 8).

We adopted SFAS 158 for our annual fiscal 2006
year ending December 31, 2006. The standard, which is an amendment to SFAS
87, 88, 106, and 132(R), requires an employer to recognize the funded status of
any defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans as an asset
or liability in its statement of financial position. The incremental impact of
adopting SFAS 158 on individual line items of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of December 31, 2006 is shown in Note 1. The additional disclosures
required by SFAS 158 are included in this footnote.

Total defined benefit pension plan expense was $32.8
million, $64.8 million and $43.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The aggregate funded position of the Company’s plans resulted in
the recognition of an additional minimum liability in 2005 and 2004.

Canada, U.S. and U.K. plan assets consist of equity
securities with smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. Equity assets are
well diversified between international and domestic investments, with
additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to
large-cap, small-cap, and growth and value investments. Relative allocations
reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants.

The
following compares target asset allocation percentages with actual asset
allocations at December 31, 2006:

Investment return assumptions for all plans have been
determined by applying the returns to assets on a weighted average basis and
adding an active management premium where appropriate.

It is expected that contributions to the Canada, U.S.
and U.K. plans during 2007 will be approximately $185 million collectively
(including supplemental executive plans).

U.K. Plan
Curtailment

As a result of employee restructuring activities
associated with the Europe segment supply chain operations, a pension
curtailment was recognized in the second quarter of 2006. The curtailment
triggered a significant event that resulted in the re-measurement of the
pension assets and liabilities as of April 30, 2006. The table below
represents the projected benefit obligation and the funded status as of December 31,
2006, the curtailment measurement date of April 30, 2006, and the changes
in their status from December 25, 2005, for the U.K. plan.

As a result of the curtailment, a gain of
$5.3 million was recognized and presented as a special item in the
statement of operations in the second quarter of 2006. This gain arose from the
reduction in estimated future working lifetimes of plan participants resulting
in the acceleration of the recognition of a prior service benefit. This prior
service benefit was generated by plan changes in previous years and was
deferred on the balance sheet and amortized into earnings over the
then-expected working lifetime of plan participants of approximately
10 years.

In addition, this curtailment event required a
remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, which
resulted in an $11.8 million reduction in the projected benefit obligation
at April 30, 2006, as shown below, which was recognized in other
comprehensive income in 2006.

Multiemployer Plan

Certain of our former
employees in Memphis participated in a multi-employer union retirement
plan, into which we made contributions on their behalf. Contributions totaled
$1.2 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. In 2005, we announced our intention to close the


Memphis
facility. As a result, we recorded a $25 million liability in 2005, which
was our estimated payment due to the union upon withdrawal from the pension
plan. An additional $3.1 million was recorded in 2006 for this liability. The
liability is expected to be paid by September 2007.

Defined Contribution Plan

U.S. employees
are eligible to participate in the Coors Savings and Investment Plan, a
qualified voluntary defined contribution plan. We match 50% of our hourly and
salaried non-exempt and 75% of our salaried exempt employees’
contributions up to 6% of employee compensation. Both employee and employer
contributions are made in cash in accordance with participant investment
elections. There are no minimum amounts that are required to be invested in CBC
stock. Our contributions in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $7.8 million,
$8.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively.

From April 2006, new
employees of the U.K. business were not entitled to join the Company’s defined
benefit pension plan. These employees are instead given an opportunity to
participate in a defined contribution plan. Under this plan the Company will
match employee contributions up to a maximum of 7% of the employee’s
compensation. Company contributions to this plan in 2006 were approximately
$0.02 million.

17.   Postretirement
Benefits

CBC and Molson have postretirement plans that provide
medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The
plans are not funded.

We adopted SFAS 158 for our annual fiscal 2006
year ending December 31, 2006. The standard, which is an amendment to SFAS
87, 88, 106, and 132(R), requires an employer to recognize the funded status of
any defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial position. The incremental
impact of adopting SFAS 158 on individual line items of the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 is shown in Note 1. The additional
disclosures required by SFAS 158 are included in this footnote.

The obligations under
these plans were determined by the application of the terms of medical and life
insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care
cost trend rates detailed in the table below.

18.   Derivative
Instruments

Market Risk Management Policies

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates, the value of foreign currencies and production
and packaging materials prices. We have established policies and procedures
that govern the strategic management of these exposures through the use of a
variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into such
contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation.

Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging
materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows
affected by changes in the underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective,
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest
rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite
direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net
investments in foreign-currency-denominated operations or
translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency
exposures are the Canadian dollar (CAD), the British Pound Sterling (GBP or £),
and the Japanese yen (JPY).


Derivatives are either
exchange-traded instruments or over-the-counter agreements entered into
with highly rated financial institutions. We are exposed to credit-related
losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments
and do not enter into master netting arrangements. The counterparties to
derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade
credit ratings of at least A (Standard & Poor’s), A2 (Moody’s) or
better. However, this does not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these
institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in
such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as
contracted. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit
guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to
prescribed guidelines. We utilize a portfolio of financial institutions either
headquartered or operating in the same countries we conduct our business. As a
result of the above considerations, we consider the risk of counterparty
default to be minimal. In some instances our counterparties and we have
reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in
excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of
collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a
fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount.
At December 31, 2006, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or
us.

Derivative Accounting Policies

The majority of all derivatives entered into by the
Company qualify for, and are designated as, foreign-currency cash flow
hedges, commodity cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, including those
derivatives hedging foreign currency denominated firm commitments as per the
definitions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB
Statements No. 137, 138 and 149” (SFAS No. 133).

The Company considers whether any provisions in
non-derivative contracts represent “embedded” derivative instruments as
described in SFAS No. 133. As of December 31, 2006, we have concluded
that no “embedded” derivative instruments warrant separate fair value
accounting under SFAS No. 133.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at
their fair value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current
assets or other non-current assets. Unrealized loss positions are recorded as
other liabilities or other non-current liabilities. Changes in unrealized gains
and losses from fair value hedges are classified in the statement of operations
consistent with the classification of the corresponding income or expense line
item being hedged. Changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedges that
are highly effective as per the definition of SFAS 133 are recorded in
other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of
cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction. In most cases amounts recorded
in other comprehensive income will be released to earnings at maturity of the
related derivative. The recognition of effective hedge results in the
consolidated statement of income offsets the gains or losses on the underlying
exposure. Cash flows from derivative transactions are classified according to
the nature of the risk being hedged.

We formally document all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all
derivatives either to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or
specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess,
both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be
expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined
that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, we
discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.

We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the
derivative is no longer highly effective, as per SFAS No. 133, in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm
commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or


exercised; (3) it is
no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management
determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer
appropriate.

When we discontinue hedge accounting but it continues
to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally
expected period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated
other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is no longer probable
that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified
time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the
gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be
recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting
is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet until maturity, recognizing
future changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. Any hedge
ineffectiveness, as per SFAS No. 133, is recorded in current-period
earnings in other expense (income), net. Effectiveness is assessed based on the
comparison of current forward rates to the rates established on our hedges.

are the notional transaction amounts and fair values for our outstanding
derivatives, summarized by risk category and instrument type.

comprehensive income in shareholders equity as of December 31, 2006,
December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004. Gains and losses deferred as
of December 31, 2006 are generally expected to be recognized as the
underlying transactions occur. The amounts ultimately recognized may differ,
favorably or unfavorably, from those shown due to the fact that some of our
derivative positions are not yet settled and therefore remain subject to
ongoing market price fluctuations. As noted, effective gains and losses are
deferred over time and recognized simultaneously with the impact of the
underlying transactions. The ineffective gains and losses are recognized
immediately when it was evident they did not precisely offset changes in the
underlying transaction.

Significant Hedged Positions

Upon the Merger and in connection with our debt
offerings (Note 13), we added various derivative instruments held by
Molson that hedged currency, commodity and interest rate risk in a similar
manner as Coors.

We are a party to a cross currency swap totaling CAD
$30 million (approximately USD $25.7 million at prevailing foreign
currency exchange rates in 2006). The swap included an initial exchange of
principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap also calls for an exchange of fixed
CAD interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At the initial principal
exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received CAD. Upon final exchange,
we will provide CAD to the counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency
swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the
future CAD interest and principal receipts that result from changes in the USD
to CAD exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. In
addition, in September of 2006 we entered into a cross currency swap
totaling GBP £24.4 million (approximately USD $47.8 million at prevailing
foreign currency exchange rates in 2006). The swap included an initial exchange
of principal in 2005 and matures in 2006. The swap calls for an exchange of
fixed GBP interest payments for fixed CAD interest receipts. At the initial
principal exchange, we paid CAD to a counterparty and received GBP. The cross
currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value
of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that result from changes in
the CAD to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our
subsidiaries.

Prior to issuing the notes on September 22, 2005
(See Note 13), we entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of
the Canadian offering. The bond forward transaction effectively established, in
advance, the yield of the government of Canada bond rates over which the
Company’s private placement was priced. At the time of the private placement
offering and pricing, the government of Canada bond rate was trading at a yield
lower than that locked in with the Company’s interest rate lock. This resulted
in a loss of $4.0 million on the bond forward transaction. Per
FAS 133 accounting, the loss will be amortized over the life of the
Canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the Company’s
effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points compared to the stated coupon
on the issue.

Simultaneously with the September 22, 2005, U.S.
private placement (See Note 13), we entered into a cross currency swap
transaction for the entire USD $300 million issue amount and for the same
maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our USD $300 million for a CAD
$355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms of the transaction
are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of 4.28% to the third
party on the amount of CAD $355.5 million and will receive interest at a
rate of 4.85% on the USD $300 million amount. There was an exchange of
principal at the inception of this transaction, and there will be a subsequent
exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated
this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated
with the payment of interest and principal on the USD securities. Consistent
with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due
to foreign exchange will be recorded in earnings and will be offset by a
revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the value of the
transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive
income.

As of December 31, 2006, we are a party to other
cross currency swaps totaling GBP £530 million (approximately USD
$774 million at the date of entering the transaction). The swaps included
an initial exchange of principal on the settlement date of our 6


¤


% private placement fixed rate
debt (see Note 13) and will require final principal exchange in May 2012.
The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed
USD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a
counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the
counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency swaps have been designated as
cash flow hedges of the changes in value


of the future GBP interest
and principal receipts that results from changes in the USD to GBP exchange
rates on an intercompany loan between our Europe subsidiary and U.S.
subsidiary.

We entered into interest rate swap agreements related
to our 6


¤


% fixed rate debt. These
interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million notional amount from fixed
rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will receive fixed USD interest
payments semi-annually at a rate of 6


¤


% per annum and pay a rate to
our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three-month LIBOR
rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating interest
rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the
swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the
changes in the fair value of the $201.2 million fixed rate debt
attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates.

The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate
swaps, converting CAD $100.0 million notional amount of the CAD $200 million
7.5% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert the CAD $100.0 million to
floating rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the
inception of the swaps. During July 2006, we entered into and designated
the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value
of the CAD $100.0 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the
LIBOR swap rates. Prior to the inception of this fair value hedge, the interest
rate swaps held by BRI were the only Molson Inc. derivative instruments
that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Mark-to-market
changes on these interest rate swaps were recorded as interest expense.

Our fair value hedges effective losses (gains), net
were $2.2 million, $7.4 million and $(2.6) million for the years ended December 31,
2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively.

As of December 31,
2006, $7.2 million of deferred gains on both outstanding and matured
derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be
reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as a result of
expected gains or losses on underlying hedged transactions also being recorded
in earnings. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings are dependent
on the applicable rates in effect when derivatives contracts that are currently
outstanding mature. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum term over which
we are hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for all forecasted
and recorded transactions is 10 years.

and Contingencies

Letters of Credit

As of December 31,
2006, we had approximately $55.4 million outstanding in letters of credit with
financial institutions. These letters expire at different points in 2007 and
2008. Approximately $22.6 million of the letters contain a feature that
automatically renews the letter for an additional year if no cancellation


notice
is submitted. These letters of credit are being maintained as security for
deferred compensation payments, reimbursements to insurance companies,
reimbursements to the trustee for pension payments, deductibles or retention
payments made on our behalf, various payments due to governmental agencies, and
for operations of underground storage tanks.

Power Supplies

In 1995, Coors Energy
Company (CEC), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a power plant located at the
Golden brewery location to Trigen-Nations Energy Company, LLLP (Trigen).
We have an agreement to purchase substantially all of the electricity and steam
produced by Trigen and needed to operate the brewery’s Golden facilities
through 2020. Our financial commitment under this agreement is divided between
a fixed, non-cancelable cost, which adjusts annually for inflation, and a
variable cost, which is generally based on fuel cost and our electricity and
steam use. Total purchases, fixed and variable, under this contract in 2006,
2005 and 2004 were $43.7 million, $37.7 million and
$33.2 million, respectively.

Supply Contracts

We have various long-term
supply contracts with unaffiliated third parties and our joint venture partners
to purchase materials used in production and packaging, such as starch, cans
and glass. The supply contracts provide that we purchase certain minimum levels
of materials throughout the terms of the contracts. The approximate future
purchase commitments will be met under these supply contracts and total:

for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005, and
December 26, 2004, respectively.

Graphic Packaging
Corporation

We have a packaging supply
agreement with a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Corporation, a related party,
under which we purchase our U.S. segment paperboard requirements. Our payments
under the packaging agreement in 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled approximately
$74.0 million, $75.3 million, and $104.5 million, respectively.
We expect payments in 2007 to be approximately the same as 2006. Related
accounts payable balances included in Affiliates accounts payable on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $0.8 million and $2.8 million as of December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005, respectively.

Advertising and
Promotions

We have various long-term
non-cancelable commitments for advertising, sponsorships and promotions,
including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events.
From time to time, MCBC guarantees the financial performance under certain
contracts on behalf of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, these

Environmental

When we determine that it is probable that a liability
for environmental matters or other legal actions exists and the amount of the
loss is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the future costs are recorded as a
liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life, increase the
capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of Company-owned assets or
are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be
capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred.

From time to time, we have been notified that we are
or may be a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws
for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been
released into the environment. We cannot predict with certainty the total costs
of cleanup, our share of the total cost, the extent to which contributions will
be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the
cleanups or insurance coverage.

We are one of a number of entities named by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a PRP at the Lowry Superfund site.
This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and is managed
by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste Management). In 1990, we
recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, a portion of which was put into a
trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with Denver and Waste Management
regarding the then-outstanding litigation. Our settlement was based on an
assumed remediation cost of $120 million (in 1992 adjusted dollars). We
are obligated to pay a portion of future costs, if any, in excess of that
amount.

Waste Management provides us with updated annual cost
estimates through 2032. We reviewed these cost estimates in the assessment of
our accrual related to this issue. We use certain assumptions that differ from
Waste Management’s estimates to assess our expected liability. Our expected
liability (based on the $120 million threshold being met) is based on our
best estimates available.

The assumptions
used are as follows:

·

trust
management costs are included in projections with regard to the
$120 million threshold, but are expensed only as incurred;

·

income
taxes, which we believe are not an included cost, are excluded from projections
with regard to the $120 million threshold;

·

a
2.5% inflation rate for future costs; and

·

certain
operations and maintenance costs were discounted using a 4.60% risk-free rate of
return.

Based on these assumptions, the present value and
gross amount of the costs at December 31, 2006, are approximately
$2.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Accordingly, we believe
that the existing liability is adequate as of December 31, 2006. We did
not assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of
our liability, and none are expected.

Considering the estimates extend through the year 2032
and the related uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial
actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies and what costs are
included in the determination of when the $120 million threshold is
reached, the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. We
cannot predict the amount of any such change, but additional accruals in the
future are possible.

We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of
our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby
activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently
unaware.


In October 2006 we were notified by the EPA that
we are a PRP, along with approximately 60 other parties, at the Cooper
Drum site in southern California. Certain of Molson’s former non-beer
business operations, which were discontinued and sold in the mid-1990s prior
to the merger with Coors, were involved at this site. We responded to the
EPA with information regarding our past involvement with the site. We are not
yet able to estimate any potential liability associated with this site.

While we cannot predict
the eventual aggregate cost for environmental and related matters in which we
are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these
matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material
in any one year to our operating results, cash flows or our financial or
competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for
losses that are probable and estimable.

Indemnity Obligations—Sale of Kaiser

On January 13, 2006, we sold a 68% equity
interest in Kaiser to FEMSA for $68 million in cash, net of
$4.2 million of transaction costs, including the assumption by FEMSA of
Kaiser-related debt and contingencies. We retained a 15% interest in
Kaiser through most of 2006, and had one seat out of seven on its board. As
part of the sale, we also received a put option to sell to FEMSA our remaining
15% interest in Kaiser for the greater of $15.0 million or fair market
value through January 2009 and at fair market value thereafter. During the
fourth quarter of 2006, we exercised the put option on our remaining 15%
interest which had a carrying value of $2 million at the time of the sale, and
as a result, we have no ownership interest remaining in Kaiser as of December 31,
2006. The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for certain
exposures related to tax, civil and labor contingencies. First, we provided a
full indemnity for any losses Kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims
associated with certain previously utilized purchased tax credits. Any
potential liabilities associated with these exposures were considered less than
probable during 2005, and therefore no associated reserves were recorded in
2005. The total base amount of potential claims in this regard, plus estimated
accumulated penalties and interest, is $247 million. As of December 31,
2006, the fair value of this indemnity liability on the balance sheet was
$77.7 million, $4.0 million of which was classified as a current
liability and $73.7 million of which was classified as non-current. Our
initial fair value estimates accounted for the possibility that we could have
been required to pay the full amount of the exposure in a future year but that
a majority of the amounts paid would be recovered in subsequent years through
Brazil’s legal system. Our fair value estimates also considered, through
probability-weighted scenarios, the possibility that we would never have
to pay any amounts associated with this exposure.  Our indemnity obligations related to previously
purchased tax credits increased by $12.5 million during the fourth quarter of
2006 as a result of the exercise of the put option.

We also provided indemnity related to all other tax,
civil and labor contingencies. In this regard, however, FEMSA assumed their
full share of all contingent liabilities that had been previously recorded and
disclosed by us prior to the sale on January 13, 2006. However, we may
have to provide indemnity to FEMSA if those contingencies settle at amounts
greater than those amounts previously recorded or disclosed by us. We will be
able to offset any indemnity exposures in these circumstances with amounts that
settle favorably to amounts previously recorded. Our exposure related to these
indemnity claims is capped at the amount of the sales price of the 68% equity
interest of Kaiser, which was $68 million. As a result of these contract
provisions, our fair value estimates include not only probability-weighted
potential cash outflows associated with indemnity provisions, but also probability-weighted
cash inflows that could result from favorable settlements, which could occur
through negotiation or settlement programs that could arise from the federal or
any of the various state governments in Brazil. The fair value of this
indemnity was favorably impacted during the third quarter of 2006 as a result
of significant payments made by Kaiser under certain tax amnesty programs made
available by the Brazilian governmental authorities, resulting in significant
credits to MCBC and an overall reduction in the remaining number of Kaiser’s
outstanding tax


claims. The recorded fair
value of the total tax, civil and labor indemnity liability was $43 million on
the date of sale on January 13, 2006, and it is recorded at
$33.3 million as of December 31, 2006, $21.3 million of which is
classified as a current liability and $11.9 million of which is classified
as non-current. The exercise of the put option on our remaining 15% interest in
Kaiser increased our indemnity obligations related to tax, civil and labor
claims increased by $5.5 million during the fourth quarter. Future settlement
procedures and related negotiation activities associated with these
contingencies are largely outside of our control and will be handled by FEMSA.
The sale agreement requires annual cash settlements relating to the tax, civil
and labor indemnities, the first of which will occur during the first half of
2007. Indemnity obligations related to purchased tax credits must be settled
upon notification. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome
and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying
values of the indemnity obligations could result in the future. These
liabilities are denominated in Brazilian reals and have been stated at present
value and will, therefore, be subject in the future to foreign exchange gains
or losses and to accretion cost, both of which will be recognized in the
discontinued operations section of the statement of operations.

Montréal
Canadiens

Molson
Canada owns a 19.9% common ownership interest in the Montréal Canadiens
professional hockey club (the Club) and, prior to June 30, 2006, Molson
also owned a preferred interest. On June 30, 2006, entities which control
and own a majority of the Club purchased the preferred equity held by Molson
Canada. Subsequent to the transaction, Molson Canada still retains 19.9% common
equity interest in the Club, as well as Board representation at the Club and
related entities.

Also, coincident with the disposition of our preferred
interest, Molson Canada was released from a direct guarantee of the Club’s debt
financing. The shareholders of the Club (the majority owner and Molson Canada)
and the National Hockey League (NHL) are parties to a consent agreement, which
requires the purchaser and Molson to abide by funding requirements included in
the terms of the shareholders’ agreement. In addition, Molson Canada continues
to be a guarantor of the majority owner’s obligations under a land lease. We
have evaluated our risk exposure related to these financial guarantees recorded
the fair values of these guarantees accordingly.

Litigation and Other
Disputes

Beginning
in May 2005, several purported class actions were filed in the United
States and Canada, including Federal courts in Delaware and Colorado and
provincial courts in Ontario and Québec, alleging, among other things, that the
Company and its affiliated entities, including Molson Inc., and certain
officers and directors misled stockholders by failing to disclose first quarter
(January-March) 2005 U.S. business trends prior to the Merger vote in January 2005.
The Colorado case has since been transferred to Delaware and consolidated with
those cases. One of the lawsuits filed in Delaware federal court also


alleges that the Company failed to comply with U.S.
GAAP. The Company will vigorously defend the lawsuits.

In May 2005,
the Company was contacted by the Central Regional Office of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in Denver (the SEC) requesting the voluntary provision
of documents and other information from the Company and Molson Inc.
relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related
to the Merger, the Company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2005
and other information.  In November 2006,
the Company received a letter from the SEC stating that this matter (In the
Matter of Molson Coors Brewing Company, D-02739-A) has been
recommended for termination, and no enforcement action has been recommended to
the Commission. The information in the SEC’s letter was provided under the
guidelines in the final paragraph of Securities Act Release No. 5310.

The
Company was contacted by the New York Stock Exchange in June 2005,
requesting information in connection with events leading up to the Company’s
earnings announcement on April 28, 2005, which was the date we announced
our first quarter 2005 losses attributed to lower sales and the Merger. The
Exchange regularly conducts reviews of market activity surrounding corporate
announcements or events and has indicated that no inference of impropriety
should be drawn from its inquiry. The Company cooperated with this inquiry. As
a matter of policy, the Exchange does not comment publicly on the status of its
investigations. However, we have not been contacted by the NYSE with respect to
this investigation in approximately 18 months. If there were any formal
actions taken by the NYSE, it would be in the form of an Investigatory Panel
Decision, such Decisions are publicly available. You may contact the Exchange
directly if you would like more information.

In July 2005,
the Ontario Securities Commission (Commission) requested information related to
the trading of MCBC stock prior to April 28, 2005, which was the date we
announced our first quarter 2005 losses attributed to lower sales and the
Merger. The Company cooperated with the inquiry. The Commission has advised the
Company that it has closed the file on this matter without action of any kind.

In
early October 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of
Directors concluded its investigation of whether a complaint that it received
in the third quarter of 2005 had any merit. The complaint related primarily to
disclosure in connection with the Merger, exercises of stock options by
Molson Inc. option holders before the record date for the special dividend
paid to Molson Inc. shareholders before the Merger (which were disclosed
in the Company’s Report on Form 8-K dated February 15, 2005),
statements made concerning the special dividend to Molson Inc.
shareholders and sales of the Company’s common stock in connection with
exercise of stock options by the Company’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer following the Merger, after the release of the year-end
results for Coors and Molson Inc. and after the Company lifted the trading
restrictions imposed before the Merger. The Audit Committee’s independent
counsel, which was retained to assist in conducting the investigation, reviewed
and discussed with the staff of the SEC the various findings of an
approximately 12-month long investigation conducted by the independent
counsel. The Audit Committee determined, after thoroughly reviewing the facts,
and in consultation with its independent counsel, to conclude the
investigation. In concluding the investigation, the Audit Committee determined
that the various matters referred to in the complaint were without merit.

In December 2005,
Miller Brewing Company sued the Company and several subsidiaries in a Wisconsin
federal court. Miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement (the Agreement)
allowing Molson Canada the sole distribution of Miller products in Canada.
Miller also seeks damages for U.S. and Canadian antitrust violations, and
violations of the Agreement’s confidentiality provisions. Miller also claims that
the Agreement’s purposes have been frustrated as a result of the Merger. The
Company has filed a claim against Miller and certain related entities in
Ontario, Canada, seeking a declaration that the licensing agreement remains in
full force and effect. We are currently in discussions with Miller regarding a
resolution of this dispute. There can be no assurances that we will arrive at
such a resolution.

In
late October 2006, Molson Canada received a letter from Foster’s Group
Limited providing twelve months’ notice of its intention to terminate the
Foster’s U.S. License Agreement due to the Merger. The


Agreement provides Molson Canada with the right to
produce Foster’s beer for the U.S. marketplace. In November 2006, Molson
Canada filed a notice of action in Ontario, Canada disputing the validity of
the termination notice. In December 2006, Foster’s filed a separate
application in Ontario, Canada seeking termination of the Agreement. Molson
Canada will vigorously defend its rights in these matters.

Molson
Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued
in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. The
suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege that each defendant
intentionally marketed its products to “children and other underage consumers.”
In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and
guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. In each suit, the
manufacturers have advanced motions for dismissal to the court. Several of the
lawsuits have been dismissed on appeal. There have been no appellate decisions.
We will vigorously defend these cases and it is not possible at this time to
estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, related to these lawsuits.

CBL
replaced a bonus plan in the United Kingdom with a different plan under which a
bonus was not paid in 2003. A group of employees pursued a claim against CBL
with respect to this issue with an employment tribunal. During the second
quarter of 2005, the tribunal ruled against CBL. CBL appealed this ruling, and
the appeal was heard in the first quarter of 2006, where most impacts of the
initial tribunal judgments were overturned. However, the employment appeal
tribunal remitted two specific issues back to a new employment tribunal. CBL
appealed the employment appeal tribunal’s judgment. In January 2007, the
appeal decision ruled in the Company’s favor, holding that the employment
tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the employees’ claims, and the claims were
dismissed. It is possible that the employees may attempt to advance their
claims in a different forum.

We are involved in other disputes and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to
predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on
a review with legal counsel, none of these disputes and legal actions is
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters, including the
above-described advertising practices case, may arise from time to time
that may harm our business.

Insurance

We are self-insured for certain insurable risks
consisting primarily of employee health insurance programs, as well as workers’
compensation, general liability, automobile liability and property insurance
deductibles or retentions. During 2005 we fully insured future risks for
long-term disability, and, in most states, workers’ compensation, but
maintained a self-insured position for workers’ compensation for certain
self-insured states and for claims incurred prior to the inception of the
insurance coverage in Colorado in 1997. Our reserves accrued at December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005, were $18.5 million and
$19.3 million, respectively.

22.   Supplemental
Guarantor Information

In 2002, our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBC (2002
Issuer), completed a placement of $850 million principal amount of 6


¤


% Senior notes
due 2012. The notes with registration rights are guaranteed on a senior and
unsecured basis by MCBC (Parent Guarantor), Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC
(the 2005 Issuer) and certain domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors).
The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. A significant
amount of the 2002 Issuer’s income and cash flow is generated by its
subsidiaries. As a result, funds necessary to meet the Issuer’s debt service
obligations are provided in large part by distributions or advances from its
subsidiaries. Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions,
as well as our financial condition and operating requirements and those of
certain domestic subsidiaries, could limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash
for the purpose of meeting its debt service obligation including the payment of
principal and interest on the notes.


On September 22, 2005, our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC (2005 Issuer), completed a private
placement of approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of Senior notes
due as follows:

U.S. $300 million 4.85% notes due 2010

CAD $900 million 5.00% notes due 2015

The notes were issued with registration rights and are
guaranteed on a senior and unsecured basis by MCBC (Parent Guarantor) and
certain domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors), including CBC (the 2002
Issuer). The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Funds
necessary to meet the 2005 Issuer’s debt service obligations are provided in
large part by distributions or advances from MCBC’s other subsidiaries,
including Molson Inc., a non-guarantor. Under certain circumstances,
contractual and legal restrictions, as well as our financial condition and
operating requirements, could limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash for the
purpose of meeting its debt service obligation including the payment of principal
and interest on the notes.

The following information
sets forth our Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31,
2006, and December 25, 2005, and the Condensed Consolidating Statements of
Operations and the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows for the
three years ended December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26,
2004. Investments in our subsidiaries are accounted for on the equity method;
accordingly, entries necessary to consolidate the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers, and all of our subsidiaries are reflected in the eliminations column.
In the opinion of management, separate complete financial statements of the
Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors would not provide additional material
information that would be useful in assessing their financial composition.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including our Global Chief Executive Officer and
Global Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing
the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature,
can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management’s control
objectives. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities that
we do not control or manage. Consequently, our disclosure controls and
procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more
limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

The Global Chief Executive Officer
and the Global Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of
management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2006 and, based on
their evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

The
certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 hereto should be read
in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a—15(f). The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.
S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Global Chief Executive Officer
and the Global Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of
management, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on


its
evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

The
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued
their report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 which
appears herein.

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

As
previously reported in our first quarter 2005 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A,
we had identified a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting with respect to accounting for income taxes, which continued to exist
as of December 25, 2005.  Our
remediation plan included the following activities:

·

We
hired additional experienced tax staff including a new vice president of tax
and two additional senior level tax managers;

·

We
implemented additional procedures to ensure adequate levels of review in this
area; and

·

We
implemented new tax provision calculation software that has improved transparency,
automated calculations and improved controls surrounding accounting for income
taxes, particularly with respect to the global tax provision preparation.

As of December 31, 2006, we completed the
execution of our remediation plan, evaluated and tested the effectiveness of
these controls as of December 31, 2006 and determined that the material
weakness related to income tax accounting has been remediated.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
2006, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

We
may issue securities under our equity compensation plan in forms other than

EI plan, we may issue restricted stock awards, as that term is defined in the
EI plan.

(2)

In
connection with the Merger, we exchanged approximately 1.3 million Molson stock
options for Molson Coors stock options under our EI plan.  In order to accommodate the exchange, the
Compensation Committee for the Coors Board of Directors approved 5.0 million
shares for exchange under the EI plan in 2005.

As of December 31,
2006, there were 314,247 restricted stock units (RSUs) outstanding. These
include shares with respect to which restrictions on ownership (i.e., vesting
periods) lapsed as of the Merger on February 9, 2005, as well as RSUs
issued subsequent to the Merger. RSUs previously were granted only to
executives. These restricted shares, along with common stock convertible
equivalent units, accrue dividends which will be convertible into MCBC Class B
stock at the end of three years and were offered to a broader mix of
employees beginning in 2006. These instruments are meant to reward exceptional
performance and encourage retention. The number granted each year, if any, will
be based upon performance.

All unvested securities
issued under the EI Plan and the Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors vested immediately upon the Merger.
