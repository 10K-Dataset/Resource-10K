ITEM 1. Business

(a)  General Development of Business

Founded in 1873 and incorporated in Colorado in 1913, Adolph
Coors Company (ACC or the Company) is the holding company for
Coors Brewing Company (CBC), the third-largest U.S. brewer.

CBC owns Coors Distributing Company (CDC) and several smaller
subsidiaries, including Coors Transportation Company; Coors
Energy Company (CEC); the majority of The Wannamaker Ditch
Company and The Rocky Mountain Water Company, which carry process
water from nearby Clear Creek to various CBC reservoirs in the
Golden area; Coors Brewing Company International, Inc. (CBCI);
Coors Global, Inc. (Global); Coors Intercontinental, Inc. (Intercontinental);
Coors Nova Scotia Co. and Coors Japan Company, Ltd. (Coors Japan).

CDC owns and operates distributorships in several markets across
the United States. CDC's 1997 operations accounted for approximately 
5.7% of CBC's total beer sales volume.

Through a subsidiary, CEC continues to operate a gas transmission
pipeline that provides energy to CBC's Shenandoah facility.

CBC, CBCI, Global and Intercontinental own Coors Brewing
International C.V. (the CV), which in turn owns Coors Brewing
Iberica, S.A. (Coors Iberica) and Coors Services, S.A. Established in 
1995, Coors Services, S.A. provides management and administrative services 
to CBC. The CV acts as a holding company and a finance subsidiary.

Coors Brewing International, Ltd. (CBIL), owned by ACC and based
in London, was created in December 1997. Effective January 1,
1998, it provides management and administrative services to CBC.
CBIL also provides sales and distribution services for Coors
products in European markets other than Spain.

In addition to CBC and CBIL, ACC owns Coors Canada, Inc. (CCI),
which in turn owns a 50.1% interest in Coors Canada, a
partnership. CCI's partners in Coors Canada, Carling O'Keefe
Breweries of Canada, Ltd. (Carling) and The Molson Company, Ltd.
(Molson Company), each own equal minority interests in the
partnership. The partnership, which began operations January 1,
1998, is to develop the business related to Coors products in
Canada. The partnership agreement replaces the interim arrangement 
that the Company and Molson Company operated under during 1997. See 
further discussion of the Canadian business under section (c) below.

Some of the following statements describe the Company's expectations of future 
products and business plans, financial results, performance and events. 
Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company has continuing operations in a single industry
segment, the production and marketing of malt-based beverages.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Coors Brewing Company - General

CBC produces, markets and sells high-quality malt-based
beverages. CBC concentrates on distinctive premium and above-
premium brands that provide higher-than-average margins. Most of
CBC's sales are in U.S. markets; however, the Company is
committed to building profitable sales in international markets.
Sales of malt beverages totaled 20.6 million barrels in 1997,
20.0 million barrels in 1996 and 20.3 million barrels in 1995.
(See Item 7 for discussion of changes in volume.)

Marketing

Principal products and services:  CBC currently has 18 brands in
its portfolio, of which five are premium products that make up
the Coors family of beers:  Coors Light(R), Original Coors(R), Coors(R)
Extra Gold, Coors(R) Dry and Coors(R) Non-Alcoholic. CBC also produces and
markets Zima(R), an innovative malt-based, above-premium beverage.

CBC offers specialty, above-premium beers, including Winterfest(R);
Blue Moon(TM) Honey Blonde Ale; Blue Moon(TM) Belgian White Ale; Blue
Moon(TM) Raspberry Cream Ale; Blue Moon(TM) Abbey Ale and Blue Moon(TM) 
Harvest Pumpkin Ale, a seasonal product. CBC also sells licensed products, 
including George Killian's(R) Irish Red(TM) Lager and George Killian's(R) 
Irish(TM) Honey. CBC distributed Steinlager(R), New Zealand's number-one 
premium beer, under license from Lion Nathan International of New Zealand until
the end of 1997.

CBC also sells popular-priced products, including Keystone(R)
Premium, Keystone(R) Light, Keystone(R) Dry and Keystone(R) Ice.

CBC's beverages are sold throughout the United States. CBC exports or produces
and sells many products overseas, as described in greater detail below.

CBC owns and operates The Sandlot Brewery(R) at Coors Field(R)
ballpark in Denver, Colorado. This brewery, which is open year-
round, makes a variety of specialty beers and has an annual
capacity of approximately 4,000 barrels.

New products/opportunities: Blue Moon Abbey Ale was introduced in 
February 1997.

During 1997, Coors Artic Ice(R) and Coors Artic Ice Light(R), Herman 
Joseph's(R), Blue Moon(TM) Nut Brown Ale, Killian's(R) Irish Brown(TM), 
Coors(R) Cutter and Keystone(R) Amber Light were discontinued because the
market performances of these products did not meet expectations.

Brand names, trademarks, patents and licenses:  CBC owns trademarks on 
all brands it produces and recognizes that consumer knowledge of and 
loyalty to its brand names and trademarks are vital to CBC's long-term 
success. It also holds several patents, with expiration dates ranging from 
1998 to 2018, on innovative processes related to product formulae, can 
making, can decorating and certain other technical operations, together with 
several design patents for innovative packaging. CBC receives revenue from 
royalties and licenses, but its business is not dependent upon this revenue.

Brand performance:  Coors Light is CBC's best-selling brand and has generated
more than two-thirds of its total sales volume for the past three years. CBC's
second-most-popular brand is Original Coors. Premium and above-premium beers
accounted for approximately 88% of CBC's total 1997 sales volume.

Domestic sales:  The Company's highest-volume states are California, Texas, 
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, comprising 47% of total domestic volume.

Eight geographic field business areas manage domestic sales which
allow CBC to better anticipate and respond to wholesaler and consumer needs.

International business:  Through its U.S. and foreign production
facilities, CBC markets its products to approximately 37 international 
markets and to U.S. military bases worldwide. Export sales are more 
profitable, on a per-barrel basis, than domestic sales.

Under an interim agreement that was in effect until January 1, 1998, Molson 
Breweries of Canada Limited (Molson) brewed and distributed Original Coors 
and Coors Light in Canada, where Coors Light is the best-selling light beer.
After Molson permitted Miller Brewing Company (Miller) to purchase a 20% 
ownership interest in Molson in 1993, the Company initiated two legal actions
regarding its licensing arrangement with Molson. On October 18, 1996, an 
arbitration panel ruled that the licensing agreement terminated in 1993 when 
Miller acquired its ownership interest in Molson. This ruling returned 
Canadian rights to all CBC brands to CBC and required Molson to compensate 
CBC for the period beginning April 2, 1993. In April 1997, the Company
settled all legal disputes among CBC, Molson, Miller and related parties. 
Under terms of the settlement, Molson paid the Company approximately $72 
million, which was included in ACC's second quarter 1997 results as a 
special credit net of certain related legal expenses. The arbitration panel 
also found that Molson had underpaid royalties from January 1, 1991, to 
April 1, 1993. Molson paid CBC $6.1 million in cash (net of $680,000 of
withholding taxes) during 1996 to cover the unpaid royalties plus interest.

Coors Canada began operations January 1, 1998, to develop the business 
related to Coors products in Canada. Under the partnership agreement, 
Coors Canada is responsible for marketing Coors products in Canada, while 
the partnership contracts with Molson Breweries for the brewing, 
distribution and sales of these brands. Coors Canada receives an amount 
from Molson Breweries generally equal to net sales revenue generated from 
the Coors brands less production, distribution, sales and overhead costs
related to these sales.

Coors Japan, the exclusive importer of Coors products into Japan
and based in Tokyo, distributes, markets and sells CBC's products
in Japan, where the Coors brand has been one of the top three
foreign premium brands for 10 years.

Beginning in 1991, CBC formed Jinro-Coors Brewing Company (JCBC),
a joint venture with Jinro Limited of the Republic of Korea.
Until late 1997, CBC owned one-third of JCBC, while Jinro Limited
owned the remaining two-thirds. JCBC's financial results have not
been included in CBC's financial statements, as CBC's investment
is accounted for under the cost basis of accounting, since it has
not had the ability to significantly influence JCBC's business
operations and the investment has been considered temporary. In
December 1997, CBC exercised the put option it held on its $22-
million investment in JCBC, which requires Jinro Limited to
purchase, in Korean Won, CBC's investment at the greater of cost
or market value by June 24, 1998. See Items 7 and 8 for further
discussion of this matter.

In March 1994, Coors Iberica purchased a 500,000-hectoliter
brewery in Zaragoza, Spain, from El Aguila S.A. of Madrid, Spain,
which is owned 51% by Amsterdam-based Heineken, N.V. (the world's
second-largest brewer). Coors Iberica brews Coorsr Gold for sale
in Spain and the Coorsr Extra Gold brand for export to
approximately 14 international markets. El Aguila and Coors
jointly distribute Coors products in Spain, while Coors manages
marketing efforts. This arrangement provides certain advantages
over exporting products directly from U.S. facilities. Financial
results of the Zaragoza brewery are included in ACC's financial statements.

Since September 1992, a licensing agreement has been in place
that allows Scottish Courage to brew and distribute Coorsr Extra
Gold in the United Kingdom. A joint venture between CBC and
Scottish Courage has marketed the product during this period.
Beginning in early 1998, Coors' Zaragoza, Spain brewery will be
the source for Coorsr Extra Gold to be sold in the United Kingdom, 
and Scottish Courage will continue to distribute the product. Scottish 
Courage will continue to perform some packaging services.

In early 1996, ACC established a foreign sales corporation, Coors Export Ltd.,
to utilize favorable U.S. tax laws applicable to foreign sales.

Product distribution:  A national network of 558 independent
distributors and four distributorships owned and operated by CDC
deliver CBC products to U.S. retail markets. Some distributors
operate multiple branches, bringing the total number of U.S.
distributor/branch locations to 611. Independent distributors
deliver CBC products to some export/international markets under
certain licensing and distribution agreements.

To ensure the highest product quality, CBC monitors distributors'
methods of handling Coors products. This monitoring helps ensure
adherence to proper refrigeration and rotation guidelines for
CBC's malt beverages at both wholesale and retail locations.
Distributors are required to replace CBC products if consumer
sales have not occurred within prescribed time frames.

Transportation

Given the location of its three production facilities in the
U.S., CBC must ship its products a greater distance than most
competitors. By packaging some products in the Memphis and
Shenandoah facilities, CBC improves the efficiency of
distribution and lowers freight costs to certain markets. Major
competitors have multiple breweries from which to deliver
products, thereby incurring lower transportation costs than CBC.

Approximately 44% of the products packaged at CBC's production
facilities are transported by railcar to satellite redistribution
centers or directly to distributors throughout the country. The
railcars assigned to CBC are specially built and insulated to keep Coors 
products cold en route. Any disruption by strike in the rail industry 
would impact CBC more than its major competitors, but, in management's 
opinion, the risk of such disruption appears low.

The remaining 56% of products are shipped by truck and intermodal
(piggyback) directly to distributors or to satellite redistribution 
centers. Transportation vehicles are also refrigerated or insulated to 
keep CBC's malt beverages at proper temperatures while in transit.

CBC currently uses 14 strategically located satellite redistribution 
centers to receive product from production facilities and to prepare 
shipments to distributors. In 1997, approximately 60% of packaged products 
were shipped direct to distributors, and approximately 40% moved through the 
satellite redistribution centers.

Operations

Production/packaging capacity:  CBC currently has three domestic
production facilities. It owns and operates the world's largest
single-site brewery in Golden, Colorado; a packaging and brewing
facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and a packaging and distribution
facility near Elkton, Virginia (referred to as the Shenandoah facility).

The Golden brewery is the source location for all brands with the
Coors name except for Coors Non-Alcoholic. Approximately 65% of
CBC's beer is packaged in Golden; most of the remainder is
shipped in bulk from the Golden brewery to the Memphis and
Shenandoah facilities for blending, finishing and packaging.

The Memphis facility currently packages all products exported
from the United States and brews and packages Zima, Killian's
Irish Honey, Coors Non-Alcoholic, and all of the Blue Moon
products. CBC also contract brews small volumes of several products for 
other companies at the Memphis facility. Depending on product mix and 
market opportunities, the full utilization of brewing capacity in Memphis 
may or may not require additions to plant and equipment.

The Shenandoah facility currently packages certain CBC products
for distribution to Eastern U.S. markets and could be expanded if
necessary and if opportunities warranted the required financial commitment.

At the end of 1997, CBC had approximately 25 million barrels of
annual brewing capacity and 30 million barrels of annual
packaging capacity. Current capacity depends upon product mix and
may change with shifting consumer preferences for specific brands
or packages. CBC's three facilities provide sufficient brewing
and packaging capacity to meet foreseeable consumer demand.

Most of CBC's aluminum can, end, glass bottle and malt
requirements are produced in owned facilities or facilities
operated by joint ventures in which CBC is a partner. CBC has
arranged for sufficient container supplies with its joint venture
partners and has sufficient malting facilities to fulfill its
current and projected requirements.

Container manufacturing facilities:  CBC owns a can manufacturing
facility that produces approximately 3.8 billion aluminum cans
per year, and an aluminum can end manufacturing facility, which
provides CBC aluminum ends and tabs. Total container properties
comprise approximately 9.0% of the book value of CBC's
properties. In 1994, CBC and American National Can Company (ANC)
formed a joint venture to produce beverage cans and ends at CBC's
manufacturing facilities for sale to CBC and outside customers.
The joint venture's initial term is seven years but can be
extended for two additional three-year terms. The joint venture
has improved the technology and utilization of both facilities
and has enhanced the returns on this investment. In 1997, CBC
purchased approximately 96% of the cans produced by the joint
venture. The joint venture is committed to supplying 100% of the
Golden facility's can and end requirements.

In June 1995, CBC and Anchor Glass Container Corporation (Anchor)
established a joint venture partnership, the Rocky Mountain
Bottle Company (RMBC), to produce glass bottles at the CBC glass
manufacturing facility. The joint venture has lowered unit costs,
increased output and created efficiencies at the glass plant. CBC
contributed approximately $16.2 million in machinery, equipment and 
certain personal property to RMBC. The partnership's initial term is 
10 years (ending 2005) and can be extended for additional two-year periods.

Effective February 5, 1997, Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc.
(Owens) replaced Anchor as CBC's partner in RMBC as a result of
Anchor's bankruptcy in September 1996 and the related sale of
certain Anchor assets to Owens and Consumers Packaging, Inc.
Further, Owens has replaced Anchor as the 100% preferred supplier
of bottles to CBC for bottle requirements not met by RMBC. Owens'
replacement of Anchor did not significantly impact RMBC's operations.

In 1997, RMBC produced approximately 871 million bottles; CBC
purchased approximately 97% of the bottles produced. To assist in
accomplishment of its goal of manufacturing bottles with recycled
material, CBC constructed a glass recycling facility in Wheat
Ridge, Colorado, in 1994 and doubled the amount of glass the
facility can recycle annually. RMBC operates the recycling facility.

Other facilities:  CBC owns waste treatment facilities that process waste 
from CBC's manufacturing operations and from the City of Golden.

In September 1995, CBC sold its power plant equipment and support
facilities to Trigen-Nations Energy Corporation, L.L.L.P.
(Trigen) for approximately $22 million. CBC has agreed to
purchase from Trigen the electricity and steam needed to operate
its Golden facilities. This 25-year agreement also requires that
significant capital improvements be made by Trigen.

CBC continues to improve asset utilization by divesting non-core
assets and by continuing to improve capacity utilization through joint 
ventures and alliances. CBC is exploring a combination of capital 
improvements and outsourcing to provide for its long-term malting needs.

Capital improvements:  In 1997, the Company spent approximately
$60 million in capital expenditures. While management plans to
invest appropriately in order to ensure ongoing productivity and
efficiency of CBC assets, a high priority will be given to those
projects the Company believes offer attractive returns. The
Company expects its capital expenditures for 1998 to be in the
range of $75 to $85 million.

Raw Materials/Sources and Availability

CBC's beers are made with all natural ingredients, and its
brewing cycle is one of the longest in the industry. CBC adheres
to strict formulation and quality standards in selecting its raw
materials and believes it has sufficient access to raw materials
and packaging supplies to meet its quality and production requirements.

Barley, barley malt, starch and hops:  CBC uses proprietary
strains of barley, developed by its own agronomists, in most of
its malt beverages. Virtually all of this barley is grown on
irrigated farmland in the western United States under contractual
agreements with area farmers. CBC's malting facility in Golden
produces malt for all CBC products except Blue Moon. CBC maintains 
inventory levels in owned locations sufficient to continue production 
in the event of any disruption in barley or malt supplies.

Rice and refined cereal starch (which are interchangeable in
CBC's brewing process) and foreign and domestic hops are purchased from 
outside suppliers. Adequate inventories are maintained to continue 
production through any foreseeable disruption in supply.

Water:  CBC uses naturally filtered water from underground
aquifers to brew malt beverages at its Golden facility. Water
from private deep wells is used for brewing, final blending and
packaging operations at plants located outside Colorado. Water
quality and composition were primary factors in all facility site selections.
Water from CBC's sources in Golden and Memphis is well balanced with 
minerals and dissolved solids to brew high-quality malt beverages.

CBC continually monitors the quality of all the water used in its
brewing and blending processes for compliance with its own
stringent quality standards as well as applicable federal and
state water standards. CBC owns water rights believed to be
adequate to meet all of its present requirements for both brewing
and industrial uses; however, it continues to acquire water
rights and add water reservoir capacity, as appropriate, to
provide for long-term strategic growth plans and to sustain
brewing operations in the event of a prolonged drought.

Packaging materials:  During 1997, approximately 60% of CBC's
malt beverages were packaged in aluminum cans. CBC purchases most
of its cans and ends from the joint venture with ANC. Aluminum
cans for products packaged at the Memphis plant are purchased
from an outside supplier.

Glass bottles were used to package approximately 29% of CBC's
beverages in 1997; about half of these bottles were produced by RMBC.

The remainder (11%) of the malt beverages sold during 1997 was
packaged primarily in quarter- and half-barrel stainless steel kegs.

Graphic Packaging Corporation, a subsidiary of ACX Technologies,
Inc. (ACX), supplies much of the secondary packaging for CBC's
products, including bottle labels and paperboard products.

Supply contracts with ACX companies:  When ACX Technologies, Inc.
(ACX) was spun off from ACC in 1992, CBC negotiated long-term
supply contracts with certain ACX subsidiaries for aluminum,
starch and packaging materials. These contracts, negotiated at
market prices, were to be in effect through 1997. The aluminum
contracts were canceled in 1995, and the starch contract was extended 
in 1997 to run through 1999. The contract for packaging materials was 
modified in 1997 and extended until at least 1999. See Item 13, Certain 
Relationships and Related Transactions for further details.

Energy:  CBC purchases electricity and steam for its Golden
manufacturing facilities from Trigen. CEC supplies Trigen with
coal for its steam generator system. CBC does not anticipate
future energy supply problems.

Seasonality of the Business

The beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation. CBC's
sales volumes are normally at their lowest in the first and
fourth quarters and highest in the second and third quarters. The
Company's fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the
last Sunday in December. The 1997 and 1996 fiscal years were 52
weeks long, while fiscal 1995 was 53 weeks long.

Research and Project Development

CBC's research and project development spending relates primarily
to new products and packages; brewing processes, ingredients and
equipment; packaging supplies and environmental improvements and
cost reductions in processes and packaging materials. These
activities are meant to improve the quality and value of CBC's
products while reducing costs through more efficient processing
and packaging techniques and equipment design, as well as improved 
raw materials. Approximately $14.6 million, $15.3 million and $16.3 
million were spent on research and development in 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively. The Company expects to spend approximately $14.1 million 
on research and project development in 1998.

To support new product development, CBC maintains a fully equipped pilot 
brewery, with a 6,500-barrel annual capacity, within the Golden facility 
enabling CBC to brew small batches of innovative products without 
interrupting ongoing production and operations in the main brewery.

Regulations

Federal laws and regulations govern the operations of breweries;
the federal government and all states regulate trade practices,
product content and labeling, advertising and marketing practices, 
distributor relationships and related matters. Governmental entities 
also levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and 
may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Many foreign governments apply tariffs on products such as CBC's when 
exported into their nations. The Company must also deal with varying 
levels and types of foreign government regulation when attempting to sell 
its products in those countries.

A number of emerging regulatory/legislative issues could impact
the Company's business operations over the next few years,
including:  i) potential increases in federal, state and local excise 
taxes; ii) restrictions on the advertising and sale of alcohol beverages; 
iii) new packaging regulations and taxes; iv) and others.

Federal excise taxes on malt beverages are currently $18 per
barrel. State excise taxes also are levied at rates that ranged
in 1997 from a high of $32.65 per barrel in Alabama to a low of
$0.62 per barrel in Wyoming, with an average of $7.69 per barrel.
In 1997, CBC recognized approximately $386 million in federal and
state excise taxes. A substantial increase in federal or state
excise taxes would have a negative impact on sales and
profitability of the entire industry, including CBC. CBC is
vigorously opposed to any increases in federal, state or local
excise taxes and will work diligently to ensure that its view is represented.

The Company anticipates increased scrutiny and focus on alcohol
advertising and underage consumption among lawmakers and advocacy
groups. The increased scrutiny is due to a number of circumstances 
outside the control of CBC. CBC intends to strengthen its and support 
the industry's self-regulation activities, including continuing efforts 
that demonstrate its social responsibility in advertising, sales, 
community education and prevention and research.

Environmental

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations did not materially affect the Company's 1997 capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

The Company continues to promote the efficient use of resources,
waste reduction and pollution prevention. Programs currently
under way include recycling, down-weighting of product packages
and, where practical, increasing the recycled content of product
packaging materials, paper and other supplies. Several employee
task forces continually seek effective ways to control hazardous
materials and to reduce emissions and waste.

Employees and Employee Relations

The Company has approximately 5,800 full-time employees. Of CBC's
three domestic production facilities, Memphis plant workers are the only 
significant employee group that has union representation (Teamsters). In 
general, relations with employees have been satisfactory.

Competitive Conditions

Known trends and competitive conditions:  Industry and competitive 
information was compiled from the following industry sources:  Beer 
Marketer's Insights and The Maxwell Consumer Report. While management 
believes these sources are reliable, the Company cannot guarantee the 
absolute accuracy of these numbers and estimates.

1997 industry overview:  The beer industry in the United States
is highly competitive. Industry volume growth has averaged less
than 1% annually since 1991. In one of the most competitive years
of the decade, 1997 saw domestic beer industry shipments decline
slightly. By contrast, 1996 domestic shipments were up 0.8% from
the year before. In recent years, brewers have attempted to gain
market share through competitive pricing, marketing, promotions
and innovative packaging. In 1997, price promotions and price
discounting were more extensive than a year earlier,
significantly reducing revenue growth for major U.S. brewers.
Revenue per barrel for the two largest U.S. brewers declined in
1997, despite modest posted price increases early in the year.

The pricing environment continues to be very competitive; no
nationwide increases in beer prices were announced late in 1997
or early in 1998. Instead of a posted price increase, the two
largest U.S. brewers have announced plans to reduce the depth and
duration of price discounting in 1998. If competitors concentrate
primarily on market share gains in 1998 instead of profitability,
it will place additional downward pressure on pricing. Unit
volume growth for major U.S. brewers continues to depend on
growth in light beer sales, pricing, introductions of new
products and expansion into international markets.

A number of important trends continued in the U.S. beer market in
1997. The first was a trend toward "trading up." Consumers
continued to move away from lower-priced brands to higher-priced
brands, especially imports. Unlike in recent years,
microbreweries as a group did not benefit from this trend in
1997. Sales by micros were flat for 1997 after years of double-
digit growth in this segment. In fact, sales for six of the ten
largest microbrewers were down in 1997, with the top ten as a group down 
1%. In contrast, imports' sales volume rose more than 10% in 1997.

The recent proliferation of products continued to slow as major
brewers focused efforts on their core brands. In 1997, CBC
continued to eliminate product variations by reducing the number
of brands by seven, or 28% of its portfolio. CBC now offers 18 products.

The U.S. brewing industry also continues to consolidate,
primarily at the wholesale level. As a leading example, Miller
Brewing Company (Miller) has reduced the number of Miller
distributors to 729 in 1997 from 906 in 1995 and intends to
reduce this number to approximately 500 by 2002.

CBC competitive position:  CBC's malt beverages compete with
numerous above-premium, premium, low-calorie, popular-priced, non-
alcohol and imported brands produced by national, regional, local
and international brewers. Nearly 86% of U.S. beer volume is
attributable to the top four domestic brewers:  Anheuser-Busch,
Inc. (AB); Philip Morris, Inc., through its subsidiary Miller;
CBC; and The Stroh Brewery Company (now including G. Heileman
Brewing). CBC competes most directly with AB and Miller, the
dominant companies in the industry. CBC is the nation's third-
largest brewer and, according to Beer Marketer's Insights
estimates, accounted for approximately 10.3% of the total 1997
U.S. brewing industry shipments of malt beverages (including
exports and U.S. shipments of imports). This compares to AB's
45.5% share and Miller's 21.8% share.

Given its industry position, CBC continues to face significant
competitive disadvantages related to economies of scale. Besides
lower transportation costs achieved by competitors with multiple
breweries, these larger brewers also recognize economies of scale
in advertising expenditures because of their greater volume. CBC,
in an effort to achieve and maintain national advertising
exposure, must spend substantially more per barrel of beer sold
than its major competitors. Significant levels of advertising are
necessary for CBC to hold and increase its U.S. market share.
Additionally, CBC is competitively disadvantaged in some markets
because its distributors have lower average annual sales than
distributors of competing brewers in same markets. This, coupled
with ongoing price competition, puts more pressure on CBC's
margins in comparison to those of CBC's principal competitors.

The original brewery site at Golden, which is approximately 2,400
acres, contains brewing, packaging, can manufacturing and related
facilities, as well as gravel deposits and water-storage facilities.

CBC's can and end plants are operated by a joint venture between CBC and ANC.
CBC's bottle plant is operated by a joint venture between CBC and Owens.

The distribution warehouses are operated by CDC.

The Company owns 2,700 acres of land in Rockingham County,
Virginia, where the Shenandoah facility is located, and 132 acres
in Shelby County, Tennessee, where the Memphis facility is located.

All of the Company's facilities are well-maintained and suitable
for their respective operations. In 1997, CBC estimates that its
brewing facilities operated at approximately 83% of the 1998
brewing capacity and its packaging facilities operated at
approximately 68% of the 1998 packaging capacity. Annual
production capacity can vary due to product and packaging mix and seasonality.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

See the Environmental section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion 
of the Company's obligation for potential remediation costs at the Lowry 
Landfill Superfund site and related legal proceedings.

The Company is party to numerous other legal proceedings arising
from its business operations. In each proceeding, the Company is
vigorously defending the allegations. Although the eventual
outcome of the various proceedings cannot be predicted, no single
such proceeding and no group of such similar matters are expected
to result in liability that would be material to the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

Adolph Coor Company (ACC or the Company) is the holding company for Coors 
Brewing Company (CBC), which produces and markets high-quality 
malt-based beverages.

This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting ACC's
consolidated results of operations, liquidity and capital resources for
the three-year period ended December 28, 1997, and should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto
included elsewhere in this report.

ACC's fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Sunday
in December. The 1997 and 1996 fiscal years were 52 weeks long, while
fiscal 1995 was 53 weeks long.

Certain unusual or nonrecurring items impacted ACC's financial results
for 1997, 1996 and 1995; restatement of results excluding special items
permits clear evaluation of its ongoing operations. These special items
are summarized below.

Summary of operating results:

                                             For the years ended
                              December 28,      December 29,     December 31,
                                     1997              1996             1995
                                    (In thousands, except earnings per share)
Operating income:
  As reported                    $147,399           $81,019          $80,378
  Excluding special items        $115,882           $87,360          $65,178
Net income:
  As reported                    $ 82,260           $43,425          $43,178
  Excluding special items        $ 68,309           $47,299          $33,944
Earnings per share:
  As reported - basic               $2.21             $1.14            $1.13
              - diluted             $2.16             $1.14            $1.13
  Excluding special items - basic   $1.84             $1.25            $0.89
                          - diluted $1.80             $1.24            $0.89

1997:  For the 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 1997, ACC
reported net income of $82.3 million, or $2.21 per basic share ($2.16
per diluted share). During 1997, the Company received a $71.5-million
payment from Molson Breweries of Canada Limited (Molson Breweries) to
settle legal disputes with ACC and CBC, less approximately $3.2 million
in related legal expenses. ACC also recorded a $22.4-million reserve
related to the recoverability of CBC's investment in Jinro-Coors
Brewing Company of Korea, as well as a $14.4-million charge related to
CBC's brewery in Zaragoza, Spain, for the impairment of certain long-
lived assets and goodwill and for severance costs for a limited workforce 
reduction. These special items amounted to a credit of $31.5 million to 
pretax income, or $0.37 per basic share ($0.36 per diluted share), after 
tax. Without this special credit, ACC would have reported net earnings of 
$68.3 million, or $1.84 per basic share ($1.80 per diluted share).

1996:  For the 52-week fiscal year ended December 29, 1996, ACC
reported net income of $43.4 million, or $1.14 per basic and diluted
share. During 1996, the Company received royalties and interest from
Molson in response to the October 1996 arbitration ruling that Molson
had underpaid royalties from January 1, 1991, to April 1, 1993.
Further, ACC recorded a gain from the 1995 curtailment of certain
postretirement benefits, charges for Molson-related legal expenses and
severance expenses for a limited work force reduction. These special
items amounted to a pretax charge of $6.3 million, or $0.11 per basic
share ($.10 per diluted share), after tax. Without this net special
charge, ACC would have reported net earnings of $47.3 million, or $1.25
per basic share ($1.24 per diluted share).

1995:  For the 53-week fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, ACC
reported net income of $43.2 million, or $1.13 per basic and diluted
share. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a gain from the
curtailment of certain postretirement benefits and a severance charge
for a limited work force reduction. These special items amounted to a
pretax credit of $15.2 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share,
after tax. ACC would have reported net income of $33.9 million, or
$0.89 per basic and diluted share, without this net special credit.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS - 1997 VS. 1996 AND 1996
VS. 1995 (EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS)

1997 vs. 1996:  Net sales increased 4.6% driven primarily by an
increase in unit volume of 2.7%. This increase in net sales was also
attributable to increased international sales, which generate higher
revenue per barrel than domestic sales; greater revenues related to the
Canadian business due to the favorable impact of the interim agreement
in effect during the year with Molson Breweries and net price increases.

Gross profit in 1997 rose 14.2% to $701.4 million from 1996 due to the
4.6% increase in net sales, as discussed above, along with a 0.6%
reduction in cost of goods sold. Increases in cost of goods caused by
higher sales volume were offset by reduced can costs; higher income
recognized from the CBC's joint ventures which produce bottles and
cans; lower costs related to fixed asset write-offs; lower costs for
employee benefits and less depreciation expense.

Operating income increased 32.6% to $115.9 million in 1997 as a result
of the higher gross profit discussed above, offset by an 11.1% increase
in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs
increased 8.5% over 1996, with increased marketing investment in
premium brands and international advertising costs. General and
administrative costs increased primarily due to incentive compensation;
continued investment in both domestic and international sales
organizations; higher costs of operating distributorships (a
distributorship was acquired in mid-1997) and increases in
administrative and start-up costs for certain foreign operations.

Net non-operating expenses in 1997 declined significantly from 1996
because of a 62.1% decrease in net interest expense partially offset by
a 26.7% decrease in miscellaneous income. Increased cash and investment
balances attributed to improved cash flow resulted in higher interest
income on investments, causing the change in net interest expense.
Decreased royalties earned on certain can production technologies
caused the decrease in miscellaneous income.

The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 40.8% in 1997 from 41.8%
in 1996 primarily due to higher tax-exempt income and foreign tax
credits. The 1997 effective tax rate exceeded the statutory rate
primarily because of the effects of certain foreign investments.

Net earnings for 1997 were $68.3 million, or $1.84 per basic share
($1.80 per diluted share), compared to $47.3 million, or $1.25 per
basic share ($1.24 per diluted share) for 1996, representing increases
of 47.2% (basic) and 45.2% (diluted) in earnings per share.

1996 vs. 1995:  Even though unit volume decreased 1.3%, net sales
increased 3.0% in 1996 from 1995. The decrease in unit volume was
caused by a shorter fiscal year in 1996 (1996 consisted of 52 weeks
versus 53 weeks in 1995). On a comparable-calendar basis, 1996 sales
volume was essentially unchanged from 1995. Net sales increased in 1996
from 1995 due to price increases; lower price promotion expenses; reduced 
freight charges as a result of direct shipments to certain markets; 
increased international and export sales, which generate higher revenue 
per barrel than domestic sales; the impact of CBC's interim agreement with 
Molson Breweries, which became effective in the fourth quarter, and the 
slight reductions in excise taxes related to the increase in export sales. 
Lower Zima and Artic Ice volumes and greater proportionate Keystone volumes 
negatively impacted net sales per barrel in 1996.

Gross profit in 1996 rose 5.2% to $614.4 million from 1995 due to the
3.0% increase in net sales, as discussed above, offset in part by a
1.9% increase in cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased due
to cost increases in paper and glass packaging materials; abandonments
of certain capital projects; cost increases for certain new contract-
brewing arrangements and cost increases for Japanese operations, which
began in the fourth quarter of 1995. The increase in cost of goods sold
was partially offset by the favorable impact of decreases in brewing
material costs; changes in brand mix (specifically, increases in Coors
Light volume offset in part by decreases in Zima volume and increases
in Keystone volume) and slightly favorable labor costs. Additionally, 1995 
gross profit included the cost of the Zima Gold termination and withdrawal.

Operating income increased 34.0% to $87.4 million in 1996 from 1995
primarily due to a 5.2% increase in gross profit discussed earlier; a
6.1% decrease in research and development expenses; offset partially by
a 13.5% increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses.
Marketing expenses were relatively unchanged from 1995. G&A expenses
increased due to continued investments in domestic and foreign sales
organizations; increases in officers' life insurance expenses;
increases in costs of operating distributorships (a distributorship was
acquired in 1995) and increases in administrative costs for certain
foreign operations. Research and development expenses decreased due to
the planned reduction in the number of capital projects in 1996.

Net non-operating expenses in 1996 declined 14.9% from 1995 because of
a 47.5% increase in net miscellaneous income offset in part by a 5.4%
increase in net interest expense. Increased royalties earned on certain
can-decorating technologies drove the increase in miscellaneous income.
Additionally, net interest expense increased due to interest incurred
on the Senior Notes and reductions in the amount of interest
capitalized on capital projects.

The Company's effective tax rate increased to 41.8% in 1996 from 41.6%
in 1995 primarily due to changes in cash surrender values of officers'
life insurance. Further, the 1996 effective tax rate exceeded the
statutory rate because of the effects of certain non-deductible
expenses and foreign investments.

Net earnings for 1996 were $47.3 million, or $1.25 per basic share
($1.24 per diluted share), compared to $33.9 million, or $0.89 per
basic and diluted share, for 1995, representing a 40.4% increase in
basic earnings per share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by
operating activities and external borrowings. As of December 28, 1997,
ACC had working capital of $158.0 million, and its net cash position
was $168.9 million compared to $110.9 million as of December 29, 1996,
and $32.4 million as of December 31, 1995. In addition to its cash
resources, ACC had short-term investments of $42.2 million at December
28, 1997, compared to $6.0 million at December 29, 1996. ACC also had
$47.1 million of marketable investments with maturities exceeding one
year at December 28, 1997, and no comparable investments at December
29, 1996. ACC had no marketable investments other than cash equivalents
at December 31, 1995. The Company believes that cash flows from
operations and short-term borrowings will be sufficient to meet its
ongoing operating requirements; scheduled principal and interest
payments on indebtedness; dividend payments; costs to make computer
software Year 2000 compliant and anticipated capital expenditures in
the range of $75 to $85 million for production equipment, information
systems, repairs and upkeep and environmental compliance.

Operating activities:  Net cash provided by operating activities was
$260.6 million for 1997, $189.6 million for 1996 and $92.4 million for
1995. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in
1997 compared to 1996 was attributable primarily to higher net income,
decreases in inventories and other assets and increases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by
increases in accounts and notes receivable. The decrease in inventories
primarily resulted from lower levels of packaging supplies inventories
on hand. The decrease in other assets is due to a reduction in other
supplies. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and
other liabilities relative to 1996 reflects accruals for incentive
compensation and increased payables for excise taxes. The increase in
accounts and notes receivable reflects higher sales volumes and higher
amounts due from container joint venture partners.

The 1996 increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to
decreases in inventories; moderate decreases in accounts payable and
accrued expenses and other liabilities (relative to significant
decreases in 1995) and decreases in accounts and notes receivable. The
decrease in inventories primarily resulted from a higher proportion of
shipments directly to distributors rather than shipments through to
satellite redistribution centers. The moderate decreases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, compared to 1995,
reflects the significant payment of obligations to various suppliers, including
advertising agencies, in 1995. Accounts and notes receivable declined because 
sales were lower during the last 12 to 16 days of 1996 than during the same 
period of 1995. CBC's credit terms are generally 12 to 16 days.

Investing activities:  During 1997, ACC spent $127.9 million on
investing activities compared to $51.4 million in 1996 and $118.5
million in 1995. The 1997 increase was due primarily to ACC's
investments in marketable securities with extended maturities that are
not considered cash equivalents. The net of purchases over sales of
these securities was $83.3 million in 1997. Capital expenditures
decreased to $60.4 million in 1997 from $65.1 million in 1996 and
$157.6 million in 1995. In 1997, capital expenditures focused on
enhancing packaging operations, while 1996 expenditures focused on
information systems and expansion of packaging capacity. In 1995,
capital expenditures focused on upgrades and expansion of Golden-based
facilities - particularly bottling capacity. Proceeds from property
sales were $3.3 million in 1997, compared to $8.1 million in 1996 and
$44.4 million in 1995. Proceeds from property sales in 1995 were
unusually high because of the sale of the power plant equipment and
support facilities for $22.0 million and the sale of certain bottleline
machinery and equipment under a sale-leaseback transaction, for $17.0 million.

Financing activities:  Net cash used in financing activities was $72.0
million during 1997 attributable to principal payments on ACC's medium-
term notes of $20.5 million, net purchases of Class B common stock for
$35.6 million and dividend payments of $20.5 million.

ACC spent $59.3 million on financing activities during 1996 due
primarily to principal payments on its medium-term notes of $38.0
million, purchases of Class B common stock for $3.0 million and
dividend payments of $19.0 million.

During 1995, the Company generated $31.0 million of cash from financing
activities due to the receipt of $100 million from a private placement
of Senior Notes, which was offset by principal payments on medium-term
notes of $44 million, purchases of Class B common shares of $9.9
million and dividend payments of $19.1 million.

Debt obligations:  As of December 28, 1997, ACC had $67.5 million
outstanding in medium-term notes. With cash on hand, the Company repaid
principal of $20.5 million and $38 million on these notes in 1997 and
1996, respectively. Principal payments of $44 million in 1995 were funded 
by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings. Fixed interest rates on 
these notes range from 8.63% to 9.05%. Aggregate annual maturities on 
outstanding notes are $27.5 million in 1998 and $40 million in 1999.

In the third quarter of 1995, ACC completed a $100-million private
placement of Senior Notes at fixed interest rates ranging from 6.76% to
6.95% per annum. The repayment schedule is $80 million in 2002 and $20 million
in 2005. The proceeds from this borrowing were used primarily to reduce debt
under the revolving line of credit and to repay principal on the medium-
term notes.

The Company's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 19.0% in 1997,
21.2% at the end of 1996 and 24.9% at the end of 1995.

Revolving line of credit:  In addition to the medium-term notes and the
Senior Notes, the Company has an unsecured, committed credit
arrangement totaling $200 million and as of December 28, 1997, had all
$200 million available. This line of credit has a five year term which
expires in 2002, with two optional one-year extensions. A facilities
fee is paid on the total amount of the committed credit. The only
restriction for withdrawal is a debt-to-total-capitalization covenant,
with which the Company was in compliance at year-end 1997.

CBC's distribution subsidiary in Japan has two revolving lines of
credit that it uses in normal operations. Each of these facilities
provides up to 500 million yen (approximately $4.0 million each) in
short-term financing. As of December 28, 1997, the approximate yen equivalent 
of $4.5 million was outstanding under these arrangements and included in 
Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Hedging activities:  As of December 28, 1997, hedging activities
consisted exclusively of hard currency forward contracts to directly
offset hard currency exposures. These irrevocable contracts reduced the
risk to financial position and results of operations of changes in the
underlying foreign exchange rate. Any variation in the exchange rate
accruing to the contract would be offset by a similar change in the
related obligation. Therefore, after execution of the contract,
variations in exchange rates would not impact the Company's financial
statements. ACC's hedging activities and hard currency exposures are
minimal. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculation or trading purposes.

Stock repurchase plan:  On November 13, 1997, the board of directors
authorized the extension of the Company's stock repurchase program
through 1998. The program authorizes repurchases of up to $40 million
of ACC's outstanding Class B common stock during 1998. Repurchases will
be financed by funds generated from operations or possibly from short-
term borrowings. The Company spent approximately $25 million in 1997 to
repurchase common stock, primarily in purchasing almost 1 million
shares of outstanding Class B common stock under the previously
approved stock repurchase program.

Investment in Jinro-Coors Brewing Company:  CBC invested approximately
$22 million for a 33% interest in Jinro-Coors Brewing Company (JCBC) in
1992. CBC has accounted for this investment under the cost basis of
accounting, given that CBC has not had the ability to exercise
significant influence over JCBC and that CBC's investment in JCBC has
been considered temporary. This investment included a put option that
was exercised by CBC in December 1997. The put option entitled CBC to
require Jinro Limited (the 67% owner of JCBC) to purchase CBC's investment 
at the greater of cost or market value (both measured in Korean Won).

Beginning in April 1997, Jinro Limited, a publicly-traded subsidiary of
Jinro Group, missed debt payments and began attempting to restructure.
In response to its financial difficulties and those of its subsidiaries
(including JCBC), Jinro Group has been working with its creditors and
the government to restructure its debts and has begun selling real
estate and merging and/or selling businesses. The financial
difficulties of JCBC and Jinro Limited, the guarantor of the put option
discussed above, called into question the recoverability of CBC's
investment in JCBC. Therefore, during the second quarter of 1997, CBC
fully reserved for its investment in JCBC. This reserve was classified
as a special charge in the accompanying statements of income.

CBC exercised its put option in December 1997. Since Jinro Limited's
obligation under the put is measured in Korean Won and given the
current significant devaluation of that currency, the full amount
received from Jinro Limited would be significantly less (approximately
half as of December 28, 1997) than the value of CBC's original
investment. Jinro Limited, which is operating under protection from its
creditors under the Korean composition law, has until June 1998 to
perform its obligation under the put option. Given Jinro Limited's current 
financial condition and the volatility of the Korean economy, CBC cannot 
predict whether Jinro Limited will be able to perform under this obligation.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include,
among others, statements concerning the Company's outlook for 1998;
overall and brand-specific volume trends; pricing trends and industry
forces; cost reduction strategies and their results; targeted goals for
return on invested capital; the Company's expectations for funding its
1998 capital expenditures and operations; the Company's expectations
for funding work on computer software to make it compliant with Year
2000; and other statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and
strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning 
matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements.

To improve its financial performance, the Company must grow premium
beverage volume, achieve modest price increases for its products and
reduce its overall cost structure. The most important factors that
could influence the achievement of these goals -- and cause actual results 
to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking 
statements -- include, but are not limited to, the following:

- - the inability of the Company and its distributors to develop and
execute effective marketing and sales strategies for Coors products;

- - the potential erosion on sales revenues through discounting or a
higher proportion of sales in value-packs;

- - a potential shift in consumer preferences toward lower-priced
products in response to price increases;

- - a potential shift in consumer preferences away from the premium light
beer category, including Coors Light;

- - the intensely competitive, slow-growth nature of the beer industry;

- - demographic trends and social attitudes that can reduce beer sales;

- - the continued growth in the popularity of imports and other specialty beers;

- - increases in the cost of aluminum, paper packaging and other raw materials;

- - the Company's inability to reduce manufacturing, freight and overhead
costs to more competitive levels;

- - changes in significant laws and government regulations affecting
environmental compliance and income taxes;

- - inability to achieve targeted improvements in CBC's distribution system;

- - the imposition of excise or other taxes;

- - restrictions on advertising (e.g., media, outdoor ads or sponsorships);

- - labor issues, including union activities that required a substantial
increase in cost of goods sold or led to a strike, impairing
production and decreasing sales;

- - significant increases in federal, state or local beer or other excise taxes;

- - increases in rail transportation rates or interruptions of rail service;

- - potential impact of industry consolidation;

- - risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries, 
including those related to foreign regulatory requirements; exchange rate
fluctuations and local political, social and economic factors; and

- - risk that computer systems of the Company's significant suppliers and
customers may not be Year 2000 compliant.

These and other risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are
discussed in greater detail in this report and in the Company's other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

OUTLOOK FOR 1998

Volume gains are expected to increase net sales in 1998; however, the
pricing environment is expected to be extremely competitive, restraining 
expectations of net sales per barrel. Also, increased value-pack activity 
may have an unfavorable impact on top-line performance due to lower margins.

Income from the Company's Canadian business is expected to be 25% to
30% lower per barrel in 1998 than in 1997, based on current sales
trends and 1998 plans for marketing investments. Revenue received under
the Company's interim agreement with Molson Breweries, which expired at
year-end 1997, provided higher earnings per barrel than those expected
as a result of the new partnership with Molson Company and Carling. On
the other hand, the partners of Coors Canada see considerable growth
potential for Coors products in Canada in the future.

For fiscal year 1998, raw material costs are expected to be up
slightly, but fixed costs and freight costs are expected to be down
slightly. This outlook could change if aluminum or paper cost trends
change during the first nine months of 1998. CBC continues to pursue
improvements in its operations and technology functions to achieve cost
reductions over time.

Advertising and other general and administrative costs are expected to
increase but at a lower rate than in 1997. Management continues to
monitor CBC's market opportunities and to invest behind its brands and
sales efforts accordingly. Incremental sales and marketing spending
will be determined on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis.

See the item titled Year 2000 under CONTINGENCIES of this section for a
discussion of the expected financial impact of this issue.

Total net interest expense is expected to be lower in 1998 based on
CBC's more favorable cash position and its lower outstanding debt
relative to its 1997 financial position. Net interest expense could be
less favorable than expected if the Company decides to invest a
substantial portion of its cash balances. Additional outstanding common
stock may be repurchased in 1998 as approved by the ACC board of
directors in November 1997.

The effective tax rate for 1998 is not expected to differ significantly
from the 1997 effective tax rate applied to income excluding special
items. The level and mix of pretax income for 1998 could affect the
actual rate for the year.

In 1998, CBC has planned capital expenditures (including contributions
to its container joint ventures for capital improvements, which will be
recorded on the books of the joint venture) in the range of $75 to $85
million. In addition to CBC's 1998 planned capital expenditures,
incremental strategic investments will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

CONTINGENCIES

Environmental:  The Company was one of numerous parties named by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a "potentially responsible
party" (PRP) for the Lowry site, a legally permitted landfill owned by
the City and County of Denver. In 1990, the Company recorded a special
pretax charge of $30 million for potential cleanup costs of the site.

The City and County of Denver; Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. and
Chemical Waste Management, Inc. brought litigation in 1991 in U.S.
District Court against the Company and 37 other PRPs to determine the
allocation of costs of Lowry site remediation. In 1993, the Court
approved a settlement agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs,
resolving the Company's liabilities for the site. The Company agreed to
initial payments based on an assumed present value of $120 million in
total site remediation costs. Further, the Company agreed to pay a
specified share of costs if total remediation costs exceeded this
amount. The Company remitted its agreed share of $30 million, based on
the $120 million assumption, to a trust for payment of site
remediation, operating and maintenance costs.

The City and County of Denver; Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. and
Chemical Waste Management, Inc. are expected to implement site
remediation. The EPA's projected costs to meet the announced
remediation objectives and requirements are currently below the $120
million assumption used for ACC's settlement. The Company has no reason
to believe that total remediation costs will result in additional
liability to the Company.

From time to time, ACC also is notified that it is or may be a PRP
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws for the cleanup of other
sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the
environment. The Company cannot predict with certainty the total costs
of cleanup, its share of the total cost or the extent to which
contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time
necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage. However,
based on investigations to date, the Company believes that any liability 
would be immaterial to its financial position and results of operations for 
these sites. There can be no certainty, however, that the Company will not 
be named as a PRP at additional CERCLA sites in the future, or that the 
costs associated with those additional sites will not be material.

While it is impossible to predict the Company's eventual aggregate cost
for environmental and related matters, management believes that any
payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of
time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to the
Company's results of operations or its financial or competitive
position. The Company believes adequate disclosures have been provided
for losses that are reasonably possible. Further, as the Company continues 
to focus on resource conservation, waste reduction and pollution prevention, 
it believes that potential future liabilities will be reduced.

Year 2000:  As the Year 2000 approaches, ACC recognizes the need to
ensure its  operations will not be adversely impacted by Year 2000
software failures. The Company is addressing this issue to ensure the
availability and integrity of its financial systems and the reliability
of its operational systems. ACC has established processes for
evaluating and managing the risks and costs associated with this
problem. The Company has and will continue to make certain investments
in its software systems and applications to ensure that it is Year 2000
compliant. The financial impact to ACC of Year 2000 remediation costs
is anticipated to be in the range of $10 to $15 million in each of 1998
and 1999. In addition, ACC is working with its suppliers and customers
to ensure their compliance with Year 2000 issues in order to avoid any
interruptions in its business. While ACC does not at this time
anticipate significant problems with suppliers and customers, it is
developing contingency plans with these third parties due to the
possibility of compliance issues.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued
Statement of Position 98-1 "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" (SOP 98-1). SOP 98-1
requires that specified costs incurred in developing or obtaining
internal-use software, as defined by SOP 98-1, be capitalized once
certain criteria have been met and amortized in a systematic and
rational manner over the software's estimated useful life. SOP 98-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998, and
stipulates that costs incurred prior to initial application of the
statement not be adjusted according to the statement's provisions.
Adoption of SOP 98-1 is not expected to have a significant impact on
the Company's financial position or results of operations.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Adolph Coors Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Adolph Coors Company and its subsidiaries at December 28,
1997, and December 29, 1996, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 28, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.

              ADOLPH COORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    
NOTE 1:
    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation:  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Adolph Coors Company (ACC),
its principal subsidiary, Coors Brewing Company (CBC), and the
majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
of both ACC and CBC (collectively referred to as "the Company").
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for the
Company's 50% or less owned affiliates over which the Company has
the ability to exercise significant influence (see Note 10). The
Company has other investments which are accounted for at cost.

Nature of operations:  The Company is a multinational brewer and
marketer of beer and other malt-based beverages. The vast
majority of the Company's volume is sold in the United States to
independent wholesalers. The Company's international volume is
produced, marketed and distributed under varying business arrangements 
including export, direct investment, joint ventures and licensing.

Fiscal year:  The fiscal year of the Company is a 52- or 53-week
period ending on the last Sunday in December. Fiscal years for
the financial statements included herein ended December 28, 1997,
a 52-week period; December 29, 1996, a 52-week period and
December 31, 1995, a 53-week period.

Investments in marketable securities:  ACC invests excess cash on
hand in interest-bearing debt securities. At December 28, 1997,
$42.2 million of these securities were classified as current
assets and $47.1 million were classified with longer term assets,
as their maturities exceeded one year. All of these securities
were considered to be available-for-sale. The fair value of these
securities at December 28, 1997, approximated their amortized cost.

Concentration of credit risk:  The majority of the accounts
receivable balances are from malt beverage distributors. The
Company secures substantially all of this credit risk with
purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds,
personal guarantees and/or letters of credit.

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method for substantially all inventories.

Current cost, as determined principally on the first-in, first-
out method, exceeded LIFO cost by $43.4 million and $43.1 million
at December 28, 1997, and December 29, 1996, respectively.

Properties:  Land, buildings and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method
over the following estimated useful lives:  buildings and
improvements, 10 to 45 years; and machinery and equipment, 3 to
20 years. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for
income tax purposes. Expenditures for new facilities and
improvements that substantially extend the capacity or useful
life of an asset are capitalized. Start-up costs associated with
manufacturing facilities, but not related to construction, are expensed 
as incurred. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Hedging transactions:  The Company periodically enters into short-
term forward contracts for foreign currency to hedge its exposure
to exchange rate fluctuations. The gains and losses on these
contracts are deferred and recognized in income when realized.

As of December 28, 1997, hedging activities consisted exclusively
of hard currency forward contracts to directly offset hard
currency exposures. These irrevocable contracts reduced the risk
to financial position and results of operations of changes in the
underlying foreign exchange rate. Any variation in the exchange
rate accruing to the contract would be offset by a similar change
in the related obligation. Therefore, after the execution of the
contract, variations in exchange rates would not impact the
Company's financial statements. The Company's hedging activities
and hard currency exposures are minimal. The Company does not enter into 
derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes.

Excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired:  The
excess of cost over the net assets of businesses acquired in
transactions accounted for as purchases is being amortized on a
straight-line basis, generally over a 40-year period.

Impairment policy:  The Company periodically evaluates its assets
to assess their recoverability from future operations using
undiscounted cash flows. Impairment would be recognized in
operations if permanent diminution in value occurs.

Advertising:  Advertising costs, included in marketing, general
and administrative, are expensed when the advertising first takes
place. Advertising expense was $360.0 million, $331.9 million and
$330.4 million for years 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company 
had $9.6 million and $10.9 million of prepaid advertising production costs 
reported as assets at December 28, 1997, and December 29, 1996, respectively.

Research and development:  Research and project development
costs, included in marketing, general and administrative, are
expensed as incurred. These costs totaled $14.6 million, $15.3
million and $16.3 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Environmental expenditures:  Environmental expenditures that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as
appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or
future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded
when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are
probable and the costs can be estimated reasonably.

Statement of Cash Flows:  The Company defines cash equivalents as
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or
less. The fair value of these investments approximates their
carrying value. The Company's 1995 investment in the Rocky
Mountain Bottle Company was a $16.2 million non-cash transaction
that is not reflected as an investing activity in the Statement
of Cash Flows. During 1997, ACC issued $0.8 million in restricted
common stock under its management incentive compensation plan.
Income taxes paid were $66.8 million in 1997, $13.2 million in
1996 and $15.8 million in 1995.

Use of estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:  Certain reclassifications have been made to
the 1996 and 1995 financial statements to conform with the 1997 presentation.

NOTE 2:

Properties

The cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation,
depletion and amortization consists of the following:
                                                 As of
                                 December 28,          December 29,
                                        1997                  1996

In March 1994, CBC, through its subsidiary Coors Brewing Iberica,
S.A. (Coors Iberica), purchased a 500,000-hectoliter brewery in
Zaragoza, Spain. During 1997, Coors Iberica addressed certain
capacity issues at its brewery, as well as certain employment
matters. Coors Iberica negotiated severance terms with labor
unions during the second quarter of 1997, which prompted CBC
management to update its evaluation of the recoverability of
Coors Iberica's long-lived assets and related goodwill. Certain
of these assets were deemed impaired in light of expected future,
undiscounted cash flows. During the second quarter of 1997, CBC
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10.6 million and
severance costs of approximately $3.8 million, which have been
classified as special charges in the accompanying statements of
income. The impairment charge represented a reduction of the
carrying amounts of the impaired assets to their estimated fair
market values, which were determined with the aid of an
independent, third-party appraisal.

Interest incurred, capitalized, expensed and paid was as follows:

                                   For the years ended
                        December 28,   December 29,    December 31,

equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements
accounted for as operating leases. At December 28, 1997, the
minimum aggregate rental commitment under all non-cancelable
leases was (in thousands):  1998, $5,403; 1999, $4,578; 2000,
$3,124; 2001, $2,353 and $15,021 for years thereafter. Total rent

Fair values were determined using discounted cash flows at
current interest rates for similar borrowings.

As of December 28, 1997, the Company had outstanding $67.5
million of unsecured medium-term notes. Interest is due
semiannually in April and October at fixed interest rates ranging
from 8.63% to 9.05% per annum. Aggregate annual maturities for
the notes issued are $27.5 million in 1998 and $40 million in 1999.

On July 14, 1995, the Company completed a $100-million private
placement of unsecured Senior Notes at fixed interest rates
ranging from 6.76% to 6.95% per annum. Interest on the notes is
due semiannually in January and July. The Notes are payable as
follows:  $80 million in 2002 and $20 million in 2005.

The Company is obligated to pay the principal, interest and
premium, if any, on the $5 million, City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado
Industrial Development Bonds (Adolph Coors Company Project)
Series 1993. The bonds mature in 2013 and are secured by a letter
of credit. They are currently variable rate securities with
interest payable on the first of March, June, September and
December. The interest rate on December 28, 1997 was 4.3%.

The Company has an unsecured, committed credit arrangement
totaling $200 million and as of December 28, 1997, had all $200
million available. This line of credit has a five year term which
expires in 2002, with two optional one-year extensions. A facilities 
fee is paid on the total amount of the committed credit. The only 
restriction for withdrawal is a debt-to-total-capitalization covenant, 
with which the Company was in compliance at year-end 1997.

CBC's distribution subsidiary in Japan has two revolving lines of
credit that it utilizes in its normal operations. Each of these
facilities provides up to 500 million yen (approximately $4.0
million each) in short-term financing. As of December 28, 1997,
the approximate yen equivalent of $4.5 million was outstanding
under these arrangements and included in Accrued expenses and
other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

NOTE 5:

      Net non-current deferred tax liabilities  $ 76,219       $ 76,083

The deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance, 
because management believes it is more likely than not that such benefits 
will not be fully realized.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its examination
of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1992. The IRS
currently is examining the federal income tax returns for fiscal
years 1993 through 1995. In the opinion of management, adequate
accruals have been provided for all income tax matters and related interest.

The Company and ACX Technologies, Inc. (ACX) are parties to a tax
sharing agreement that provides for, among other things, the treatment 
of tax matters for periods prior to the distribution of ACX stock at the 
end of 1992 and the assignment of responsibility for adjustments as a 
result of audits by taxing authorities and is designed to preserve the 
status of the distribution as tax-free (see Note 12).

NOTE 6:

Stock Option, Restricted Stock Award and Employee Award Plans

At December 28, 1997, the Company had four stock-based
compensation plans, which are described in greater detail below.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, as the
exercise prices upon grant are equal to quoted market values, no
compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option
portion of the plans. Had compensation cost been determined for
the Company's stock option portion of the plans based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent
with the alternative method set forth under FASB Statement No.
123, the Company's net income and earnings per share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

                                                1997       1996       1995

  diluted                      Pro forma      $   2.05   $   1.12  $   1.09

The weighted-average fair value of options
granted under the 1990 Equity Incentive Plan
during the year is:                           $   8.78   $   7.21  $   6.21

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average 
assumptions used for grants in 1997 and 1996, respectively:  dividend yield 
of 2.47% and 2.535%; expected volatility of 36.06% and 26.7%, risk-free 
interest rates of 6.52% and 5.74% for the 1990 Plan options and expected 
lives of 10  years for both years.

1983 Plan:  The 1983 non-qualified Adolph Coors Company Stock
Option Plan, as amended (the 1983 Plan) provides for options to
be granted at the discretion of the board of directors. These
options expire 10 years from date of grant. No options have been
granted under this plan since 1989. At this time, the board of
directors has decided not to grant additional options under this plan.

A summary of the status of the Company's 1983 Plan as of December
28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995, and changes

Common stock available for options under the 1983 Plan as of
December 28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995 was
716,886 shares, 712,998 shares and 694,090 shares, respectively.

1990 Plan:  The 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan) that
became effective January 1, 1990, as amended, provides for two
types of grants:  stock options and restricted stock awards. The
stock options have a term of 10 years with exercise prices equal
to fair market value on the day of the grant. For grants during
1997, one-third of the stock option grant vests in each of the
three successive years after the date of grant. For grants during
1994 through 1996, stock options vested at 10% for each $1 increase in 
fair market value of ACC stock from date of grant, with a one-year holding 
period, or vest 100% after nine years. Once a portion has vested, it is not 
forfeited even if the fair market value drops.

Common stock available for options under the 1990 EI Plan as of
December 28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995 was
4,675,195 shares, 3,105,844 shares and 3,650,483 shares, respectively.

In 1997, 40,201 shares of restricted stock were issued under the
1990 EI Plan. Vesting in the restricted stock award is one year
from the date of grant. The compensation cost associated with
these awards was immaterial.

In 1996, 45,390 shares of restricted stock were issued under the
1990 EI Plan. Vesting in the restricted stock awards is over a
three-year period from the date of grant. The compensation cost
associated with these awards is amortized to expense over the
vesting period. Compensation cost associated with these awards
was immaterial in 1997 and 1996.

1991 Plan:  In 1991, the Company adopted the Equity Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (EC Plan). The EC Plan provides
for two grants of the Company's stock:  the first grant is
automatic and equals 20% of the director's annual retainer, and
the second grant is elective and covers all or any portion of the
balance of the retainer. A director may elect to receive his
remaining 80% retainer in cash, restricted stock or any
combination of the two. Grants of stock vest after completion of
the director's annual term. The compensation cost associated with
the EC Plan is amortized over the director's term. Compensation cost 
associated with this plan was immaterial in 1997 and 1996. Common stock 
reserved for this plan as of December 28, 1997, was 47,810 shares.

1995 Supplemental Compensation Plan:  In 1995, the Company
adopted a supplemental compensation plan that covers
substantially all its employees. Under the plan, management is
allowed to recognize employee achievements through awards of
Coors Stock Units (CSUs) or cash. CSUs are a measurement
component equal to the fair market value of the Company's Class B
common stock. CSUs have a one-year holding period after which the
recipient may redeem the CSUs for cash, or, if the holder has 100
or more CSUs, shares of the Company's Class B common stock. Prior
to 1997, the CSUs had a six-month holding period. Awards under
the plan in 1997 and 1996 were immaterial.

Common stock available under this plan as of December 28, 1997,
was 83,707 shares.

NOTE 7:

Employee Retirement Plans

The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans for
the majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of
service and average base compensation levels over a period of
years. Plan assets consist primarily of equity, interest-bearing
investments and real estate. The Company's funding policy is to
contribute annually not less than the ERISA minimum funding
standards, nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted
for federal income tax purposes. Total expense for all these
plans was $14.1 million in 1997, $24.8 million in 1996 and $22.7
million in 1995. These amounts include the Company's matching for
the savings and investment (thrift) plan of $5.8 million in 1997
and $5.7 million each for 1996 and 1995. The decrease in 1997
pension expense versus 1996 was caused primarily by an
improvement in the funded position of the Coors Retirement Plan
and an increase in the discount rate (settlement rate) used to
compute 1997 pension cost to 7.75% from the rate used for 1996
pension cost of 7.25%. The increase in 1996 pension expense
versus 1995 was caused primarily by a decrease in the 1996
discount rate (settlement rate) to 7.25% from the 1995 rate of 8.5%.

Note that the settlement rates shown in the table on the following 
page were selected for use at the end of each of the years shown. 
Actuaries calculate pension expense annually based on data available at 
the beginning of each year, which includes the settlement rate selected 
and disclosed at the end of the previous year.

NOTE 8:

Non-Pension Postretirement Benefits

The Company has postretirement plans that provide medical
benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents.
The plans are not funded.

The obligation under these plans was determined by the
application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans,
together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost
trend rates ranging ratably from 9.0% in 1997 to 4.5% in the year
2007. The effect of an annual 1% increase in trend rates would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $3.5 million and $3.2 million in 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The effect of a 1% increase in trend rates also
would have increased the ongoing annual cost by $0.5 million and
$0.6 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The discount rate
used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
was 7.25% and 7.75% at December 28, 1997, and December 29, 1996, respectively.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following:

Effective November 29, 1995, changes were made to postretirement
life insurance and medical benefits which resulted in a
curtailment gain of $3.3 million and $18.6 million in 1996 and
1995, respectively. The 1996 decrease in plan expense resulted
principally from the curtailment of these benefits. The 1997
decrease in expense was a result of an increase in the discount
rate used to 7.75% in 1997 from 7.25% in 1996.

The status of the postretirement benefit plan was as follows:

NOTE 9:

Special (Credits) Charges

The annual results for 1997 included a pretax net special credit
of $31.5 million, which resulted in after tax income of $0.37 per
basic share ($0.36 per diluted share). First quarter results
included a $1.0-million pretax charge for Molson Breweries of
Canada Limited (Molson) legal proceedings. Second quarter results
included a $71.5-million special credit relating to a payment
from Molson to settle legal disputes with the Company, less
approximately $2.2 million in related legal expenses. Also in the
second quarter, CBC recorded a $22.4-million reserve related to
the recoverability of its investment in Jinro-Coors Brewing
Company (JCBC) of Korea (Note 10), as well as a $14.4-million
charge related to CBC's brewery in Zaragoza, Spain (Note 2), for the
impairment of certain long-lived assets and goodwill and for
severance costs for a limited workforce reduction.

The annual results for 1996 included a pretax net special charge
of $6.3 million which resulted in after tax expense of $0.11 per
basic share ($0.10 per diluted share). Second quarter results included a 
$5.2-million pretax charge for the ongoing Molson legal proceedings and 
severance costs for restructuring the Company's engineering and construction 
operations. Results of the third quarter included a $6.7-million pretax 
credit for underpaid past royalties and interest from Molson (net of related 
legal expenses) and income from the continuing effect of changes made in 
payroll-related practices during 1995. Fourth quarter results included a 
$7.9-million pretax charge for Molson-related legal expenses, partially 
offset by underpaid past royalties from Molson and the continuing effect 
of changes made in payroll-related practices during 1995.

Fourth quarter results for 1995 included a pretax net special
credit of $15.2 million which resulted in after tax income of
$0.24 per basic and diluted share. The net credit was primarily
the result of a gain for the curtailment of certain
postretirement benefits other than pensions (see Note 8).
Offsetting a portion of this curtailment gain are severance
charges for limited reductions of the Company's work force.

NOTE 10:

Investments

Equity method investments:  The Company has 50% or less owned
investments in affiliates that are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. These investments aggregated $51.7 million
and $47.6 million at December 28, 1997, and December 29, 1996,
respectively. These investment amounts are included in other
assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Summarized condensed balance sheet and income statement
information for the Company's equity method investments are as follows:

In 1995, CBC and Anchor Glass Container Corporation (Anchor)
formed a 50/50 joint venture to produce glass bottles at the CBC
glass manufacturing facility for sale to CBC and outside
customers. In 1996, Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens)
purchased certain Anchor assets and assumed Anchor's role in the
partnership. The agreement has an initial term of 10 years and
can be extended for additional two-year periods. Under the terms
of the agreement, CBC agreed to contribute machinery, equipment
and certain personal property with an approximate net book value
of $16.2 million and Owens agreed to contribute technology and
capital, which would be used to modernize and expand the capacity
of the plant. Also under the agreement, CBC agreed to reimburse
certain annual operating costs of the facility and to purchase an
annual quantity of bottles, which together represent a 1998 commitment of 
approximately $59 million. The expenditures under this agreement in 1997, 
1996 and 1995 were approximately $59 million, $54 million and $23 million, 
respectively. Additionally, the companies entered into another 10-year 
agreement that made Owens a long-term, preferred supplier for CBC, 
satisfying 100% of CBC's other glass requirements.

In 1994, CBC and American National Can Company (ANC) formed a
50/50 joint venture to produce beverage cans and ends at CBC
manufacturing facilities for sale to CBC and outside customers.
The agreement has an initial term of seven years and can be
extended for two additional three-year periods. Additionally, the
agreement requires CBC to purchase 100% of its can and end needs
from the joint venture at contracted unit prices and to pay an
annual fee for certain operating costs. The aggregate amount paid
to the joint venture for cans and ends in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was
approximately $227 million, $217 million and $238 million,
respectively. The estimated cost in 1998 under this agreement for
cans and ends is $231 million. Additionally, during 1997 CBC
received a $12.5-million distribution from this joint venture.

Cost investments:  Included in other assets is $47.1 million of
investments in debt securities with maturities greater than one
year. The fair value of these investments approximates their
amortized cost, and they are considered to be available-for-sale.

CBC invested approximately $22 million in JCBC in 1992 for a 33%
interest. CBC has accounted for the investment under the cost
basis of accounting, given that CBC has not had the ability to
exercise significant influence over JCBC and that CBC's
investment in JCBC has been considered temporary. This investment
included a put option which, as discussed below, was exercised by
CBC in December 1997. The put option entitled CBC to require
Jinro Limited (the 67% owner of JCBC) to purchase CBC's investment at 
the greater of cost or market value (both measured in Korean Won).

Beginning in April 1997, Jinro Limited, a publicly-traded
subsidiary of Jinro Group, missed debt payments and began
attempting to restructure. In response to its financial
difficulties and those of its subsidiaries (including JCBC),
Jinro Group has been working with its creditors and the Korean
government to restructure its debts and has begun selling real
estate and merging and/or selling businesses. The financial
difficulties of JCBC and Jinro Limited, the guarantor of the put
option discussed above, called into question the recoverability
of CBC's investment in JCBC. Therefore, during the second quarter of 1997, 
CBC fully reserved for its investment in JCBC. This reserve was classified 
as a special charge in the accompanying statements of income.

CBC exercised its put option in December 1997. Since Jinro
Limited's obligation under the put is measured in Korean Won and
given the current significant devaluation of that currency, the
full amount received from Jinro Limited would be significantly
less (by approximately half as of December 28, 1997) than the
value of CBC's original investment. Jinro Limited, which is
operating under protection from its creditors under the Korean
composition law, has until June 1998 to perform its obligation
under the put option. Given Jinro Limited's current financial
condition and the volatility of the Korean economy, CBC cannot
predict whether Jinro Limited will be able to perform under this obligation.

ACX:  CBC is a limited partner in a partnership in which a
subsidiary of ACX is the general partner. The partnership owns,
develops, operates and sells certain real estate previously owned
directly by CBC or ACC. Each partner is obligated to make
additional contributions of up to $500,000 upon call of the
general partner. Distributions are allocated equally between the
partners until CBC recovers its investment and thereafter 80% to
the general partner and 20% to CBC. Currently distributions are
still being split equally between the partners.

Colorado Baseball Partnership:  In 1991, CBC entered into an
agreement with Colorado Baseball Partnership 1993, Ltd. for an
equity investment and multiyear signage and advertising package.
This commitment, totaling approximately $30 million, was
finalized upon the awarding of a National League baseball
franchise to Colorado in 1991. The initial investment as a
limited partner has been paid. The carrying value of this investment 
approximates its fair value at December 28, 1997, and December 28, 1996. 
The recognition of liability under the multiyear signage and advertising 
package began in 1995 with the opening of Coors Field.

At December 28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995, 25,000,000 
shares of $1 par value preferred stock were authorized but unissued.

On December 20, 1996, the board of directors authorized the
repurchase during 1997 of up to $40 million of ACC's outstanding
Class B common stock on the open market. During 1997, the Company
repurchased 969,500 shares for approximately $24.9 million under
this stock repurchase program. In November 1997, the board of
directors authorized repurchases of up to $40 million of stock
during 1998. As of March 20, 1998, ACC had repurchased 647,000
shares for approximately $20.5 million under this program.

Also during 1997, the Company purchased shares under the right-of-
first-refusal provision of its stock option plans and purchased
shares from one of its directors and various other sources.

Earnings per share:  ACC adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS 128),
effective with year-end 1997 reporting. SFAS 128 requires
mandatory presentation of both a basic and diluted earnings per
share. All per share amounts have been restated to comply
with the requirements of SFAS 128. Basic and diluted net income
per common share were arrived at using the calculations outlined below:

the treasury stock method, assuming the Company was to purchase
common shares with the proceeds from stock option exercises.

NOTE 12:

Commitments and Contingencies

Insurance:  It is the Company's policy to act as a self-insurer
for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of employee
health insurance programs and general liability contract
deductibles. During 1997, the Company fully insured future risks
for workers' compensation and long-term disability, but maintains
a self-insured position for claims incurred prior to the
inception of the insurance coverage.

In 1991, the Company became aware that Mutual Benefit Life
Insurance Company (MBLIC) had been placed under the control of
the State of New Jersey. The Company is a holder of several life
insurance policies and annuities through MBLIC. The cash
surrender value under these policies is approximately $7.5
million. Policyholders have been notified that all claims,
benefits and annuity payments will continue to be paid in full;
however, at this time, policyholders are unable to redeem the
full value of their policies for cash. A moratorium charge would
be applied to policies that are redeemed.

Letters of credit:  As of December 28, 1997, the Company has
approximately $17 million outstanding in letters of credit with
certain financial institutions. These letters generally expire
within 12 months from the dates of issuance, which range from
March 1998 to October 1998. These letters of credit are being
maintained as security for performance on certain insurance
policies, operations of underground storage tanks, as parent guarantees 
for bank financing and overdraft protection of a foreign subsidiary and 
payments of liquor and duty taxes and energy billings.

Power supplies:  In 1995, Coors Energy Company (CEC), a subsidiary of 
CBC, sold a portion of its coal reserves to Bowie Resources Ltd. (Bowie). 
CEC also entered into a 10-year agreement to purchase 100% of the brewery's 
coal requirements from Bowie. The coal then is sold to Trigen-Nations 
Energy Corporation, L.L.L.P. (Trigen).

In September 1995, CBC concluded the sale of its power plant and
support facilities to Trigen. In conjunction with this sale, CBC
agreed to purchase the electricity and steam needed to operate
the brewery's Golden facilities. CBC's financial commitment under
this agreement is divided between a fixed, non-cancelable cost of
approximately $12.5 million for 1998, which adjusts annually for
inflation, and a variable cost, which is generally based on fuel
cost and CBC's electricity and steam use.

ACX:  At the end of 1992, the Company distributed to its
shareholders the common stock of ACX. ACX was formed in 1992 to
own the ceramics, aluminum, packaging and technology-based
development businesses which were then owned by ACC. William K.
Coors, a director of both ACC and ACX during 1997, and Peter H.
Coors are trustees of one or more family trusts that collectively
own all of ACC's voting stock and approximately 47% of ACX's
common stock. Joseph Coors, a director of ACC, resigned as
director of ACX in July 1996. ACC and ACX or their subsidiaries
have certain business relationships and have engaged, or proposed
to engage, in certain transactions with one another, as described below.

When ACX was spun off in 1992, CBC entered into market-based,
long-term supply agreements with certain ACX subsidiaries to
provide CBC packaging, aluminum and starch products. Under the
packaging supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase all of its
paperboard (including composite packages, labels and certain can
wrappers) from an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997,
this contract was modified and extended until at least 1999. In
early 1997, ACX's aluminum manufacturing business was sold to a
third party. The aluminum contracts were canceled in 1995. Since
late 1994, ANC has been the purchasing agent for the joint
venture between ANC and CBC and has ordered limited quantities of
can, end and tab stock from the now-former ACX subsidiary.
Additionally, ANC purchased a small quantity of tab stock from
this subsidiary for the joint venture in early 1997. Under the
starch supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase 100 million
pounds of refined corn starch annually from an ACX subsidiary
through 1997. In early 1997, this agreement was renegotiated, at
slightly higher rates, and extended through 1999. CBC's total
purchases under these agreements in 1997 were approximately $118
million. Purchases in 1998 under the packaging and starch supply
agreements are estimated to be approximately $120 million.

Environmental:  In 1991, the City and County of Denver, Waste
Management of Colorado, Inc. and Chemical Waste Management, Inc.
brought litigation in U.S. District Court against the Company and
37 other "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) to determine
the allocation of costs of Lowry site remediation. In 1993, the
Court approved a settlement agreement between the Company and the
plaintiffs, resolving the Company's liabilities for the site. The
Company agreed to initial payments based on an assumed present
value of $120 million in total site remediation costs. Further,
the Company agreed to pay a specified share of costs if total
remediation costs exceeded this amount. The Company remitted its
agreed share, based on the $120 million assumption, to a trust
for payment of site remediation, operating and maintenance costs.
None of these payments was material to the Company's results of
operations or financial position.

The City and County of Denver, Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.
and Chemical Waste Management, Inc. have implemented site
remediation. The Environmental Protection Agency's projected
costs to meet the announced remediation objectives and
requirements are currently below the $120 million assumption used
for ACC's settlement. The Company has no reason to believe that total 
remediation costs will result in additional liability to the Company.

Litigation:  The Company also is named as defendant in various
actions and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
In all of these cases, the Company is denying the allegations and
is vigorously defending itself against them and, in some
instances, has filed counterclaims. Although the eventual outcome
of the various lawsuits cannot be predicted, it is management's opinion 
that these suits will not result in liabilities that would materially 
affect the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Restructuring liability:  At December 28, 1997, the Company had a
$3.4 million liability related to personnel accruals as a result
of a restructuring of operations that occurred in 1993. These
accruals relate to obligations under deferred compensation
arrangements and post-retirement benefits other than pensions.

Labor:  Approximately 7% of the Company's work force, located
principally at the Memphis brewing and packaging facility, is
represented by a labor union with whom the Company engages in
collective bargaining. A labor contract prohibiting strikes took
effect in early 1997 and extends to the year 2001.

Rail transportation:  The Company relies heavily upon rail
transportation to ship approximately half of its products to
satellite redistribution centers and to distributors throughout
the country. A major disruption in the railroad industry would
impact CBC significantly. However, the risk of such a disruption
at the current time appears to be low.

Year 2000 (unaudited):  As the Year 2000 approaches, ACC
recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be
adversely impacted by Year 2000 software failures. The Company is
addressing this issue to ensure the availability and integrity of
its financial systems and the reliability of its operational
systems. ACC has established processes for evaluating and
managing the risks and costs associated with this problem. The
Company has and will continue to make certain investments in its
software systems and applications to ensure that it is Year 2000
compliant. The financial impact to ACC of Year 2000 remediation
costs is anticipated to be in the range of $10 to $15 million in
each of 1998 and 1999. In addition, ACC is working with its
suppliers and customers to ensure their compliance with Year 2000
issues in order to avoid any interruptions in its business. While
ACC does not at this time anticipate significant problems with
suppliers and customers, it is developing contingency plans with
these third parties due to the possibility of compliance issues.

(a) Amounts awarded under the Management Incentive Compensation Program.

(b) In 1997, L. Don Brown received perquisites including moving
and relocation expenses of $81,691. In 1996, none of the named
executives received perquisites in excess of the lesser of
$50,000 or 10% of salary plus bonus. In 1995, Timothy V. Wolf
received perquisites including moving and relocation expenses of $293,450.

(c) In 1996, 45,390 shares of restricted stock were granted to L.
Don Brown. L. Don Brown's restricted stock award has a three-year
vesting period from the date of grant and is based on continuous
service during the vesting period. Dividends are paid to the
holder of the grant during the vesting period. The value as of
December 28, 1997 was $1,418,438. Restricted stock granted in
1993 to Peter H. Coors and W. Leo Kiely III vested in 1996.

No restricted stock grants were made in 1997 or 1995 to any of
the other named executives.

(d) See discussion under Item 11, Part II, for options issued in 1997.

(e) The amounts shown in this column are attributable to the
officer life insurance other than group life, 401(k) plans and
the excess of fair market value over option price for stock
options exercised in 1997.

Of the named executives, Peter H. Coors receives officer life
insurance provided by the Company until retirement. At the time
of retirement, the  officer's life insurance program terminates
and a salary continuation agreement becomes effective. The
officer's life insurance provides six times the executive base
salary until retirement, at which time the Company becomes the
beneficiary. The Company provides term life insurance for W. Leo
Kiely III, L. Don Brown and Timothy V. Wolf. The officer's life
insurance provides six times the executive base salary until
retirement when the benefit terminates. The 1997 annual benefit
for each executive for both programs was: Peter H. Coors -
$7,299; W. Leo Kiely III - $4,642; L. Don Brown - $4,382 and
Timothy V. Wolf - $2,428.

The Company's 50% match on the first 6% of salary contributed by
the officer to ACC's qualified 401(k) plan was $4,750 for Peter
H. Coors; $4,750 for W. Leo Kiely III; $4,750 for L. Don Brown
and $4,750 for Timothy V. Wolf. Peter H. Coors and Timothy V.
Wolf exercised stock options in 1997. See discussion in Item 11,
Part III for stock option exercises in 1997.

In response to Code Section 162 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993, the Company appointed a special compensation committee to
approve and monitor performance criteria in certain performance-
based executive compensation plans for 1997.

(a) Maximum permissible benefit under ERISA from the qualified
retirement income plan for 1997 was $125,000. Annual compensation
exceeding $160,000 is not considered in computing the maximum
permissible benefit under the qualified plan. The Company has a
non-qualified supplemental retirement plan to provide full
accrued benefits to all employees in excess of IRS maximums.

Annual average compensation covered by the qualified and non-
qualified retirement plans and credited years of service for
individuals named in Item 11(a) are as follows:  William K. Coors
- - $274,441 and 58 years; Peter H. Coors - $503,255 and 26 years;
W. Leo Kiely III - $408,095 and 4 years; L. Don Brown - $379,635
and 2 years and Timothy V. Wolf - $317,989 and 3 years.

The Company's principal retirement income plan is a defined
benefit plan. The amount of contribution for officers is not
included in the above table since total plan contributions cannot
be readily allocated to individual employees. The Company's most
recent actuarial valuation was as of January 1, 1997, in which
the ratio of plan contributions to total compensation covered by
the plan was approximately 6.5%. Covered compensation is defined
as the total base salary (average of three highest consecutive
years out of the last 10) of employees participating in the plan,
including commissions but excluding bonuses and overtime pay.
Compensation also includes amounts deferred by the individual
under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) and any amounts
deferred into a plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 125.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. An employee with at
least 5 years of vesting service may retire as early as age 55.
Benefits are reduced for early retirement based on an employee's
age and years of service at retirement; however, benefits are not
reduced if: (1) the employee is at least age 62 when payments
commence; or (2) the employee's age plus years of service equal
at least 85 and the employee has worked for CBC at least 25
years. The amount of pension actually accrued under the pension
formula is in the form of a straight life annuity.

In addition to the annual benefit from the qualified retirement
plan, Peter H. Coors is covered by a salary continuation
agreement. This agreement provides for a lump sum cash payment to
the officer upon normal retirement in an amount actuarially
equivalent in value to 30% of the officer's last annual base
salary, payable for the remainder of the officer's life, but not
less than 10 years. The interest rate used in calculating the
lump sum is determined using 80% of the annual average yield of
the 10-year Treasury constant maturities for the month preceding
the month of retirement. Using 1997 eligible salary amounts as
representative of the last annual base salary, the estimated lump
sum amount for Peter H. Coors would be based upon an annual
benefit of $162,000, paid upon normal retirement.

VI. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

The Company adopted the Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (EC Plan) effective May 16, 1991. The EC Plan provides
for two grants of ACC's Class B common stock (non-voting) to non-
employee (NE) directors. The first grant is automatic and equals
20% of the annual retainer. The second grant is elective and
allows the NE directors to take a portion, or all, of the
remaining annual retainer in stock. Amounts of both grants are
determined by the fair market value of the shares on the date of
grant. Shares received under either grant may not be sold or
disposed of before completion of the annual term. The Company
reserved 50,000 shares of stock to be issued under the EC Plan.
The NE directors' annual retainer is $32,000.

In 1997, the NE members of the board of directors were paid 50%
of the $32,000 annual retainer for the 1996-1997 term and 50% of
the $32,000 annual retainer for the 1997-1998 term, as well as
reimbursement of expenses incurred to perform their duties as
directors. Directors who are full-time employees of the Company
receive $15,000 annually. All directors are reimbursed for any
expenses incurred while attending board or committee meetings and
in connection with any other CBC business. In addition, Joseph
Coors, as a director and retired executive officer, is provided
an office, transportation and secretarial support from CBC.

VII. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS

CBC has no agreements with executives or employees providing
employment for a set period.

L. Don Brown has an agreement providing a guaranteed bonus of 80%
of his base salary in 1996 and 1997. In addition, he received a
$200,000 signing bonus and a $100,000 transitional bonus in 1996.
If he were terminated without cause during the first two years,
he would receive 12 months of his total current annual salary
(base plus bonus).

The standard severance program for officers is one year of base salary 
plus a prorated portion of any earned bonus for the year of severance.

Under the 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan), if there is a change in 
ownership of the Company, the options and restricted shares vest immediately.

VIII. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

J. Bruce Llewellyn, Pamela H. Patsley and Wayne R. Sanders served
on the Compensation Committee during 1997.

(a)  In 1996, William K. Coors and Peter H. Coors were two of the
trustees of the Adolph Coors Foundation, which owned 732,413
shares of Class B common stock. This stock was disposed of during
1997. William K. Coors, Joseph Coors and Peter H. Coors are
trustees, in addition to other trustees and beneficiaries or
contingent beneficiaries in certain cases, of various trusts that
own an aggregate of 16,712,111 shares of Class B common stock.
These individuals, and others, are trustees of three other trusts
owning 267,100 shares of Class B common stock. In certain of
these trusts, they act solely as trustees and have no vested or
contingent benefits. The total of these trust shares, together
with other management shares shown above, represents 52% of the
total number of shares of such class outstanding.

(b) This column represents exercisable options to purchase shares
under the Company's 1990 EI Plan (as amended and restated) and
the 1991 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (as
amended and restated) that could be exercised as of March 16,
1998. It reflects restricted stock awards granted under the 1990
EI Plan. Vesting in the restricted stock is over a three-year
period from date of grant for employee/officers and at the end of
the term for outside directors. In the event of a change in
control of the Company, the options and restricted shares vest
immediately. It also reflects a special restricted stock award
made in February 1997. This restricted stock has a one-year vesting period.

(c)  Changes in Control

There are no arrangements that would later result in a change of
control of the Company.

ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

(a)  Transactions with Management and Others

There were no transactions that exceeded $60,000 with management
or others related to the Company.

(b)  Certain Business Relationships

William K. Coors, a director of both ACC and ACX during 1997, and
Peter H. Coors are trustees of one or more family trusts that
collectively own all of ACC's voting stock and approximately 47%
of ACX's common stock (see Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management in Item 12). Joseph Coors, a
director of ACC during 1997, resigned as director of ACX in July
1996. ACC and ACX, or their subsidiaries have certain business
relationships and have engaged or proposed to engage in certain
transactions with one another, as described below.

When ACX was spun off in 1992, CBC entered into market-based,
long-term supply agreements with certain ACX subsidiaries to
provide CBC packaging, aluminum and starch products. Under the
packaging supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase all of its
paperboard (including composite packages, labels and certain can
wrappers) from an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997,
this contract was modified and extended until at least 1999. In
early 1997, ACX's aluminum manufacturing business was sold to a
third party. The aluminum contracts were canceled in 1995. Since
late 1994, American National Can Company (ANC) has been the
purchasing agent for the joint venture between ANC and CBC and
has ordered limited quantities of can, end and tab stock from the
now-former ACX subsidiary. Additionally, ANC purchased a small
quantity of tab stock for the joint venture from this subsidiary
in early 1997. Under the starch supply agreement, CBC agreed to
purchase 100 million pounds of refined corn starch annually from
an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997, this agreement was
renegotiated, at slightly higher rates, and extended through
1999. CBC's total purchases under these agreements in 1997 were
approximately $118 million. Purchases in 1998 under the packaging
and starch supply agreements are estimated to be approximately $120 million.

During 1997, CBC sold small quantities of aluminum scrap to a now-
former ACX subsidiary in the amount of $280,000. CBC also agreed
to sell brewery by-products to an ACX subsidiary for resale under
a contract through 1997. In early 1997, this agreement was extended 
through 1999. CBC received approximately $9 million in 1997 under this 
contract and estimates that 1998 receipts will be approximately $9 million.

Also with the spin-off, ACC, ACX and their subsidiaries
negotiated other agreements involving employee matters,
environmental management, tax sharing and trademark licensing.
These agreements govern certain relationships between the
parties, as described in the Company's report on Form 8-K dated
December 27, 1992, and contained in the information statement
mailed to ACC's shareholders at the time of the spin-off.

Certain ACC and ACX subsidiaries are parties to other
miscellaneous market-based transactions. In 1997, CBC provided
water and waste water treatment services to an ACX ceramics
facility located on property leased from CBC, and CBC received
real estate management and other services from the ACX real
estate brokerage subsidiary. In addition, CBC purchased
miscellaneous products from the ACX ceramics subsidiary,
including certain ceramic can tooling for CBC's can lines. During
1997, CBC received approximately $340,000 in total and paid
approximately $350,000 in total under these agreements and
transactions. In 1998, CBC expects to pay approximately $230,000
and receive approximately $260,000 under these agreements.

CBC is a limited partner in a partnership in which an ACX
subsidiary is the general partner. The partnership, which was
formed at the time of the spin-off, owns, develops, operates and
sells certain real estate previously owned directly by CBC or
ACC. Distributions of $1.3 million were made to both partners in
1997. Each partner is obligated to make additional cash
contributions of $500,000 upon call of the general partner.
Distributions are allocated equally between the partners until
CBC recovers its investment, and thereafter 80% to the general
partner and 20% to CBC. Currently distributions are still being
split equally between the partners.

(c)  Indebtedness of Management

Employee loans could be made with the exercise of stock options
granted under the 1983 non-qualified Adolph Coors Company Stock
Option Plan. No such loans were made or outstanding in 1997.

No member of management or another with a direct or indirect
interest in ACC was indebted to the Company in excess of $60,000 in 1997.

Other Matters

To comply with the July 13, 1990, amendments governing Form S-8
under the Securities Act of 1933, ACC offers as follows, which is
incorporated by reference into ACC's Registration Statements on
Form S-8 No. 33-2761 (filed January 17, 1986); No. 33-35035
(filed May 24, 1990); No. 33-40730 (filed May 21, 1991) and No. 33-59979 
(filed June 6, 1995) and on Form S-3 No. 33-33831 (filed March 14, 1990):

Even though ACC could indemnify its directors, officers and
controlling persons for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 under SEC regulations, the SEC has indicated that
such indemnification is against public policy and unenforceable.
If a director, officer or controlling person requests
indemnification for liabilities arising from securities being
registered (other than for reimbursements of amounts paid for the
successful defense of any lawsuit), ACC will ask a court if such
indemnification is against public policy and will follow that
court's ruling.
