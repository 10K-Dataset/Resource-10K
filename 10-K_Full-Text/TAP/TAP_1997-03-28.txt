ITEM 1. Business

(a)  General Development of Business

Founded in 1873 and incorporated in Colorado in 1913, Adolph
Coors Company (ACC or the Company) is the holding company for
Coors Brewing Company (CBC), the third-largest U.S. brewer.

CBC owns Coors Distributing Company (CDC) and several smaller
subsidiaries, including Coors Transportation Company; Coors
Energy Company (CEC); The Wannamaker Ditch Company and The Rocky
Mountain Water Company, which carry process water from nearby
Clear Creek to various CBC reservoirs in the Golden area; Coors
Brewing Company International, Inc. (CBCI); Coors Global, Inc.
(Global); Coors Intercontinental, Inc. (Intercontinental); and
Coors Japan Company, Ltd. (Coors Japan).

CDC owns and operates distributorships in several markets across
the United States. CDC's 1996 operations accounted for
approximately 5.6% of CBC's total beer sales.

Through a subsidiary, CEC continues to operate a gas transmission
pipeline that provides energy to CBC's Shenandoah facility.

CBC, CBCI, Global, and Intercontinental own Coors Brewing
International C.V. (the CV), which in turn owns Coors Brewing
Iberica, S.A. (Coors Iberica) and Coors Services, S.A. Established in 1995, 
Coors Services, S.A. provides management and administrative services to 
CBC. The CV acts as a holding company and a finance subsidiary.

Some of the following statements describe the Company's
expectations of future products and business plans, financial
results, performance, and events. Actual results may differ
materially from these forward-looking statements.

(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company has continuing operations in a single industry
segment, the production and marketing of malt-based beverages.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Coors Brewing Company - General

CBC produces and markets high-quality malt-based beverages. CBC
concentrates on distinctive premium and above-premium brands that
provide higher-than-average margins. Most of CBC's sales are in
U.S. markets; however, the Company is committed to building
profitable sales in international markets. Sales of malt
beverages totaled 20 million barrels in 1996, 20.3 million
barrels in 1995, and 20.4 million barrels in 1994. (See Item 7
for discussion of changes in volume.)

Marketing

Principal products and services:  CBC currently has 26 brands in
its portfolio, of which seven are premium products which make up
the Coors family of beers:  Coors Light; Original Coors; Coors
Artic Ice; Coors Artic Ice Light; Coors Extra Gold; Coors
Dry; and Coors Cutter, a non-alcoholic brew.

CBC also produces and markets Zima, an innovative malt-based, above-premium 
beverage, and Herman Joseph's, a special premium beer with a craft-brewed 
flavor without the heavy taste or high price of craft-brewed beers.

Through UniBev, Ltd. (UniBev), an operating unit focusing on
specialty and import beers, CBC offers specialty, above-premium
beers, including Winterfest; Blue Moon Honey Blonde Ale; Blue
Moon Nut Brown Ale; Blue Moon Belgian White Ale; Blue Moon
Raspberry Cream Ale; Blue Moon Abbey Ale; and Blue Moon Harvest
Pumpkin Ale, a seasonal product. Also through UniBev, CBC sells
several imported and/or licensed products, including George
Killian's Irish Red, George Killian's Irish Brown Ale, George
Killian's Irish Honey Ale, and Steinlager. Steinlager is New
Zealand's number-one premium beer and is distributed under
license from Lion Nathan International of New Zealand.

Through a foreign joint venture, CBC also produces Cass Fresh,
which is distributed in South Korea.

CBC also sells popular-priced products, including Keystone,
Keystone Light, Keystone Dry, Keystone Ice, and Keystone Amber Light.

CBC's beverages are sold in most states, except for Coors Dry
which is in limited distribution. CBC exports or produces and sells 
many products overseas, which are described in greater detail below.

In 1995, CBC celebrated the grand opening of Coors Fieldr
ballpark in Denver, Colorado, by opening The SandLot Brewery at
Coors Field, the first brewery in a ballpark. This brewery, which
is open year-round, makes a variety of specialty beers and has an
annual capacity of approximately 4,000 barrels.

New products/opportunities:  In 1996, CBC introduced Killian's
Irish Honey Ale, which joined Killian's Irish Red and Killian's
Irish Brown Ale in establishing the Irish family of brands.

Blue Moon Brewing Company (Blue Moon), an operating unit within
UniBev created during 1995, supports a product line of unique specialty 
brews that are contract-brewed by Hudepohl Schoenling and marketed by 
UniBev. Blue Moon introduced one new products in 1996, Blue Moon Raspberry 
Cream Ale, and one in early 1997, Blue Moon Abbey Ale.

During 1996, Memphis Brown (which was introduced in early 1996),
Coorsr Red Light, Coors Special Lager, and Castlemaine XXXX
were discontinued because the market performances of these
products did not meet expectations.

Brand names, trademarks, patents, and licenses:  CBC owns
trademarks on all brands it produces and recognizes that consumer
knowledge of and loyalty to its brand names and trademarks are
vital to CBC's long-term success. It also holds several patents,
with expiration dates ranging from 1997 to 2017, on innovative
processes related to product formulae, can making, can
decorating, and certain other technical operations. CBC receives
revenue from royalties and licenses, but its business is not
substantially dependent upon such revenue.

Brand performance:  Coors Light is CBC's best-selling brand and
has generated approximately two-thirds of its total sales volume
for the past three years. CBC's second-most-popular brand is
Original Coors. Premium and above-premium beers account for
approximately 88% of CBC's total sales volume.

Domestic sales:  The Company's highest-volume states are
California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey,
comprising 45% of total domestic volume.

Eight geographic field business areas manage domestic sales. This
geographic segmentation allows CBC to better anticipate and
respond quickly to wholesaler and consumer needs.

International business:  CBC is committed to increasing its
international presence through export sales, licensing
agreements, joint ventures, and foreign production facilities.

Through its U.S. and foreign production facilities, CBC markets
its products to approximately 40 international markets and to
U.S. military bases worldwide. Export sales are significantly
more profitable, on a per-barrel-basis, than domestic sales.

Under an interim agreement, Molson Breweries of Canada Limited
(Molson) brews and distributes Original Coors and Coors Light in
Canada (see below). After Molson permitted Miller Brewing Company
(Miller) to purchase a 20% ownership interest in Molson in 1993,
CBC initiated two legal actions regarding its licensing
arrangement with Molson. These actions have not impacted the
success of CBC's brands in Canada, where Coors Light is the best-
selling light beer. On October 18, 1996, an arbitration panel
ruled that the licensing agreement terminated in 1993 when Miller
acquired its ownership interest in Molson. This ruling returns
Canadian rights to all CBC brands to CBC and requires Molson to
compensate CBC for the period beginning April 2, 1993. Although
CBC believes the compensation awarded will be significant, that
compensation cannot be quantified until the next phase of
arbitration is completed during 1997.

Also in its ruling, the arbitration panel found that Molson had
underpaid royalties from January 1, 1991, to April 1, 1993. Thus,
Molson paid CBC $6.1 million in cash (net of $680,000 of
withholding taxes) during 1996 to cover the unpaid royalties plus
interest. In January 1997, Molson filed an appeal to this phase
of the arbitration. Management believes the appeal is without merit.

CBC and Molson have agreed that Molson will continue to brew and
distribute CBC's products for an interim period ending no earlier
than July 1, 1997. Income from the interim agreement is based upon actual 
CBC brand sales volume in Canada and is reported as gross sales in the 
accompanying financial statements. Management continues to work on CBC's 
options for future business in Canada and believes these opportunities 
could provide greater financial returns than were available under the 
terminated licensing agreement with Molson.

Coors Japan, the exclusive importer of Coors products into Japan
and based in Tokyo, distributes, markets, and sells CBC's
products in Japan, where the Coors brand has been one of the top
three foreign premium brands for nine years.

Since September 1992, a joint venture between CBC and Scottish Courage 
has brewed and/or distributed Coors Extra Gold in the United Kingdom and 
Ireland. Coors Extra Gold was rated overall Best Draught Lager at the 
1994 Brewing Industry International Awards in England.

Beginning in 1991, CBC formed Jinro-Coors Brewing Company (JCBC),
a joint venture with Jinro Limited of the Republic of Korea. CBC
owns one-third of JCBC, while Jinro Limited owns the remaining
two-thirds. JCBC began production of Cass Fresh in its South
Korean brewery in the second quarter of 1994. JCBC's brewing
capacity was expanded to approximately 3.6 million barrels in
1995. Currently, Cass Fresh represents 20% of the South Korean
market. JCBC's financial results are not included in CBC's
financial statements, as CBC's investment is accounted for under
the cost basis of accounting, since it does not have the ability
to significantly influence JCBC's business operations. CBC holds
a put option on its $22 million investment in JCBC, which
entitles CBC to require Jinro Limited to purchase CBC's
investment at the greater of cost or market value through March
1999. JCBC began production of Cass Fresh in its brewery in the second
quarter of 1994 and achieved a 20% share of the Korean market by the
end of 1996. JCBC also achieved positive operating income in 1996 but
has not yet been profitable due to debt service costs.

In March 1994, Coors Iberica purchased a 500,000-hectoliter
brewery in Zaragoza, Spain, from El Aguila S.A. of Madrid, Spain,
which is owned 51% by Amsterdam-based Heineken, N.V. (the world's
second-largest brewer). CBC's total investment in Spain is
expected to exceed $50 million, including the initial purchase
price and future operations and marketing expenditures. CBC will
contract-brew El Aguila products through 1998.

Coors Iberica brews Coors Gold for sale in Spain and the Coors
Extra Gold brand for export to approximately 20 international
markets. Coors Iberica also brews Coors Light for export to the
United Kingdom and Ireland. El Aguila distributes Coors products
in Spain, while Coors Iberica and El Aguila jointly manage sales
and marketing. This arrangement provides advantages over
exporting products directly from U.S. facilities. Financial results 
of the Zaragoza brewery are included in ACC's financial statements.

In early 1996, ACC established a foreign sales corporation, Coors Export 
Ltd., to take advantage of favorable U.S. tax laws involving foreign sales.

Product distribution:  A national network of 571 independent
distributors and four distributorships owned and operated by CDC
deliver CBC products to U.S. retail markets. Some distributors
operate multiple branches, bringing the total number of U.S.
distributor/branch locations to 625. Independent distributors
deliver CBC products to some export/international markets under
certain licensing and distribution agreements.

To ensure the highest product quality, CBC monitors distributors'
methods of handling Coors products. This monitoring helps ensure
adherence to proper refrigeration and rotation guidelines for
CBC's malt beverages at both wholesale and retail locations.
Distributors are required to replace CBC products if consumer
sales have not occurred within prescribed time frames.

Transportation

Given the location of its three production facilities in the
U.S., CBC must ship its products a greater distance than most
competitors. By packaging some products in the Memphis and
Shenandoah facilities, CBC achieves more efficient product
distribution and reduced freight costs to certain markets. Major
competitors have multiple breweries from which to deliver
products, thereby incurring lower transportation costs than CBC.

Burlington Northern, Inc. transports approximately 68% of the
products packaged at CBC's Golden facility to Denver. From there,
various railroads ship the products to satellite redistribution
centers and distributors throughout the country. The railcars assigned to 
CBC are specially built and insulated to keep Coors products cold en route.

CBC currently uses 18 strategically located satellite
redistribution centers to transfer its products from railcars to
trucks for shipment to distributors. In 1996, approximately 73%
of total railcar volume of packaged product from Golden moved
through the satellite redistribution centers.

As noted above, CBC relies heavily upon rail distribution of its
products. Any disruption by strike would impact CBC more than its
major competitors, but, in management's opinion, the risk of such
disruption appears very low.

The remaining 32% of products packaged in Golden is shipped by
truck and intermodal (piggyback) directly to distributors.
Transportation vehicles are also refrigerated or insulated to
keep CBC's malt beverages at proper temperatures while in transit.

Operations

Production/packaging capacity:  CBC currently has three domestic
production facilities. It owns and operates the world's largest
single-site brewery in Golden, Colorado; a packaging and brewing
facility in Memphis, Tennessee; and a packaging and distribution
facility near Elkton, Virginia (referred to as the Shenandoah facility).

The Golden brewery is the source location for all brands with the
Coors name except for Coors Cutter. Approximately 65% of CBC's
beer is packaged in Golden; substantially all of the remainder is
shipped in bulk from the Golden brewery to the Memphis and
Shenandoah facilities for blending, finishing, and packaging.

The Memphis facility currently packages all products exported
from the United States and brews and packages Zima, Killian's
Irish Honey Ale, and Coors Cutter. Depending on product mix and
market opportunities, the full utilization of brewing capacity in
Memphis may or may not require additions to plant and equipment.

The Shenandoah facility currently packages certain CBC products
for distribution to Eastern markets and could be expanded, if necessary.

At the end of 1996, CBC had approximately 25 million barrels of
annual brewing capacity and 30 million barrels of annual
packaging capacity. Current capacity depends upon product mix and
may change with shifting consumer preferences for specific brands
and/or packages. CBC's three facilities provide sufficient
brewing and packaging capacity to meet foreseeable consumer
demand. The proliferation of products and packages creates
logistical challenges for CBC, as well as for the industry.

Most of CBC's aluminum can, end, glass bottle, and malt
requirements are produced in owned facilities or facilities
operated by joint ventures in which CBC is a partner. CBC has
arranged for sufficient container supplies with its joint venture
partners and has sufficient malting facilities to fulfill its
current and projected requirements.

Container manufacturing facilities:  CBC owns a can manufacturing
facility, which produces approximately 3.6 billion aluminum cans
per year, and an aluminum can end manufacturing facility, which
provides CBC aluminum ends and tabs. Total container assets
comprise approximately 10.2% of CBC's properties. In 1994, CBC
and American National Can Company (ANC) formed a joint venture to
produce beverage cans and ends at CBC's manufacturing facilities
for sale to CBC and outside customers. The joint venture's
initial term is seven years but can be extended for two
additional three-year terms. The joint venture has improved the
technology and utilization of both facilities and has enhanced
this investment's return. In 1996, CBC purchased approximately
96% of the cans produced. The joint venture is committed to
supplying 100% of the Golden facility's can and end requirements.

In June 1995, CBC and Anchor Glass Container Corporation (Anchor)
established a joint venture partnership, the Rocky Mountain Bottle Company 
(RMBC), to produce glass bottles at the CBC glass manufacturing facility. 
The joint venture has lowered unit costs, increased output, and created 
efficiencies at the glass plant. CBC contributed approximately $16.2 
million in machinery, equipment, and certain personal property to RMBC. The
partnership's initial term is 10 years and can be extended for
additional two-year periods.

In 1996, RMBC produced approximately 783 million bottles; CBC
purchased approximately 97% of the bottles produced. To assist in
its goal of manufacturing bottles with recycled material, CBC
constructed a glass recycling facility in Wheat Ridge, Colorado,
in 1994 and doubled the amount of glass the facility can recycle
annually. RMBC operates the recycling facility.

Anchor declared bankruptcy in September 1996. Effective February
5, 1997, Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens) replaced
Anchor as CBC's partner in RMBC as a result of Anchor's
bankruptcy declaration and the related sale of certain Anchor
assets to Owens and Consumers Packaging, Inc. Further, Owens has
replaced Anchor as the 100% preferred supplier of bottles to CBC
for bottle requirements not met by RMBC.

Other facilities:  CBC owns waste treatment facilities, which process 
waste from CBC's manufacturing operations and from the City of Golden.

In September 1995, CBC sold its power plant equipment and support
facilities to Trigen-Nations Energy Corporation, L.L.L.P.
(Trigen) for approximately $22 million. CBC has agreed to
purchase from Trigen the electricity and steam needed to operate
its Golden facilities. This 25-year agreement also requires that
significant capital improvements be made by Trigen.

CBC continues to improve asset utilization by divesting non-core
assets and by continuing to improve capacity utilization through
joint ventures and alliances. Joint venture partnerships and certain other 
outsourcing arrangements for malting operations are being explored. If 
appropriate outsourcing arrangements are not made, CBC may have to invest 
in significant capital improvements for its malting operations.

Capital expansion:  In 1996, the Company spent approximately $63
million in capital expenditures. While management plans to invest
appropriately in order to ensure ongoing productivity and
efficiency of CBC assets, priority will be given to those
projects the Company believes offer returns in excess of CBC's
cost of capital. The Company expects its capital expenditures for
1997 to be approximately $85 million.

Raw Materials/Sources and Availability

CBC's beers are made with all natural ingredients, and its
brewing cycle is one of the longest in the industry. CBC adheres
to strict formulation and quality standards in selecting its raw
materials and believes it has sufficient access to raw materials
and packaging supplies to meet its quality and production requirements.

Barley, barley malt, starch, and hops:  CBC uses a proprietary
strain of barley, developed by its agronomists, in most of its
malt beverages. Virtually all of this barley is grown on
irrigated farmland in the western United States under contractual
agreements with area farmers. CBC's malting facility in Golden
produces malt for all CBC products, except Zima and Blue Moon.
CBC maintains inventory levels in owned locations sufficient to continue
production in the event of any disruption in barley or malt supplies.

Rice and refined cereal starch (which are interchangeable in
CBC's brewing process) and foreign and domestic hops are purchased 
from outside suppliers. Adequate inventories are maintained to continue 
production through any foreseeable disruption in supply.

Water:  CBC uses naturally filtered water from underground
aquifers to brew malt beverages at its Golden facility. Water
from private deep wells is used for brewing, final blending, and
packaging operations at plants located outside Colorado. Water
quality and composition were primary factors in all facility site
selections. Water from CBC's sources in Golden, Memphis, and
Shenandoah is ideally balanced with minerals and dissolved solids
to brew high-quality malt beverages.

CBC continually monitors the quality of all the water used in its
brewing and packaging processes for compliance with its own
stringent quality standards as well as applicable federal and
state water standards. CBC owns water rights believed to be
adequate to meet all of its present requirements for both brewing
and industrial uses; however, it continues to acquire water
rights and add water reservoir capacity, as appropriate, to
provide for long-term strategic growth plans and to sustain
brewing operations in the event of a prolonged drought.

Packaging materials:  During 1996, approximately 58% of CBC's
malt beverages were packaged in aluminum cans. Approximately 39%
of the cost of malt beverages packaged in cans is the cost of the
aluminum can. CBC purchases most of its cans and ends from the
joint venture with ANC. Aluminum cans for products packaged at
the Memphis plant are purchased from an outside supplier.

Glass bottles were used to package approximately 30% of CBC's beverages 
in 1996; about half of these bottles were produced by RMBC.

The remainder (12%) of the malt beverages sold during 1996 was
packaged in quarter- and half-barrel stainless steel kegs and two
different sizes of a plastic sphere called "The Party Ball," a
packaging innovation introduced by CBC in 1988.

Graphic Packaging Corporation, a subsidiary of ACX Technologies,
Inc. (ACX), supplies much of the secondary packaging for CBC's
products, including bottle labels and paperboard products.

Supply contracts with ACX companies:  When ACX was spun off from
ACC in 1992, CBC negotiated long-term supply contracts with
certain ACX subsidiaries for aluminum, starch, and packaging
materials. These contracts, negotiated at market prices, were to
be in effect through 1997. The aluminum contracts were canceled
in 1995, and the starch contract was extended in 1997 to run
through 1999. The contract for packaging materials was modified
in 1997 and extended  until at least 1999. See Item 11, Compensation 
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation for further details.

Energy:  CBC purchases electricity and steam for its Golden
manufacturing facilities from Trigen. CEC supplies Trigen with
coal for its steam generator system. CBC does not anticipate
future energy supply problems.

Seasonality of the Business

The beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation. CBC's
sales volumes are normally at their lowest in the first and
fourth quarters and highest in the second and third quarters. The
Company's fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the
last Sunday in December. The 1996 fiscal year was 52 weeks long,
while fiscal 1995 was 53 weeks long.

Research and Project Development

CBC's research and project development expenditures relate
primarily to new products and packages; brewing processes,
ingredients, and equipment; packaging supplies; and environmental
improvements and cost reductions in processes and packaging
materials. These activities are meant to improve the quality and
value of CBC's products while reducing costs through more
efficient processing and packaging techniques and equipment
design, as well as improved varieties of raw materials.
Approximately $12.8 million, $15.4 million, and $13.3 million
were spent on research and development in 1996, 1995, and 1994,
respectively. The Company expects to spend approximately $13
million on research and project development in 1997.

To support new product development, CBC maintains a fully
equipped pilot brewery, with a 6,500-barrel annual capacity,
within the Golden facility enabling CBC to brew small batches of
innovative products without interrupting ongoing production and
operations in the main brewery.

Regulations

Federal laws and regulations govern the operations of breweries;
the federal government and all states regulate trade practices,
advertising and marketing practices, distributor relationships,
and related matters. Governmental entities also levy various
taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require
bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

A number of emerging regulatory issues could impact the Company's
business operations over the next few years, including potential
increases in state and federal excise taxes, restrictions on the
advertising and sale of alcohol beverages, new packaging
regulations and taxes, and others.

Federal excise taxes on malt beverages are currently $18 per
barrel. State excise taxes also are levied at rates that ranged
in 1996 from a high of $32.65 per barrel in Alabama to a low of
$0.62 per barrel in Wyoming, with an average of $7.67 per barrel.
In 1996, CBC paid approximately $379 million in federal and state
excise taxes. A substantial increase in federal or state excise
taxes would have a negative impact on sales and profitability of
the entire industry, including CBC. CBC is vigorously opposed to
any increases in federal and/or state excise taxes and will work
diligently to ensure that its view is represented adequately.

Environmental

Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and
regulations did not materially affect the Company's 1996 capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

The Company continues to promote the efficient use of resources,
waste reduction, and pollution prevention. Programs currently
under way include recycling, down-weighting of product packages,
and, where practical, increasing the recycled content of product
packaging materials, paper, and other supplies. Several employee
task forces continually seek effective ways to control hazardous
materials and to reduce emissions and waste.

Employees and Employee Relations

The Company has approximately 5,800 full-time employees. Of CBC's
three domestic production facilities, only the Memphis plant
workers have union representation (Teamsters). In general,
relations with employees have been satisfactory.

Competitive Conditions

Known trends and competitive conditions:  Industry and
competitive information was compiled from the following industry
sources:  Beer Marketer's Insights and The Maxwell Consumer Report. 
While management believes these sources are reliable, the Company 
cannot guarantee the absolute accuracy of these numbers and estimates.

1996 industry overview:  The beer industry in the United States
is highly competitive. Industry volume growth has averaged less
than 1% a year since 1991. Domestic beer industry shipments in
1996 increased an estimated 1.4%. By contrast, 1995 domestic
shipments were down 1.1% from the year before. In recent years,
brewers have attempted to gain market share through competitive
pricing, marketing, promotions, and innovative packaging. In
1996, price promotions and price discounting continued to limit
growth in net price realizations for brewers, although not as
much as in 1995. It is estimated that more than 60% of the beer
sold for consumption off-premise in 1996 was sold on promotion.

Early indications point toward smaller growth in net price
realizations in 1997 than in 1996. It is possible that competitors 
will concentrate primarily on market share gains in 1997 instead 
of profitability, which will place additional downward pressure 
on pricing. Unit volume growth for major U.S. brewers continues 
to depend on growth in light beer sales, introductions of new 
products, and expansion into international markets.

A number of important trends continued in the U.S. beer market in
1996. The first was a trend toward "trading up." Consumers
continued to move away from lower-priced brands to higher-priced
brands, including specialty products and imports in the above-
premium category. While microbreweries continued to benefit from this 
trend, their growth rate as a group slowed in the second half of 1996.

To capitalize on the trend toward specialty products and craft-
brewed beers, brewers continued to introduce new specialty
brands, but at a slower rate than in 1995. At the end of 1996,
there were nearly 1,100 brands of beer in the United States, up
from 675 in 1991. This proliferation of products creates unique
challenges in operations, logistics, and marketing for all
brewers, distributors, and retailers.

The U.S. brewing industry also continues to consolidate. In 1996,
the Stroh Brewery Company acquired the brands and assets of G.
Heileman Brewing Company Inc., moving Stroh closer to CBC in
total unit sales. It is important to note, however, that Stroh
competes primarily in the subpremium category of the industry,
unlike CBC, which among major U.S. brewers has the highest volume
percentage in the premium and above-premium categories.

CBC competitive position:  CBC's malt beverages compete with
numerous above-premium, premium, low-calorie, popular-priced, non-
alcohol, and imported brands produced by national, regional,
local, and international brewers. Nearly 88% of domestic volume
is attributable to the top five domestic brewers:  Anheuser-
Busch, Inc. (AB); Philip Morris, Inc., through its subsidiary
Miller Brewing Company (Miller); CBC; The Stroh Brewery Company
(now including G. Heileman Brewing); and S & P Company. CBC
competes most directly with AB and Miller, the dominant companies
in the industry. CBC is the nation's third-largest brewer and,
according to Beer Marketer's Insights estimates, accounted for
approximately 9.9% of the total 1996 U.S. brewing industry shipments 
of malt beverages (including exports and U.S. shipments of imports). 
This compares to AB's 45.2% share and Miller's 21.8% share.

Given its industry position, CBC continues to face significant
competitive disadvantages related to economies of scale. Besides
lower transportation costs achieved by competitors with multiple
breweries, these larger brewers also recognize economies of scale
in advertising expenditures because of their greater volume. CBC,
in an effort to achieve and maintain national advertising
exposure, must spend substantially more per barrel of beer sold
than its major competitors. Significant levels of advertising are
necessary for CBC to hold and increase its U.S. market share.
This, coupled with ongoing price competition, puts more pressure
on CBC's margins in comparison to those of CBC's principal competitors.

The original brewery site at Golden, which is approximately 2,400
acres, contains brewing, packaging, can manufacturing and related
facilities, as well as gravel deposits and water-storage facilities.

CBC's can and end plants are operated by a joint venture between CBC and ANC.

CBC's bottle plant is operated by a joint venture between CBC and
Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc.

The distribution warehouses are held by CDC.

The Company owns 2,700 acres of land in Rockingham County,
Virginia, where the Shenandoah facility is located, and 132 acres
in Shelby County, Tennessee, where the Memphis facility is located.

All of the Company's facilities are well-maintained and suitable
for their respective operations. In 1996, CBC estimates that its
brewing facilities operated at approximately 79% of the 1997
brewing capacity and its packaging facilities operated at
approximately 66% of the 1997 packaging capacity.  Annual production 
capacity can vary due to product and packaging mix and seasonality.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

See the Environmental section of Item 7 Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
a discussion of the Company's obligation for potential remediation costs 
at the Lowry Landfill Superfund site and related legal proceedings.

The Company is party to numerous other legal proceedings arising
from its business operations. In each proceeding, the Company is
vigorously defending the allegations. Although the eventual
outcome of the various proceedings cannot be predicted, no single
such proceeding and no group of such similar matters are expected
to result in liability that would be material to the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

ACC is the holding company for Coors Brewing Company (CBC), which
produces and markets high-quality malt-based beverages.

This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting ACC's
consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources
for the three-year period ended December 29, 1996, and should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto
included elsewhere in this report.

ACC's fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Sunday in 
December. The 1996 fiscal year was 52 weeks long, while fiscal 1995
was 53 weeks long.

Certain unusual or nonrecurring items impacted ACC's financial results
for 1996, 1995, and 1994, making clear evaluation of its ongoing
operations somewhat complicated. These items are summarized below.

Summary of operating results:
                                           For the years ended
                             December 29,      December 31,     December 25,
                                    1996              1995             1994
                                 (In thousands, except earnings per share)  
Operating income:
  As reported                    $81,019           $80,378         $108,163
  Excluding special items         87,360            65,178           94,214
Net income:

  Excluding special items         47,299            33,944           49,720
Earnings per share:
  As reported                      $1.14             $1.13            $1.52
  Excluding special items          $1.24             $0.89            $1.30


1996:  For the 52-week fiscal year ended December 29, 1996, ACC
reported net income of $43.4 million, or $1.14 per share. During 1996,
the Company received royalties and interest from Molson Breweries of
Canada Limited (Molson) in response to the October 1996 arbitration
ruling that Molson had underpaid royalties from January 1, 1991, to
April 1, 1993. Further, ACC recorded a gain from the 1995 curtailment
of certain postretirement benefits, charges for Molson-related
legal expenses, and severance expenses for a limited work force
reduction. The net effect of these special items was a pretax charge of
$6.3 million, or $0.10 per share, after tax. Without this net special charge,
ACC would have reported net earnings of $47.3 million, or $1.24 per share.

1995:  For the 53-week fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, ACC
reported net income of $43.2 million, or $1.13 per share. In the fourth
quarter, the Company recorded a gain from the curtailment of certain
postretirement benefits and a severance charge for a limited work force
reduction. The net effect of these special items was a pretax credit of
$15.2 million, or $0.24 per share, after tax. ACC would have reported net 
income of $33.9 million, or $0.89 per share, without this net special credit.

1994:  For the 52-week fiscal year ended December 25, 1994, ACC
reported net income of $58.1 million, or $1.52 per share. During 1994,
the Company recovered some of the costs associated with the Lowry
Landfill Superfund site and wrote down certain distributor assets. The
net effect of these special items was a pretax credit of $13.9 million,
or $0.22 per share, after tax. Without this net special credit, ACC
would have reported net income of $49.7 million, or $1.30 per share.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS - 1996 VS. 1995 AND 1995
VS. 1994 (EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS)

1996 vs. 1995:  Even though unit volume decreased 1.3%, net sales
increased 3.1% in 1996 from 1995. The decrease in unit volume is caused
by a shorter fiscal year in 1996; 1996 consisted of 52 weeks versus 53
weeks in 1995. On a comparable-calendar basis, 1996 sales volume was
essentially unchanged from 1995. Net sales increased in 1996 from 1995
due to price increases; lower price promotion expenses; reduced freight
charges as a result of direct shipments to certain markets; increased
international sales, which generate higher revenue per barrel than
domestic sales; the impact of CBC's interim agreement with Molson; and
the slight reductions in excise taxes with the increase in export
sales. Lower Zima and Artic Ice volumes and greater proportionate
Keystone volumes negatively impacted net sales per barrel in 1996.

Gross profit in 1996 rose 5.2% to $614.4 million from 1995 due to the
3.1% increase in net sales, as discussed above, offset in part by a
2.0% increase in cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold increased due
to cost increases in paper and glass packaging materials; abandonments
of certain capital projects; cost increases for certain new contract-
brewing arrangements; and cost increases for Japanese operations, which
began in the fourth quarter of 1995. Total gross profit was impacted
positively in 1996 by decreases in brewing material costs; changes in
brand mix (specifically, increases in Coors Light volume offset in part
by decreases in Zima volume and increases in Keystone volume); and
slightly favorable labor costs. Additionally, 1995 gross profit
included the cost of the Zima Gold termination and withdrawal.

Operating income increased 34.0% to $87.4 million in 1996 from 1995
primarily due to the 5.2% increase in gross profit, as discussed
earlier; the 17.1% decrease in research and development expenses;
offset partially by the 13.5% increase in general and administrative
(G&A) expenses. Although marketing expenses were relatively unchanged
from 1995, the focus of such spending was redirected from Zima and
Artic Ice to Original Coors and Coors Light. G&A expenses increased due
to continued investments made in domestic and foreign sales
organizations; incentive compensation increases; increases in officers'
life insurance expenses; increases in costs of operating
distributorships (a distributorship was acquired in 1995); and
increases in administrative costs for certain foreign operations.
Research and development expenses decreased due to the planned
reduction in the number of capital projects in 1996.

Net non-operating expenses in 1996 declined 14.9% from 1995 because of
a 47.5% increase in net miscellaneous income offset in part by a 5.4%
increase in net interest expense. Increased royalties earned on certain
can-decorating technologies caused the increase in miscellaneous
income. Additionally, even though the Company repaid $38 million in
principal on its medium-term notes and incurred no interest charges on
its line of credit (no amounts were borrowed against the line of credit
during 1996), net interest expense increased due to interest incurred
on the private placement Senior Notes and reductions in the amount of
interest capitalized on capital projects.

The Company's effective tax rate increased to 41.8% in 1996 from 41.6%
in 1995 primarily due to changes in cash surrender values of officers'
life insurance. Further, the 1996 effective tax rate exceeded the
statutory rate because of the effects of certain non-deductible
expenses and foreign investments.

Net earnings for 1996 were $47.3 million, or $1.24 per share, compared
to $33.9 million, or $0.89 per share, for 1995, representing a 39.3%
increase in earnings per share.

1995 vs. 1994:  Although total unit volume declined 0.3%, 1995 net
sales increased 0.7% from 1994 because of fourth quarter price
increases in a few high volume states and, to a lesser extent, because
of volume increases in higher-priced international markets. Lower Zima
volumes negatively impacted net sales; Zima volumes declined
approximately 49% in 1995 versus 1994's national rollout volumes.

In 1995, gross profit decreased $15.8 million and also decreased as a
percentage of net sales, down to 34.8% from 36.0% in 1994. This
decrease was primarily due to significant increases in aluminum and
other packaging costs and reduced Zima sales volume, which has a higher
gross profit margin than other brands. Non-recurring costs from the
sale of the power plant equipment and support facilities, the operation
of the RMBC plant, and the write-off of obsolete packaging supplies
also impacted gross profit unfavorably; however, container joint
venture income partially offset these costs (see Note 10 to the
financial statements in Item 8).

From 1994 to 1995, operating income declined 30.8% because of the
decrease in gross profit, as discussed previously; a 2.3% increase in
marketing expenses, including advertising; a 2.2% increase in G&A
expenses; and a 16.0% increase in research and development expenses.
The Company's efforts to strengthen the domestic and international
sales organizations increased marketing expenses. Total advertising
expense was relatively unchanged from 1994; however, the focus was
redirected from Zima, Artic Ice, and Artic Ice Light to Coors Light and
new brand introductions. Labor cost increases and continuing efforts to
develop and execute ACC's performance initiatives caused the increase
in G&A expenses. The increase in the numbers of new products and
packages being considered increased research and development expenses.

Net non-operating expense increased $3.2 million in 1995 compared to
1994. Although ACC paid $44 million in principal on its medium-term
notes, interest expense increased 3.5% in 1995 over 1994 due to the
additional $100 million placement of Senior Notes in the third quarter
of 1995. Further, miscellaneous income decreased 42.8% in 1995 due to
non-recurring gains recognized in 1994 on sales of a distributorship
and certain other investments.

The Company's effective tax rate declined in 1995 to 41.6% from 45.0%
in 1994, primarily due to the effect of a valuation allowance for a tax
loss carryforward and some non-recurring, non-taxable income items in
1995. The 1995 effective tax rate exceeded the statutory rate because
of certain non-deductible expenses.

Net earnings for 1995 were $33.9 million, or $0.89 per share, compared
to $49.7 million, or $1.30 per share, for 1994, representing a 31.5%
decline in earnings per share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by
operating activities and external borrowings. As of December 29, 1996,
ACC had working capital of $124.2 million, and its net cash position
was $110.9 million compared to $32.4 million as of December 31, 1995,
and $27.2 million as of December 25, 1994. The Company believes that
cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings will be sufficient
to meet its ongoing operating requirements; scheduled principal and
interest payments on indebtedness; dividend payments; and anticipated
capital expenditures of approximately $85 million for production equipment, 
information systems, repairs and upkeep, and environmental compliance.

Operating activities:  Net cash provided by operating activities was
$195.1 million for 1996, $90.1 million for 1995, and $186.4 million for
1994. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in
1996 compared to 1995 was primarily attributable to decreases in
inventories; moderate decreases (relative to significant decreases in
1995) in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities;
and decreases in accounts and notes receivable. The decrease in
inventories primarily resulted from a higher proportion of shipments
directly to distributors rather than shipments through its satellite
redistribution centers. The moderate decreases in accounts payable and
accrued expenses and other liabilities relative to 1995 reflects the
significant payment of obligations to various suppliers, including
advertising agencies, in 1995. Accounts and notes receivable declined
because sales were lower during the last 12 to 16 days of 1996 than during 
the same period of 1995. CBC's credit terms are generally 12 to 16 days.

The 1995 decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to
lower net income, significantly lower accounts payable and other
liabilities, and increases in accounts and notes receivable and other
assets. The reduction in accounts payable reflects the payment of
obligations to various suppliers, including advertising agencies. Some
of these amounts were particularly high at the end of 1994 due to new
or markedly different supplier relationships, such as the new container
joint venture between CBC and ANC. Other liabilities declined in 1995
primarily due to the payment of obligations for the Lowry site and 1993
restructuring accruals. Accounts and notes receivable increased in 1995
because of an increase in international credit sales, which was
partially offset by decreased receivables from the container joint
venture. Other assets increased primarily due to increased investments
and equity in the container joint ventures.

Investing activities:  During 1996, ACC spent $56.9 million on
investing activities compared to $116.2 million in 1995 and $174.7
million in 1994. Capital expenditures decreased to $64.8 million in
1996 from $145.8 million in 1995 and $160.3 million in 1994. In 1996,
capital expenditures focused on information systems and expansion of
packaging capacity, while 1995 expenditures focused on upgrades and
expansion of Golden-based facilities - particularly bottling capacity.
In 1994, capital expenditures focused on expansion of facilities
(primarily bottling capacity) and the purchase of a brewery in
Zaragoza, Spain. Proceeds from property sales were $8.1 million in
1996, compared to $44.4 million in 1995 and $4.4 million in 1994. The
Company primarily sold distribution rights in 1996. Proceeds from
property sales in 1995 were unusually high because of the sale of the
power plant equipment and support facilities for $22.0 million and
certain bottleline machinery and equipment, under a sale-leaseback
transaction, for $17.0 million. Intangible assets and other items
declined $0.2 million in 1996 compared to increases of $14.8 million in
1995 and $18.7 million in 1994. Purchases of distributorships increased
intangible assets in 1995 and 1994.

Financing activities:  ACC spent $59.3 million on financing activities
during 1996 due primarily to principal payments on its medium-term
notes of $38.0 million, purchases of Class B common stock for $3.0
million, and dividend payments of $19.0 million.

During 1995, the Company generated $31.0 million of cash from financing
activities due to the receipt of $100 million from a private placement
of Senior Notes, which was offset by principal payments on medium-term
notes of $44 million, purchases of Class B common shares of $9.9
million, and dividend payments of $19.1 million.

ACC spent $67.0 million on financing activities in 1994. These
activities included principal repayments on medium-term notes of $50
million and dividend payments of $19.1 million.

Debt obligations:  As of December 29, 1996, ACC had $88 million
outstanding in medium-term notes. With cash on hand, the Company repaid
principal of $38 million on these notes in 1996. Principal payments of
$44 million in 1995 and $50 million in 1994 were funded by a combination 
of cash on hand and borrowings. Fixed interest rates on these notes range 
from 8.63% to 9.05%. Aggregate annual maturities on outstanding notes 
are $17 million in 1997, $31 million in 1998, and $40 million in 1999.

In the third quarter of 1995, ACC completed a $100 million private placement
of Senior Notes at fixed interest rates ranging from 6.76% to 6.95% per 
annum. The repayment schedule is $80 million in 2002 and $20 million in 2005.
The proceeds from this borrowing were used primarily to reduce debt under the
revolving line of credit and to repay principal on the medium-term notes.

The Company's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 21.2% at the end
of 1996, 24.9% at the end of 1995, and 20.6% at the end of 1994.

Revolving line of credit:  In addition to the medium-term notes and the
private placement Senior Notes, the Company has an unsecured, committed
revolving line of credit totaling $144 million. From time to time, this
line of credit is used for working capital requirements and general
corporate purposes. As of December 29, 1996, the full $144 million was
available. For 1996, ACC met the two financial covenants under this
line of credit:  a minimum tangible net worth requirement and a debt-to-
total capitalization requirement.

Hedging activities:  As of December 29, 1996, hedging activities
consisted exclusively of hard currency forward contracts to directly
offset hard currency exposures. These irrevocable contracts eliminated
the risk to financial position and results of operations of changes in
the underlying foreign exchange rate. Any variation in the exchange
rate accruing to the contract would be directly offset by an equal
change in the related obligation. Therefore, after execution of the
contract, variations in exchange rates would not impact the Company's
financial statements. ACC's hedging activities and hard currency
exposures are minimal. The Company does not enter into derivative
financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes.

Stock repurchase plan:  On December 20, 1996, the board of directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million of ACC's outstanding
Class B common stock during 1997. Repurchases will be financed by funds 
generated from operations or short-term borrowings.

OUTLOOK 1997

Following industry pricing trends, CBC raised prices in the first
quarter of 1997 in the majority of its U.S. markets. The increases in
1997 were smaller than those achieved in 1996. Additionally, several
key markets, most notably Texas, did not absorb a 1997 price increase.
CBC continues to be pressured by the industry pricing environment; 1997
price increases are expected to be smaller than those in 1996. There is also 
uncertainty as to the degree to which these increases may be eroded by 
price discounting and the degree to which these increases may impact volume.

International income is expected to be up in 1997 primarily due to the
Company's Canadian business. The Company's interim agreement with Molson,
which expires no earlier than July 1, 1997, provides for greater
earnings to the Company than royalties recognized under the terminated
licensing agreement with Molson. Management continues to work on CBC's
options for future business in Canada.

For fiscal 1997, raw material costs are expected to be up slightly. 
CBC continues to pursue improvements in its operations and technology
functions to deliver cost reductions over time.

Total net interest expense is expected to be lower in 1997 resulting
from CBC's more favorable cash position and its lower outstanding debt
relative to its 1996 financial position. Additional outstanding common
stock may be repurchased in 1997 as approved by the ACC board of
directors in December 1996.

Overall, sales, marketing, and G&A expenses are likely to be up
slightly in 1997. Management continues to monitor CBC's market
opportunities and invest behind its brands and its sales efforts
accordingly. Incremental sales and marketing spending will be
determined on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis.

The effective tax rate for 1997 is not expected to deviate materially
from the 1996 rate.

In 1997, CBC has planned capital expenditures (including contributions
to its container joint ventures for capital improvements) of approximately 
$85 million. In addition to CBC's 1997 capital expenditures, incremental 
strategic investments will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include,
among others, statements concerning the Company's outlook for 1997;
overall and brand-specific volume trends; pricing trends and industry
forces; cost reduction strategies and their results; targeted goals for
return on invested capital; the Company's expectations for funding its
1997 capital expenditures and operations; and other statements of
expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated events
or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not
historical facts. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in or implied by the statements.

To improve its financial performance, the Company must grow premium
beverage volume, achieve modest price increases for its products, and
reduce its overall cost structure. The most important factors that
could influence the achievement of these goals - and cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-
looking statements - include, but are not limited to, the following:

- - the inability of the Company and its distributors to develop and
  execute effective marketing and sales strategies for Coors products;

- - the Company's inability to develop its Canadian business more
  profitably than under previous arrangements;

- - the potential erosion of recent price increases through discounting
  or a higher proportion of sales in multi-packs;

- - a potential shift in consumer preferences toward lower-priced
  products in response to price increases;

- - a potential shift in consumer preferences away from the premium light
  beer category including Coors Light;

- - the intensely competitive, slow-growth nature of the beer industry;

- - demographic trends and social attitudes that can reduce beer sales;

- - the continued growth in the popularity of microbrews and other
  specialty beers;

- - increases in the cost of aluminum, paper packaging, and other raw materials;

- - the Company's inability to reduce manufacturing, freight, and
  overhead costs to more competitive levels;

- - changes in significant government regulations affecting environmental
  compliance, income taxes, and advertising or other marketing efforts
  for the Company's products;

- - increases in federal or state beer excise taxes;

- - increases in rail transportation rates or interruptions of rail service;

- - potential impact of industry consolidation; and

- - risks associated with investments and operations in foreign
  countries, including those related to foreign regulatory
  requirements; exchange rate fluctuations; and local
  political, social, and economic factors.

These and other risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are
discussed in greater detail in this report and in the Company's other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ENVIRONMENTAL

The Company was one of numerous parties named by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) for
the Lowry site, a legally permitted landfill owned by the City and
County of Denver. In 1990, the Company recorded a special pretax charge
of $30 million for potential cleanup costs of the site.

The City and County of Denver; Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.; and
Chemical Waste Management, Inc. brought litigation in 1991 in U.S.
District Court against the Company and 37 other PRPs to determine the
allocation of costs of Lowry site remediation. In 1993, the Court
approved a settlement agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs,
resolving the Company's liabilities for the site. The Company agreed to
initial payments based on an assumed present value of $120 million in
total site remediation costs. Further, the Company agreed to pay a
specified share of costs if total remediation costs exceeded this
amount. The Company remitted its agreed share, based on the $120
million assumption, to a trust for payment of site remediation,
operating, and maintenance costs.

The City and County of Denver; Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.; and
Chemical Waste Management, Inc. are expected to implement site
remediation. The EPA's projected costs to meet the announced
remediation objectives and requirements are below the $120 million
assumption used for ACC's settlement. The Company has no reason to
believe that total remediation costs will result in additional
liability to the Company.

In 1991, the Company filed suit against certain of its former and current 
insurance carriers, seeking recovery of past defense costs and investigation, 
study, and remediation costs. Settlements were reached during 1993 and 1994 
with all defendants, and, as a result, the Company recognized a special 
pretax credit of $18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1994.

From time to time, ACC also is notified that it is or may be a PRP
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws for the cleanup of other
sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the
environment. The Company cannot predict with certainty the total costs
of cleanup, its share of the total cost or the extent to which
contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time
necessary to complete the cleanups, or insurance coverage. However,
based on investigations to date, the Company believes that any
liability would be immaterial to its financial position and results of
operations for these sites. There can be no certainty, however, that
the Company will not be named as a PRP at additional CERCLA sites in
the future, or that the costs associated with those additional sites
will not be material.

While it is impossible to predict the Company's eventual aggregate cost
for environmental and related matters, management believes that any
payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of
time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to the
Company's results of operations or its financial or competitive position. 
The Company believes adequate disclosures have been provided for losses 
that are reasonably possible. Further, as the Company continues to focus 
on resource conservation, waste reduction, and pollution prevention, it 
believes that potential future liabilities will be reduced.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Adolph Coors Company:


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Adolph Coors Company and its subsidiaries at December 29,
1996, and December 31, 1995, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 29, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.

              ADOLPH COORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    
NOTE 1:
    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Adolph Coors Company (ACC),
its principal subsidiary, Coors Brewing Company (CBC), and the
majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
of both ACC and CBC (collectively referred to as "the Company").
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for the
Company's 50% or less owned affiliates over which the Company has
the ability to exercise significant influence (see Note 10). The
Company has other investments which are accounted for at cost.

Nature of operations: The Company is a multinational brewer and
marketer of beer and other malt-based beverages. The vast
majority of the Company's volume is sold in the United States to
independent wholesalers. The Company's international volume is
produced, marketed, and distributed under varying business arrangements 
including export, direct investment, joint ventures, and licensing.

Fiscal year: The fiscal year of the Company is a 52- or 53-week
period ending on the last Sunday in December. Fiscal years for
the financial statements included herein ended December 29, 1996,
a 52-week period; December 31, 1995, a 53-week period; and
December 25, 1994, a 52-week period.

Concentration of credit risk: The majority of the accounts
receivable balances are from malt beverage distributors. The
Company secures substantially all of this credit risk with
purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds,
personal guarantees, and/or letters of credit.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method for substantially all inventories.

Current cost, as determined principally on the first-in, first-
out method, exceeded LIFO cost by $43.1 million and $42.2 million
at December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995, respectively. During
1996 and 1995, total inventory costs and quantities were reduced
resulting in LIFO liquidations, the effects of which were not material.

Properties: Land, buildings, and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method
over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and
improvements, 10 to 45 years; and machinery and equipment, 3 to
20 years. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for
income tax purposes. Expenditures for new facilities and
improvements that substantially extend the capacity or useful
life of an asset are capitalized. Start-up costs associated with
manufacturing facilities, but not related to construction, are expensed 
as incurred. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

The Company continually evaluates its assets to assess their
recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash
flows. Impairment would be recognized in operations if permanent
diminution in value occurs.

Hedging transactions: The Company periodically enters into short-
term forward, future, and option contracts for foreign currency
and commodities to hedge its exposure to exchange rates and price
fluctuations for raw materials and fixed assets used in the
production of beer. The gains and losses on these contracts are
deferred and recognized in cost of sales as part of the product cost.

As of December 29, 1996, hedging activities consisted exclusively
of hard currency forward contracts to directly offset hard
currency exposures. These irrevocable contracts eliminated the
risk to financial position and results of operations of changes
in the underlying foreign exchange rate. Any variation in the
exchange rate accruing to the contract would be directly offset
by an equal change in the related obligation. Therefore, after
the execution of the contract, variations in exchange rates would
not impact the Company's financial statements. The Company's
hedging activities and hard currency exposures are minimal. The
Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculation or trading purposes.

Excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired: The excess
of cost over the net assets of businesses acquired in
transactions accounted for as purchases is being amortized on a
straight-line basis, generally over a 40-year period.

Advertising: Advertising costs, included in marketing, general
and administrative, are expensed when the advertising first takes
place. Advertising expense was $331.9 million, $330.4 million,
and $327.6 million for years 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
The Company had $10.9 million and $8.9 million of prepaid
advertising production costs reported as assets at December 29,
1996, and December 31, 1995, respectively.

Environmental expenditures: Environmental expenditures that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as
appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or
future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded
when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are
probable and the costs can be estimated reasonably.

Net income per common share: Net income per common share is based on the 
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year.

Statement of Cash Flows: The Company defines cash equivalents as
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or
less. The fair value of these investments approximate their
carrying value. The Company's 1995 investment in the Rocky
Mountain Bottle Company was a $16.2 million non-cash transaction
that is not reflected as an investing activity in the Statement
of Cash Flows. Income taxes paid were $13.2 million in 1996,
$15.8 million in 1995, and $31.0 million in 1994.

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 
and 1994 financial statements to conform with the 1996 presentation.

The Internal Revenue Service currently is examining the federal
income tax returns for fiscal years 1991 through 1995. In the
opinion of management, adequate accruals have been provided for
all income tax matters and related interest.

The Company and ACX are parties to a tax sharing agreement that
provides for, among other things, the treatment of tax matters
for periods prior to the distribution of ACX stock and the
assignment of responsibility for adjustments as a result of
audits by taxing authorities and is designed to preserve the
status of the distribution as tax-free (see Note 12).

NOTE 6:

Stock Option, Restricted Stock Award, and Employee Award Plans

At December 29, 1996, the Company has four stock-based
compensation plans, which are described in greater detail below.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option
portion of the plans. Had compensation cost been determined for
the Company's stock option portion of the plans based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent
with the alternative method set forth under FASB Statement No.
123, the Company's net income and earnings per share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

                                                      1996         1995

The weighted-average fair value of options
granted under the 1990 Equity Incentive Plan
during the year is:                                 $   7.21   $   6.21

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1996
and 1995, respectively:  dividend yield of 2.535% and 2.78%;
expected volatility of 26.7% for both years, risk-free interest
rates of 5.74% and 7.93% for the 1990 Plan options, and expected
lives of 10 and nine years for the 1990 Plan options.

1983 Plan:  The 1983 non-qualified Adolph Coors Company Stock
Option Plan, as amended, (the 1983 Plan) provides for options to
be granted at the discretion of the board of directors. These
options expire 10 years from date of grant. No options have been
granted under this plan since 1989. At this time, the board of
directors has decided not to grant additional options under this plan.

A summary of the status of the Company's 1983 Plan as of December
29, 1996, December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994, and changes
during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

712,998 shares, 694,090 shares, and 680,279 shares, respectively.

1990 Plan: The 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan) that
became effective January 1, 1990, as amended, provides for two
types of grants: stock options and restricted stock awards. The
stock options have a term of 10 years with exercise prices equal
to fair market value on the day of the grant. Prior to 1994, one-
third of the stock option grant was vested in each of the three
successive years after the date of grant. Effective January 1,
1994, stock options vest at 10% for each $1 increase in fair
market value of ACC stock from date of grant, with a one-year
holding period, or vest 100% after nine years. Once a portion has
vested, it is not forfeited even if the fair market value drops.

A summary of the status of the Company's 1990 EI Plan as of
December 29, 1996, December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994, and

Common stock reserved for options under the 1990 EI Plan as of
December 29, 1996, December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994 was
3,105,844 shares, 3,650,483 shares, and 1,186,477 shares, respectively.

In 1996, 45,390 shares of restricted stock were issued under the
1990 EI Plan. Vesting in the restricted stock awards is over a
three-year period from the date of grant. The compensation cost
associated with these awards is amortized to expense over the
vesting period. Compensation cost associated with these awards
was immaterial in 1996 and 1995.

1991 Plan: In 1991, the Company adopted the Equity Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (EC Plan). The EC Plan provides
for two grants of the Company's stock: the first grant is
automatic and equals 20% of the director's annual retainer, and
the second grant is elective and covers all or any portion of the
balance of the retainer. A director may elect to receive his
remaining 80% retainer in cash, restricted stock, or any
combination of the two. Grants of stock vest after completion of
the director's annual term. The compensation cost associated with
the EC Plan is amortized over the director's term. Compensation
cost associated with this plan was immaterial in 1996 and 1995.

1995 Supplemental Compensation Plan: In 1995, the Company adopted
a supplemental compensation plan that covers substantially all
its employees. Under the plan, management is allowed to recognize
employee achievements through awards of Coors Stock Units (CSUs)
or cash. CSUs are a measurement component equal to the fair market value 
of the Company's Class B common stock. CSUs have a six-month holding period 
after which the recipient may redeem the CSUs for cash, or, if the holder 
has 100 or more CSUs, shares of the Company's Class B common stock. 
Awards under the plan in 1996 and 1995 were immaterial.

Common stock reserved for this plan as of December 29, 1996, and
December 31, 1995, was 83,707 shares and 84,000 shares, respectively.

NOTE 7:

Employee Retirement Plans

The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans for
the majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of
service and average base compensation levels over a period of
years. Plan assets consist primarily of equity, interest-bearing
investments, and real estate. The Company's funding policy is to
contribute annually not less than the ERISA minimum funding
standards, nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted
for federal income tax purposes. Total expense for all these
plans was $24.8 million in 1996, $22.7 million in 1995, and $29.5
million in 1994. These amounts include the Company's matching for
the savings and investment (thrift) plan of $5.7 million for
1996, $5.7 million for 1995, and $5.8 million for 1994. The
increase in 1996 pension expense versus 1995 was caused primarily
by a decrease in the discount rate (settlement rate) from the
1995 rate of 8.5% to the 1996 rate of 7.25%. The decrease in
pension expense in 1995 versus 1994 was caused primarily by an
increase in the discount rate (settlement rate) from the 1994
rate of 7.25% to the 1995 rate of 8.5%. Pension expense in years
1994 and 1996 were calculated at the same 7.25% discount
(settlement) rate, but expense in 1996 was significantly lower
than 1994 because consistent contributions and strong investment
returns have boosted asset levels, which results in higher
actuarially assumed returns and lower pension expense.

Note that the settlement rates shown in the table were selected
for use at the end of each of the years shown. Actuaries
calculate pension expense annually based on data available at the
beginning of each year, which includes the settlement rate
selected and disclosed at the end of the previous year.

NOTE 8:

Non-Pension Postretirement Benefits

The Company has postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life 
insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The plans are not funded.

The obligation under these plans was determined by the application 
of the terms of medical and life insurance plans, together with relevant 
actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates ranging ratably 
from 10.0% in 1996 to 5.0% in the year 2007. The effect of an annual 1% 
increase in trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation by approximately $1.9 million and $4.7 million in 1996 
and 1995, respectively. The effect of a 1% increase in trend rates also
would have increased the ongoing annual cost by $0.6 million and $0.7 million
in 1996 and 1995, respectively. The discount rate used in determining the 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.75% and 7.25% at 
December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995, respectively.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following:

                                                 For the years ended

Effective November 29, 1995, changes were made to postretirement
life insurance and medical benefits which resulted in a
curtailment gain of $3.3 million and $18.6 million in 1996 and
1995, respectively. The 1996 decrease in plan expense resulted
principally from the curtailment of these benefits.
The status of the postretirement benefit plan was as follows:

NOTE 9:

Special Charges (Credits)

The annual results for 1996 include a pretax net special charge
of $6.3 million which resulted in expense of $0.10 per share
after tax. Second quarter results include a $5.2 million pretax
charge for the ongoing Molson legal proceedings and severance
costs for restructuring the Company's engineering and
construction operations. Results of the third quarter include a
$6.7 million pretax credit for underpaid past royalties and
interest from Molson (net of related legal expenses) and income
from the continuing effect of changes made in payroll-related
practices during 1995. Fourth quarter results include a $7.9
million pretax charge for Molson-related legal expenses, partially 
offset by underpaid past royalties from Molson and the continuing effect 
of changes made in payroll-related practices during 1995.

Fourth quarter results for 1995 include a pretax net special
credit of $15.2 million which resulted in income of $0.24 per
share after tax. The net credit was primarily the result of a
gain for the curtailment of certain postretirement benefits other than 
pensions (see Note 8). Offsetting a portion of this curtailment gain are 
severance charges for limited reductions of the Company's work force.

Fourth quarter results for 1994 include a pretax net special
credit of $13.9 million and resulted in income of $0.22 per share
after tax. Two nonrecurring items contributed to the net credit.
First, the Company reached a settlement with a number of its
insurance carriers which enabled it to recover a portion of the
costs associated with the Lowry Landfill Superfund site. Offsetting this 
was a write-down for impairment of certain distributor assets.

In 1993, the Company restructured certain of its operations. This
restructuring charge and subsequent activity are summarized as follows:

In 1995, CBC and Anchor Glass Container Corporation (Anchor)
formed a 50/50 joint venture to produce glass bottles at the CBC
glass manufacturing facility for sale to CBC and outside
customers. In 1996, Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens)
purchased certain Anchor assets and assumed Anchor's role in the
partnership. The agreement has an initial term of 10 years and
can be extended for additional two-year periods. Under the terms
of the agreement, CBC agreed to contribute machinery, equipment,
and certain personal property with an approximate net book value
of $16.2 million and Owens agreed to contribute technology and
capital, which would be used to modernize and expand the capacity
of the plant. Also under the agreement, CBC agreed to reimburse
certain annual operating costs of the facility and to purchase an
annual quantity of bottles, which together represent a 1997
commitment of approximately $59 million. The expenditures under
this agreement in 1996 and 1995 were approximately $54 million
and $23 million, respectively. Additionally, the companies
entered into another agreement that made Owens a long-term, preferred 
supplier for CBC, satisfying 100% of CBC's other glass requirements.

In 1994, CBC and American National Can Company (ANC) formed a
50/50 joint venture to produce beverage cans and ends at CBC
manufacturing facilities for sale to CBC and outside customers.
The agreement has an initial term of seven years and can be
extended for two additional three-year periods. Additionally, the
agreement requires CBC to purchase 100% of its can and end needs
from the joint venture at contracted unit prices and to pay an
annual fee for certain operating costs. The aggregate amount paid
to the joint venture for cans and ends in 1996 and 1995 was
approximately $217 million and $238 million, respectively. In
1994, the aggregate amount paid to the joint venture for ends was
approximately $31 million. The estimated cost in 1997 under this
agreement for cans and ends is $205 million. Additionally, during
1996, CBC received a $5 million distribution from this joint venture.

Cost investments: CBC invested approximately $22 million in Jinro-
Coors Brewing Company (JCBC) in 1992 for a 33% interest. At that
time and thereafter, it has accounted for this investment under
the cost basis of accounting given that CBC does not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over JCBC and that
CBC's investment in JCBC is considered temporary. This investment
includes a put option, whereby Jinro Limited, the 67% owner of
JCBC guarantees CBC's investment. The put option, which is held
for other than trading purposes, entitles CBC to require Jinro
Limited to purchase CBC's investment at the greater of cost or market value 
in Korean Won through March 1999. JCBC achieved positive operating income 
in 1996 but has not yet been profitable due to debt service costs.

Stock Activity

Common stock: Both classes of common stock have the same rights
and privileges, except for voting, which is the sole right of the
holder of Class A stock.

The revised Colorado Business Corporation Act, which became
effective in July 1994, eliminated the concept of treasury stock
for Colorado corporations. Pursuant to that revision, shares that
were previously classified as treasury shares were restored to
status of "authorized but unissued." This elimination of treasury
stock in the Company's consolidated balance sheets reduced the balances 
of Class B common stock and paid-in capital. At December 31, 1995, the 
Class B common stock was reduced by $2.3 million to a stated value of 
$0.24 per share, and paid-in capital was reduced by $26.6 million.

Activity in the Company's Class A and Class B common stock for
each of the three years ended December 29, 1996, December 31,
1995, and December 25, 1994, is summarized below:

At December 29, 1996, December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994,
25,000,000 shares of $1 par value preferred stock were authorized but unissued.

On December 20, 1996, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of 
up to $40 million of ACC's outstanding Class B common stock during 1997. 
As of March 14, 1997, the Company has repurchased 413,000 shares for 
approximately $8.9 million under this stock repurchase program. Additionally,
subsequent to year end, the Company purchased 150,000 shares of Class B 
common stock for $3.2 million from a director of the Company.

NOTE 12:

Commitments and Contingencies

Molson: On October 18, 1996, an arbitration panel ruled that the
licensing agreement terminated in 1993 when Miller acquired its
ownership interest in Molson. This ruling returns Canadian rights
to all CBC brands to CBC and requires Molson to compensate CBC
for the period beginning April 2, 1993. Although CBC believes the
compensation awarded will be significant, that compensation
cannot be quantified until the next phase of arbitration is
completed during 1997. Accordingly, no such compensation has been
reflected in the 1996 financial statements.

Also in its ruling, the arbitration panel found that Molson had
underpaid royalties from January 1, 1991, to April 1, 1993. Thus,
Molson paid CBC $6.1 million in cash (net of $680,000 of
withholding taxes) during 1996 to cover the unpaid royalties plus
interest. In January 1997, Molson filed an appeal to this phase
of the arbitration. Management believes the appeal is without merit.

CBC and Molson have agreed that Molson will continue to brew and distribute 
CBC's products for an interim period ending no earlier than July 1, 1997. 
Income from the interim agreement is based upon actual CBC brand sales 
volume in Canada and is reported as gross sales in the accompanying 
financial statements.

Insurance: It is the Company's policy to act as a self-insurer
for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of employee
health insurance programs, workers' compensation, and general
liability contract deductibles.

In 1991, the Company became aware that Mutual Benefit Life
Insurance Company (MBLIC) had been placed under the control of
the State of New Jersey. The Company is a holder of several life
insurance policies and annuities through MBLIC. The cash
surrender value under these policies is approximately $7.5
million. Policyholders have been notified that all claims,
benefits, and annuity payments will continue to be paid in full;
however, at this time, policyholders are unable to redeem the
full value of their policies for cash. A moratorium charge would
be applied to policies that are redeemed.

Letters of credit: As of December 29, 1996, the Company has
approximately $5.5 million outstanding in letters of credit with
certain financial institutions. They generally expire within 12
months from the date of issuance, which range from March 1997 to
October 1997. These letters of credit are being maintained as
security for performance on certain insurance policies,
operations of underground storage tanks, and payments of liquor
and duty taxes and energy billings.

Additionally, the product distributor for Coors Japan advances
certain funds to Coors Japan under a contractual arrangement
between the parties. As of December 29, 1996, such advances
totaled approximately $4.3 million.

Power supplies: In 1995, Coors Energy Company (CEC), a subsidiary
of CBC, sold a portion of its coal reserves to Bowie Resources
Ltd. (Bowie). CEC also entered into a 10-year agreement to
purchase 100% of the coal requirements from Bowie. The coal then
is sold to Trigen-Nations Energy Corporation, L.L.L.P. (Trigen).

In September 1995, CBC concluded the sale of its power plant and
support facilities to Trigen. In conjunction with this sale, CBC
agreed to purchase the electricity and steam needed to operate
the brewery's Golden facilities. CBC's financial commitment under
this agreement is divided between a fixed, non-cancelable cost of
approximately $12.5 million for 1997, which adjusts annually for
inflation, and a variable cost, which is generally based on fuel
cost and CBC's electricity and steam use.

ACX Technologies, Inc.: At the end of 1992, the Company
distributed to its shareholders the common stock of ACX. ACX was
formed in late 1992 to own the ceramics, aluminum, packaging, and
technology-based development businesses which were then owned by
ACC. Joseph Coors, Peter H. Coors, and William K. Coors,
directors of both ACC and ACX during 1996, are trustees of one or
more family trusts that collectively own all of ACC's voting
stock and approximately 47% of ACX's common stock. Joseph Coors
resigned as director of ACX in July 1996. ACC and ACX, or their
subsidiaries, have certain business relationships and have
engaged, or proposed to engage, in certain transactions with one
another, as described below.

CBC is a limited partner in a partnership in which a subsidiary
of ACX Technologies, Inc. (ACX) is the general partner. The
partnership owns, develops, operates, and sells certain real
estate previously owned directly by CBC or ACC. Each partner is
obligated to make additional contributions of up to $500,000 upon
call of the general partner. Distributions are allocated equally
between the partners until CBC recovers its investment, and
thereafter 80% to the general partner and 20% to CBC.

When ACX was spun off in 1992, CBC entered into market-based,
long-term supply agreements with certain ACX subsidiaries to
provide CBC packaging, aluminum, and starch products. Under the
packaging supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase all of its
paperboard (including composite packages, labels, and certain can
wrappers) from an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997,
this contract was modified and extended until at least 1999. In
early 1997, ACX's aluminum manufacturing business was sold to a
third party. The aluminum contracts were canceled in 1995. Since
late 1994, ANC has been the purchasing agent for the joint
venture between ANC and CBC and has ordered limited quantities of
can, end, and tab stock from the now-former ACX subsidiary.
Additionally, ANC purchased a small quantity of tab stock for the
joint venture in early 1997. Under the starch supply agreement,
CBC agreed to purchase 100 million pounds of refined corn starch
annually from an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997, this
agreement was renegotiated, at slightly higher rates, and
extended through 1999. CBC's total purchases under these
agreements in 1996 were approximately $145 million. Purchases in
1997 under the packaging and starch supply agreements are
estimated to be approximately $120 million.

Investments: In 1991, CBC entered into an agreement with Colorado
Baseball Partnership 1993, Ltd. for an equity investment and
multiyear signage and advertising package. This commitment,
totaling approximately $30 million, was finalized upon the
awarding of a National League baseball franchise to Colorado in
1991. The initial investment as a limited partner has been paid.
The carrying value of this investment approximates its fair value
at December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995. The recognition of
liability under the multiyear signage and advertising package
began in 1995 with the opening of Coors Field.

Environmental: In 1991, the City and County of Denver, Waste
Management of Colorado, Inc., and Chemical Waste Management, Inc.
brought litigation in U.S. District Court against the Company and
37 other "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) to determine
the allocation of costs of Lowry site remediation. In 1993, the
Court approved a settlement agreement between the Company and the
plaintiffs, resolving the Company's liabilities for the site. The
Company agreed to initial payments based on an assumed present
value of $120 million in total site remediation costs. Further,
the Company agreed to pay a specified share of costs if total
remediation costs exceeded this amount. The Company remitted its
agreed share, based on the $120 million assumption, to a trust
for payment of site remediation, operating, and maintenance
costs. None of these payments were material to the Company's
results of operations or financial position.

The City and County of Denver, Waste Management of Colorado,
Inc., and Chemical Waste Management, Inc. are expected to
implement site remediation. The Environmental Protection Agency's
projected costs to meet the announced remediation objectives and
requirements are below the $120 million assumption used for ACC's
settlement. The Company has no reason to believe that total
remediation costs will result in additional liability to the Company.

In 1991, the Company filed suit against certain of its former and
current insurance carriers, seeking recovery of past defense
costs and investigation, study, and remediation costs.
Settlements were reached during 1993 and 1994 with all defendants, 
and, as a result, the Company recognized a special pretax credit of 
$18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1994 (see Note 9).

Litigation: The Company also is named as defendant in various
actions and proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
In all of these cases, the Company is denying the allegations and
is vigorously defending itself against them and, in some instances, has 
filed counterclaims. Although the eventual outcome of the various 
lawsuits cannot be predicted, it is management's opinion that these 
suits will not result in liabilities that would materially affect the 
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following summarizes selected quarterly financial information
for each of the two years in the period ended December 29, 1996.
During 1996 and 1995, the first, second, and third quarters were
12 weeks. During 1996, the fourth quarter was 12 weeks; during
1995, the fourth quarter was 13 weeks.

In the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1996 and the fourth
quarter of 1995, certain adjustments were made which were of a
normal and recurring nature. As described in Note 9, income in
1996 was decreased by a special pretax charge of $6.3 million, or
$0.10 per share, and income in the fourth quarter of 1995 was increased 
by a special pretax credit of $15.2 million, or $0.24 per share.

(SEC) rules) at March 1, 1997:

CARL L. BARNHILL (Age 48) joined CBC in May 1994 as senior vice
      president of sales. Barnhill brings more than 20 years of

(a) Amounts awarded under the Management Incentive Compensation Program.

(b) In 1996 and 1994, none of the named executives received
perquisites in excess of the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of salary
plus bonus. In 1995, Timothy V. Wolf received perquisites
including moving and relocation expenses of $293,450.

(c) In 1996, 45,390 shares of restricted stock were granted to L.
Don Brown valued at $873,758 on December 29, 1996. The restricted
stock award granted in 1996 to L. Don Brown has a three-year
vesting period from the date of grant and is based on continuous
services during the vesting period. Dividends are paid to the
holder of the grant during the vesting period. Restricted stock
granted in 1993 to Peter H. Coors and W. Leo Kiely III vested in 1996.

No restricted stock grants were made in 1995 or 1994 to any of
the other named executives.

(d) See discussion under Item 11, Part II, for options issued in 1996.

(e) See discussion under Item 11, Part IV, for the long-term incentive plan.

(f) The amounts shown in this column are attributable to the
officer life insurance other than group life, 401(k) plans, and
the excess of fair market value over option price for stock
options exercised in 1996.

Of the named executives, Peter H. Coors receives officer life
insurance provided by the Company until retirement. At the time
of retirement, the  officer's life insurance program terminates
and the salary continuation agreement becomes effective. The
officer's life insurance provides six times the executive base
salary until retirement, at which time the Company becomes the
beneficiary. The Company provides term life insurance for W. Leo
Kiely III, L. Don Brown, and Timothy V. Wolf. The officer's life
insurance provides six times the executive base salary until
retirement when the benefit terminates. The 1996 annual benefit
for each executive for both programs was: William K. Coors -
$16,168; Peter H. Coors - $5,933; W. Leo Kiely III - $4,205; and
Timothy V. Wolf - $2,278.

The Company's 50% match on the first 6% of salary contributed by
the officer to ACC's qualified 401(k) plan was $4,500 for Peter H. Coors; 
$4,500 for W. Leo Kiely III; $3,467 for L. Don Brown; and $4,500 for 
Timothy V. Wolf. Peter H. Coors exercised stock options in 1996. 
See discussion in Item 11, Part III for stock option exercises in 1996.

In response to Code Section 162 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993, the Company appointed a special compensation committee to
approve and monitor performance criteria in certain performance-
based executive compensation plans for 1996.

(a) Grants vest one year from the date of grant and at a rate of
one-tenth for each $1 increment in fair market value (FMV) of the
stock over the exercise price. For example, when the FMV reaches
$23.00, or $19.00 for L. Don Brown, 10% of the grant is vested;
when it reaches $24.00, or $20.00 for L. Don Brown, 20% is
vested; etc... FMV is calculated by averaging the high and low
stock price for each day. Once a portion has vested, it is not
forfeited even if the FMV drops. If not sooner, the grant is 100%
vested after 9 years. At December 29, 1996, the 1996 grants were
0% vested because of the one year vesting requirement; however,
they were 20% vested on January 2, 1997.

    (c) Award of 1/2 restricted shares and 1/2 cash.
    
    
Under the LTIP, payout targets were dependent on cumulative
return on invested capital (ROIC), which is defined as earnings
before interest expense and after tax, divided by debt plus
equity. The LTIP cycle was three years, with any payout at the
beginning of the fourth year. Under the first cycle, the earliest
potential payout was for 1994-1996. There was no payout for the 1994-1996 
plan, as the Company did not achieve the required cumulative ROIC.

Participants elected the form of payout from three options. The
first option was to receive one-half of the payout in cash and
one-half in shares of restricted stock. Restricted shares were
fully vested but were restricted from sale for a period of five
years. The second option allowed the participant to use the cash
portion of payout to purchase discounted shares of stock (based
on 75% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of
payout). Shares purchased under this option were fully vested but
could not be sold for a period of three years. The third option
allowed the participant to elect a percentage (a multiple of 10,
but not more than 100) of the total award amount to be received
in the form of stock options; the number of options to be three
times the total award amount divided by the fair market value of
the stock at the time the participant enters the LTIP. The
options were fully vested and had a 10-year term. The remainder
of the award, if the percentage elected was less than 100%, was
to be awarded one-half in cash and one-half in restricted shares of stock. 
All shares were to receive dividends during the restriction period.

(a) Maximum permissible benefit under ERISA from the qualified
retirement income plan for 1996 was $120,000. Annual compensation
exceeding $150,000 is not considered in computing the maximum
permissible benefit under the qualified plan. The Company has a
non-qualified supplemental retirement plan to provide full
accrued benefits to all employees in excess of IRS maximums.

Annual average compensation covered by the qualified and non-
qualified retirement plans and credited years of service for
individuals named in Item 11(a) are as follows:  William K. Coors
- - $267,891 and 57 years; Peter H. Coors - $483,889 and 25 years;
W. Leo Kiely III - $394,665 and 3 years; L. Don Brown - $424,685
and 1 year; and Timothy V. Wolf - $313,492 and 2 years.

The Company's principal retirement income plan is a defined
benefit plan. The amount of contribution for officers is not
included in the above table since total plan contributions cannot
be readily allocated to individual employees. The Company's most
recent actuarial valuation was as of January 1, 1996, in which
the ratio of plan contributions to total compensation covered by
the plan was approximately 7.5%. Covered compensation is defined
as the total base salary (average of three highest consecutive
years out of the last 10) of employees participating in the plan,
including commissions but excluding bonuses and overtime pay.
Compensation also includes amounts deferred by the individual
under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) and any amounts
deferred into a plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 125.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. An employee with at
least 5 years of vesting service may retire as early as age 55.
Benefits are reduced for early retirement based on an employee's
age and years of service at retirement; however, benefits are not
reduced if: (1) the employee is at least age 62 when payments
commence; or (2) the employee's age plus years of service equal
at least 85 and the employee has worked for CBC at least 25
years. The amount of pension actually accrued under the pension
formula is in the form of a straight life annuity.

In addition to the annual benefit from the qualified retirement
plan, one of the named executives is covered by a salary
continuation agreement. This agreement provides for a lump sum
cash payment to the officer upon normal retirement in an amount
actuarially equivalent in value to 30% of the officer's last
annual base salary, payable for the remainder of the officer's
life, but not less than 10 years. If the officer should die after
age 55, the surviving spouse receives the remaining amount in a
lump sum. The interest rate used in calculating the lump sum is
determined using 80% of the annual average yield of the 10-year
Treasury constant maturities for the month preceding the month of
retirement. Using 1996 eligible salary amounts as representative
of the last annual base salary, the estimated annual benefit upon
normal retirement for Peter H. Coors would be $148,000.

VI. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

The Company adopted the Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (EC Plan) effective May 16, 1991. The EC Plan provides
for two grants of ACC's Class B (non-voting) common stock to non-
employee (NE) directors. The first grant is automatic and equals
20% of the annual retainer. The second grant is elective and
allows the NE directors to take a portion, or all, of the
remaining annual retainer in stock. Amounts of both grants are
determined by the fair market value of the shares on the date of
grant. Shares received under either grant may not be sold or
disposed of before completion of the annual term. The Company
reserved 50,000 shares of stock to be issued under the EC Plan.
The NE directors' annual retainer is $32,000.

In 1996, the NE members of the board of directors were paid 50%
of the $32,000 annual retainer for the 1995-1996 term and 50% of
the $32,000 annual retainer for the 1996-1997 term, as well as
reimbursement of expenses incurred to perform their duties as
directors. Directors who are full-time employees of the Company
receive $15,000 annually. All directors are reimbursed for any
expenses incurred while attending board or committee meetings and
in connection with any other CBC business. In addition, Joseph
Coors, as a director and retired executive officer, is provided
an office, transportation, and secretarial support from CBC.

VII. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS

CBC has no agreements with executives or employees providing
employment for a set period.

Timothy V. Wolf had an agreement providing a guaranteed bonus of
40% of his base salary in 1995. If he is terminated without cause
within the first two years, he would receive 18 months of his
total current annual salary (base plus bonus). This termination
agreement expired February 7, 1997.

L. Don Brown has an agreement providing a guaranteed bonus of 80%
of his base salary in 1996 and 1997. In addition, he received a
$200,000 signing bonus and a $100,000 transitional bonus in 1996.
If he is terminated without cause during the first two years, he would 
receive 12 months of his total current annual salary (base plus bonus).

The standard severance program for officers is one year of base salary 
plus a prorated portion of any earned bonus for the year of severance.

Under the 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan), if there is a change in
ownership of the Company, the options and restricted shares vest immediately.

VIII. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The Compensation Committee of the board of directors has
furnished the following report on executive compensation for CBC.
This report represents the Company's compensation philosophy for
fiscal year 1996. J. Bruce Llewellyn and Wayne R. Sanders served
on the Compensation Committee for all of 1996. Luis G. Nogales
served on the Compensation Committee until May 1996. Pamela
Patsley joined the committee in November 1996.

Overview of compensation strategy for executives: Under the
supervision of the 1996 Compensation Committee of the board of
directors, the Company continued to support the philosophy that
compensation policies, plans, and programs developed must enhance
the profitability of the Company by linking financial incentives
of senior CBC management with the Company's financial performance. Base 
salary philosophy remained the same, and all incentive programs continued 
to focus on increasing shareholder value and profitability.

Annual base salaries were targeted to be competitive with the
median levels found in the external market. The Company tied
incentive compensation plans to superior corporate and business
unit performance. An aggressive posture for base salaries for
senior executives who have accountability for major functions was
continued. Incentive compensation strategies were tied to Company
performance and shareholder return to encourage a greater ROIC
and to increase share price.

The Compensation Committee's compensation strategy for CBC's CEO
and other executive officers consisted of:

- - targeting the aggregate of base salary to the 50th percentile
  of relevant, broadly defined external markets;

- - providing an annual cash incentive award targeted at the 75th
  percentile of the same external markets;

- - providing annual stock grants designed to increase shareholder return; and

- - continuing an LTIP designed to increase ROIC.

Relationship of performance to specific elements of the compensation 
strategy: Following are brief descriptions that outline details and 
performance measures of each component of the 1996 executive compensation 
strategy.

Base salary: The Company used compensation survey data to
determine salaries competitive at the 50th percentile for like
positions in similar-sized manufacturing companies. Company size
was determined by total net sales.

Salary ranges were established for executives by using the 50th
percentile market data as the midpoint, with a 50% spread between
minimum and maximum. Where the executive was paid within the
range was determined by individual performance.

Annual cash incentive award: In 1996, the annual Management
Incentive Award program continued with the intent to drive both
Company profitability and individual performance. Executive
officers and other key management personnel were measured based
on pretax profit and written individual performance plans tied to
CBC objectives. Payout may occur only after profit objectives are
realized. The Compensation Committee approved annual pretax
profit objectives as well as minimum and maximum payout levels
within the program. There was no payout under the cash incentive
award program in 1996. However, the board approved a special
bonus, paid in restricted stock, to recognize superior
performance by select participants in the plan.

Annual stock option grants: In 1996, the Committee approved
granting of stock options to the executive officers and to other
key management personnel. Options were granted as a percentage of
base salary and based on the individual's level in the
organization. Options were granted with a 10-year term. Option
vesting is based on a one-year holding period and an increase in
share value. Options vest 10% for each $1 increase in fair market
value. All options vest after nine years regardless of share
value increase. Options were granted through the 1990 Equity
Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan).

The 1990 EI Plan was administered by the Compensation Committee.
That committee was composed of NE, independent directors. The
1990 EI Plan provides that options be granted at exercise prices
equal to the fair market value on the date the option was granted.

Long-term incentive plan: The LTIP was canceled by the board of
directors at the November 1996 board meeting. During 1996, there
were two cycles in effect. See discussion under Item 11, Part IV,
for a description of this plan.

CEO compensation for 1996: The CEO's compensation for 1996 did
not reflect any of the incentive elements of the Company's
compensation strategy. While fully supportive of the executive
compensation strategy and fully committed to the Company goal of
improved profitability and an increase in shareholder value, CEO
William K. Coors has elected not to participate in the incentive
programs. It is Mr. Coors' belief that his compensation, although
low relative to market and industry standards, is adequate to
support his needs and that, given his strong commitment to
corporate goals and objectives, financial incentives would not
enhance his motivation to achieve superior performance. Mr. Coors
did, however, receive a minimal 2.0% increase in base salary.

IX. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

J. Bruce Llewellyn, Luis G. Nogales, Pamela H. Patsley, and Wayne
R. Sanders served on the Compensation Committee during 1996.

Joseph Coors and William K. Coors, directors of both ACC and ACX
during 1996, along with Peter H. Coors, are trustees of one or
more family trusts that collectively own all of ACC's voting
stock and approximately 47% of ACX's common stock (see Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management in Item
12). Joseph Coors resigned as director of ACX in July 1996. ACC
and ACX, or their subsidiaries, have certain business
relationships and have engaged or proposed to engage in certain
transactions with one another, as described below.

When ACX was spun off in 1992, CBC entered into market-based,
long-term supply agreements with certain ACX subsidiaries to
provide CBC packaging, aluminum, and starch products. Under the
packaging supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase all of its
paperboard (including composite packages, labels, and certain can
wrappers) from an ACX subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997,
this contract was modified and extended until at least 1999. In
early 1997, ACX's aluminum manufacturing business was sold to a
third party. The aluminum contracts were canceled in 1995. Since
late 1994, American National Can Company (ANC) has been the
purchasing agent for the joint venture between ANC and CBC and
has ordered limited quantities of can, end, and tab stock from
the now-former ACX subsidiary. Additionally, ANC purchased a
small quantity of tab stock for the joint venture in early 1997.
Under the starch supply agreement, CBC agreed to purchase 100
million pounds of refined corn starch annually from an ACX
subsidiary through 1997. In early 1997, this agreement was
renegotiated, at slightly higher rates, and extended through
1999. CBC's total purchases under these agreements in 1996 were
approximately $145 million. Purchases in 1997 under the packaging and 
starch supply agreements are estimated to be approximately $120 million.

CBC sold small quantities of aluminum scrap to the now-former ACX
subsidiary in the amount of $240,000. CBC also agreed to sell
brewery by-products to an ACX subsidiary for resale under a
contract through 1997. In early 1997, this agreement was extended
through 1999. CBC received approximately $10 million in 1996
under this contract and estimates that 1997 receipts will be
approximately $10 million.

Also with the spin-off, ACC, ACX, and their subsidiaries
negotiated other agreements involving employee matters,
environmental management, tax sharing, and trademark licensing.
These agreements govern certain relationships between the
parties, as described in the Company's report on Form 8-K dated
December 27, 1992, and contained in the information statement
mailed to ACC's shareholders at the time of the spin-off.

Certain ACC and ACX subsidiaries are parties to other
miscellaneous market-based transactions. In 1996, CBC provided
water and waste water treatment services to an ACX ceramics
facility located on property leased from CBC, CBC purchased some
ceramic tooling from an ACX subsidiary, and CBC received real
estate management and other services from the ACX real estate
brokerage subsidiary through the summer of 1996. During 1996, CBC
received approximately $310,000 in total and paid approximately
$370,000 in total under these agreements and transactions. In
1997, CBC expects to pay $70,000 and receive $370,000 under these
agreements and transactions.

CBC is a limited partner in a partnership in which an ACX
subsidiary is the general partner. The partnership, which was
formed at the time of the spin-off, owns, develops, operates, and
sells certain real estate previously owned directly by CBC or
ACC. Distributions of $1.5 million were made to both partners in
1996. Each partner is obligated to make additional cash
contributions of $500,000 upon call of the general partner.
Distributions are allocated equally between the partners until
CBC recovers its investment, and thereafter 80% to the general
partner and 20% to CBC.

(a)  William K. Coors and Peter H. Coors are two of the trustees
of the Adolph Coors Foundation, which owns 732,413 shares of
Class B common stock. William K. Coors, Joseph Coors, and Peter
H. Coors are trustees, in addition to other trustees and
beneficiaries, or contingent beneficiaries in certain cases, of
various trusts that own an aggregate of 16,737,111 shares of
Class B common stock. These individuals, and others, are trustees
of three other trusts owning 267,100 shares of Class B common
stock. In certain of these trusts, they act solely as trustees
and have no vested or contingent benefits. The total of these
trust shares, together with other management shares shown above,
represents 51% of the total number of shares of such class outstanding.

(b) This column represents exercisable options to purchase shares
under the Company's 1983 non-qualified Adolph Coors Company Stock
Option Plan and 1990 EI Plan (as amended in 1995) that could be
exercised as of March 15, 1997. It reflects restricted stock
awards granted under the 1990 EI Plan. Vesting in the restricted
stock is over a three-year period from date of grant for
employee/officers and at the end of the term for outside
directors. In the event of a change in control of the Company,
the options and restricted shares vest immediately. It also
reflects a special restricted stock award made in February 1997.
This restricted stock has a one-year vesting period.

(c)  Changes in Control

There are no arrangements that would later result in a change of
control of the Company.

ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

(a)  Transactions with Management and Others

There were no transactions that exceeded $60,000 with management
or others related to the Company.

(b)  Certain Business Relationships

For a description of certain business relationships and related
transactions, see the discussion within Compensation Committee
Interlocks and Insider Participation in Item 11.

(c)  Indebtedness of Management

Employee loans are made with the exercise of stock options
granted under the 1983 non-qualified Adolph Coors Company Stock
Option Plan. No such loans were made or outstanding in 1996.

No member of management or another with a direct or indirect
interest in ACC was indebted to the Company in excess of $60,000 in 1996.

Other Matters

To comply with the July 13, 1990, amendments governing Form S-8
under the Securities Act of 1933, ACC offers as follows, which is
incorporated by reference into ACC's Registration Statements on
Form S-8 No. 33-2761 (filed January 17, 1986); No. 33-35035
(filed May 24, 1990); No. 33-40730 (filed May 21, 1991); and No.
33-59979 (filed June 6, 1995); and on Form S-3 No. 33-33831
(filed March 14, 1990):

Even though ACC could indemnify its directors, officers, and
controlling persons for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 under SEC regulations, the SEC has indicated that
such indemnification is against public policy and unenforceable.
If a director, officer, or controlling person requests indemnification 
for liabilities arising from securities being registered (other than for 
reimbursements of amounts paid for the successful defense of any lawsuit), 
ACC will ask a court if such indemnification is against public policy 
and will follow that court's ruling.
