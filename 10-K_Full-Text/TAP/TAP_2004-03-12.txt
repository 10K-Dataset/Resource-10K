INDEX


PART I

ITEM 1. Description of Business.

Unless otherwise noted in this report, any
description of us includes Adolph Coors Company (ACC), principally a holding
company, its operating subsidiaries, Coors Brewing Company (CBC), operating in
the United States (US); and Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating in the
United Kingdom (UK); and our other corporate entities.

(a)  General Development of Business

Global
Expansion

Since
our founding in 1873, we have been committed to producing the highest-quality
beers. Our portfolio of brands is designed to appeal to a wide range of
consumer tastes, styles and price preferences. Until our acquisition of CBL in
February 2002, we operated and sold our beverages predominately in North
America and in select international markets. The CBL acquisition expanded our
international presence to include significant operations and sales in the
United Kingdom.

Joint
Ventures and Other Arrangements

To sharpen focus on our core competencies in
manufacturing, marketing and selling malt beverage products, we have entered
into various arrangements with third parties over the past decade to leverage
their strengths in areas like can and bottle manufacturing, transportation,
packaging, engineering, energy production and information technology.

Our
Products

We own or license all of our trademarks for
all of our brands. Brands sold primarily in the Americas include: Coors Light®,
Coors Original®, Coors® Non-Alcoholic, Extra Gold®, Zima®, George Killian’s®
Irish Red

TM

Lager,

Keystone®, Keystone Light®, Keystone
Ice®, Blue Moon

TM

Belgian White Ale and Mexicali®. We also sell the
Molson family of brands in the United States through a joint venture. Brands
sold primarily through CBL include: Carling®, Worthington®, Caffrey’s®, Reef®,
Screamers

TM

and Stones®. We also sell Grolsch® in the United Kingdom
through a joint venture.

In the United Kingdom in 2003, we achieved considerable
success with the continued roll-out of Carling Extra Cold, which is dispensed
at on-trade locations (pubs, clubs, restaurants and hotels) at two degrees
centigrade, four degrees cooler than traditional English draft lagers.
Additionally, in the last quarter of the year, we introduced Coors Fine Light
Beer to the on-trade channel. In January 2004, we launched this beer into
the off-trade channel (retail and wholesale) and commenced television
advertising for the product.  In the
United States in 2004, we plan to introduce a low-carb beer called Aspen Edge

TM

, and a variety of new flavored Zima products,
collectively called Zima XXX

TM

(in select US markets).

In the United Kingdom, in addition to supplying our own
brands, we sell other beverage companies’ brands to our on-premise customers so
as to be able to provide them with a full range of products for their retail
outlets. These factored brand sales are included in our financial results,
increasing our net sales and cost of goods sold, but the related volume is not
included in our reported sales volumes.

(b)  Financial Information About Segments

Prior to our acquisition of CBL, we reported results of operations in
one segment. We now categorize our operations into two operating segments: the
Americas and Europe. These segments are managed by separate operating teams,
even though both segments consist of the manufacture, marketing, and sale of
beer and other beverage products.

See Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for financial information relating to our segments and
operations, including geographic information.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Some of the following statements may describe
our expectations of future products and business plans, financial results,
performance and events. Actual results may differ materially from these
forward-looking statements. Please see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis – Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of


the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, for factors that may negatively impact our performance. The following
statements are expressly made, subject to those and other risk factors.

We sold approximately 68% of our 2003 reported volume in the Americas
segment and 32% in the Europe segment. In 2003, Coors Light accounted for about
51% of reported volume and Carling for approximately 22%.

Our sales volume totaled 32.7 million barrels in 2003, compared to 31.8
million barrels in 2002 and 22.7 million barrels in 2001. The barrel sales
figures for each year do not include barrel sales of our products sold in
Canada by the non-consolidated Coors Canada Partnership (Coors Canada) or
volume from our joint venture with Molson sold in the United States. An
additional 1.5 million, 1.4 million and 1.3 million barrels of beer were sold
by Coors Canada in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our Molson venture sold
0.9, 0.9 and 0.8 million barrels in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our
sales volumes also do not include the CBL factored brands business. See Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis,
for a discussion of volume changes.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated or
segmented sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Americas Segment

The Americas business segment is focused on the production, marketing
and sales of the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories.
This segment also includes the Coors Light business in Canada that is conducted
through a partnership investment with Molson, Inc. (Molson) and the sale
of Molson products in the United States that is conducted through a joint
venture investment (Molson USA) with Molson. The Americas segment also includes
a small amount of volume that is sold outside of the United States and its
territories.

Sales and Distribution

United States

In the United States, beer is generally distributed through a three-tier
system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. A national
network of 472 independent distributors (537 including branch locations)
purchases our products and distributes them to retail accounts. We also own
three distributorships that handled less than 3% of our total domestic volume
in 2003, and we sell Molson branded beers through our Molson USA joint venture
which utilizes additional independent distributors.

Canada

Coors
Canada is our partnership with Molson that manages all marketing activities for
our products in Canada. We own 50.1% of this partnership, and Molson owns
49.9%. The partnership contracts with 
Molson for the brewing, distribution and sale of our products. Coors
Light currently has an 8.7% market share, and is the largest-selling light beer
and the 4

th

-best selling beer brand overall in Canada.

Puerto Rico and the Caribbean

In Puerto Rico, we market and sell Coors Light through an independent
distributor. A team of our employees manages the marketing and promotional
efforts in this market, where Coors Light is the number-one brand. We also sell
our products in a number of other Caribbean markets, including the US Virgin
Islands, through local distributors.

Asia

We have small developing markets in Japan, China and Taiwan. The
Japanese business is currently focused on Zima and Coors Original and we sell
Coors Light in Taiwan. We sell Coors Light and Coors Original in China and have
contracted with Lion Nathan for the production of finished goods for the
Japanese and Chinese markets.

Manufacturing, Production and Packaging in the United States

Brewing Raw Materials

We use the highest quality water, barley and hops to brew our products.
The majority of the water we use is naturally filtered from underground
aquifers. We have acquired water rights to provide for long-term strategic
growth and to sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought. We buy
barley under long-term contracts from a network of independent farmers located
in five western US states.


Brewing and Packaging Facilities

We have three domestic production facilities and one small brewery
located in Mexico. We own and operate the world’s largest single-site brewery
located in Golden, Colorado. In addition, we own and operate a packaging and
brewing facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and a packaging facility located in the
Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. We brew Coors Light, Coors Original, Extra Gold,
Killian’s and the Keystone brands in Golden, and package about 60% of the beer
brewed in Golden. The remainder is shipped in bulk from the Golden brewery to
either our Memphis or Shenandoah facility for packaging.

Packaging Materials

Aluminum Cans

Approximately 59% of our domestic products were packaged in aluminum
cans in 2003. A substantial portion of those cans were purchased from a joint
venture with Ball Corporation (Ball), Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC
(RMMC). In addition to our supply agreement with RMMC, we also have commercial
supply agreements with Ball and other third-party can manufacturers to purchase
cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through RMMC. In 2003, we purchased
the significant majority of the cans and ends produced by the RMMC facilities.

Glass Bottles

We used glass bottles for approximately 29% of our products in
2003.  We operate a joint venture with
Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens), the Rocky Mountain Bottle Company
(RMBC), to produce glass bottles at our glass manufacturing facility. On
July 29, 2003, we signed a new agreement, effective for 12 years beginning
August 1, 2003, with Owens extending this joint venture, as well as a
supply agreement with Owens for the glass bottles we require in excess of joint
venture production.

Other Packaging

Most of the remaining 12% of volume we sold in 2003 was packaged in
quarter and half-barrel stainless steel kegs.

We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging from a
subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. These
products include paperboard, multi-can pack wrappers, bottle labels and other
secondary packaging supplies.

Seasonality of the Business

Our US sales volumes are normally lowest in the first and fourth
quarters and highest in the second and third quarters.

Competitive Conditions

Known
Trends and Competitive Conditions

Industry and competitive information in this section and elsewhere
in this report was compiled from various industry sources, including beverage
analyst reports (

Beer Marketer’s Insights,
Impact Databank and The Beer Institute)

. While management believes
that these sources are reliable, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of these
numbers and estimates.

2003 Americas Beer Industry Overview

The beer industry in the United States is extremely competitive, with
three major brewers controlling about 80% of the market. Therefore, growing or
even maintaining market share requires substantial and perhaps increasing
investments in marketing and sales efforts. US beer industry shipments had an
annual growth rate during the past 10 years of less than 1%. The industry’s
pricing environment continued to be positive in 2003, with modest price
increases on specific brands and packages in select markets.

Two major trends impacted the US beer market in 2003. First, overall US
beer shipments declined for the first time since 1995, driven by a weak
national economy, unusually cool weather in many regions of the country, and
the war in Iraq.  The net effect of all
these factors was a decline in the US beer industry sales of about 1% during
2003 from the year before. The second industry trend was the growth in beers
with low-carbohydrate positioning. Because none of our brands was positioned as
low-carbohydrate last year, both of these industry trends negatively impacted
our volume in 2003.


The US brewing industry has experienced significant consolidation in
the past several years, which has removed excess production capacity. In 2003,
beer industry consolidation at the wholesaler level continued. This
consolidation generally improves business economics for these combined
wholesalers.

Over
the past several years, the Canadian beer industry volume has been effectively
flat with growth of less than 1% in 2003. 
The industry’s pricing environment continued to be positive in 2003,
with  price increases in several markets
across the country.

The
beer market in Puerto Rico had extraordinary growth in the 70s and 80s. Since
then, the market has experienced periodic growth and decline cycles. This
market has traditionally been split between local brewers, US imports, and
other imports. In mid 2002, Puerto Rico implemented a 50% excise tax increase.
This tax increase contributed to a 10% contraction in total beer consumption
and disproportionately affected imports, since the most significant local brand
was exempt from the tax. Coors Light is the market leader in Puerto Rico with
an approximate 50% market share.

Our
Competitive Position

Our malt beverages compete with numerous above-premium, premium,
low-calorie, popular-priced, non-alcoholic and imported brands. These competing
brands are produced by national, regional, local and international brewers. We
compete most directly with Anheuser-Busch (AB) and SABMiller (Miller), the
dominant beer companies in the US industry. According to

Beer Marketer’s Insights

estimates, we are the nation’s third-largest brewer, selling approximately 11%
of the total 2003 US brewing industry shipments (including exports and US
shipments of imports). This compares to AB’s 50% share and Miller’s 18% share.

Europe Segment

The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL
brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement
relating to the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom
and Republic of Ireland, and our joint venture arrangement with Tradeteam for
the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain.

CBL has headquarters in Burton-on-Trent, England, and is the United
Kingdom’s second-largest beer company with unit volume sales of approximately
10.3 million US barrels in 2003. CBL holds approximately 20% of the UK beer
market, Western Europe’s second-largest market. The CBL sales are primarily in
England and Wales, with the Carling brand (a mainstream lager) representing
approximately two-thirds of CBL’s total beer volume.

Sales and Distribution

Over the past three decades, volumes have begun to shift from the
on-trade channel, where products are consumed “on-premise,” to the off-trade
channel, also referred to as the “take-home” market. Revenue per barrel in the
on-trade channel tends to be higher, but the off-trade channel can offer
similar returns to brewers because selling, servicing and distribution costs
are generally lower. Unlike the United States, where manufacturers are
generally not permitted to distribute beer directly to retail, the large
majority of our beer in the United Kingdom is sold directly to retailers.

Distribution activities for CBL are conducted by Tradeteam, which operates
a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet. Tradeteam also
manages the transportation of certain raw materials such as malt to the CBL
breweries.

On-trade

The on-trade channel accounted for approximately 64% of our UK sales
volumes in 2003. The installation and maintenance of draught beer dispense
equipment in the on-trade channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer
in the United Kingdom. CBL retains ownership of equipment required to dispense
beer from kegs to consumers. This includes beer lines, line cooling, taps and
countermounts.


Similar to other UK brewers, CBL has traditionally used loans to secure
supply relationships with customers in the on-trade market. Loans have been
granted at below-market rates of interest, with the outlet purchasing beer at
lower-than-average discount levels to compensate. Such loans are typically
secured by a proprietary interest in the borrower’s property. We reclassify a
portion of sales revenue to interest income to reflect the economic substance
of these loans.

Off-trade

The off-trade channel accounted for approximately 36% of our UK sales
volume in 2003, up 2% from 2002. The off-trade market includes sales to
supermarket chains, convenience stores, liquor store chains, distributors and
wholesalers.

Manufacturing, Production
and Packaging

Brewing Raw
Materials

We use the highest quality water, barley and hops to brew our products.
Water for our three UK breweries, located in Burton-on-Trent, Alton and
Tadcaster, comes from dedicated supplies, filtered through the local
underground aquifers. Barley for CBL brewing operations is high quality two-row
seed grown exclusively in England to strict standards. We believe we have
sufficient access to raw materials to meet our quality and production
requirements.

Brewing and
Packaging Facilities

We operate three breweries in the United Kingdom. The Burton-on-Trent
brewery, located in the Midlands, is the largest brewery in the United Kingdom.
Other smaller breweries are located in Tadcaster and Alton.

Packaging Materials

Kegs

We used kegs and casks for approximately 61% of our UK product in 2003.
We purchase our kegs and casks through supply contracts with third-party
suppliers. The high level of volume packaged in kegs and casks contrasts with
the Americas business, and reflects a higher percentage of product sold
on-premise.

Cans

Approximately 31% of our products were packaged in cans in 2003.
Virtually all of our cans were purchased through supply contracts with Ball.

Other Packaging

The remaining 8% of our product is primarily packaged in glass bottles
purchased through supply contracts with third-party suppliers.

Seasonality of Business

In Great Britain, the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales
fluctuation primarily influenced by holiday periods, weather and by certain
major televised sporting events. There is a peak during the summer and during
the Christmas and New Year period. The holiday peak is most pronounced in the
off-trade channel. Consequently, our largest quarters are the third and fourth
quarters, and the smallest are the first and second.

Competitive Conditions

2003 UK Beer
Industry Overview

Beer consumption in the United Kingdom has been in long-term decline
since 1980, falling by an average of 0.8% per annum. This decline has been
mainly attributable to the on-trade channel, where volumes are now 40% lower
than in 1980. Over the same period, off-trade volume has increased by 278%.
This trend is expected to continue and has been influenced by a number of
factors, including the increasing price difference between beer in the on- and
off-trade channels and changes in consumers’ lifestyles. 2003 represented a
continuation of these trends with off-trade market growth of 7.4% and a decline
in the on-trade market of 2.7%, with the off-trade now representing one third
of the market. The total UK beer market grew 1.1% in 2003, which represented
the third consecutive year of growth, a contributing factor to this growth in
2003 being the unusually hot summer weather.


As well as the on- to off-trade mix shift, there has been a steady
trend toward lager at the expense of ales, driven predominantly by the leading
mainstream and premium lager brands. In 1980, lagers accounted for 31% of beer
sales, and in 2003 lagers accounted for nearly 70%, up from 67% in 2002. While
lager volume has been growing at an average compound annual growth rate of 2.3%
over the last five years, ales, including stouts, have declined by over 10% per
year during this period. This trend has accelerated in the last two years. The
leading beer brands are generally growing at a faster rate than the market. The
top 10 brands now represent approximately 60% of the total market, compared to
only 34% in 1994.

Our
Competitive Position

Our beers and flavored alcohol beverages compete not only with similar
products from competitors, but also with other alcohol beverages, including
wines and spirits. With the exception of stout, where we do not have our own
brand, our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer
categories. Our strength in the growing lager sector with Carling and Grolsch
makes us well positioned to take advantage of the continuing trend away from
ales to lagers.

Our principal competitors are Scottish Courage Ltd., Interbrew UK Ltd.
and Carlsberg-Tetley Ltd. We are the United Kingdom’s second-largest brewer,
with an approximate 20% market share (excluding factored brands sales), based on
AC Nielsen information. This compares to Scottish Courage Ltd.’s share of 25%,
Interbrew UK Ltd.’s 19% share (excluding Heineken brands, which are no longer
part of Interbrew’s brand portfolio) and Carlsberg-Tetley Ltd.’s 13% share. Our
core brands – Carling, Grolsch, Worthington’s and Reef – all increased their
product sector share in 2003.

Intellectual Property

We own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce and we have
licenses for the remainder. We also hold several patents on innovative processes
related to product formula, can making, can decorating and certain other
technical operations. These patents have expiration dates ranging through 2021.
These expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our
business.

Regulation

Americas

Our business in the United States and its territories is highly
regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern
many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising,
transportation, distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. To
operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses
and approvals from various governmental agencies, including the US Treasury
Department; Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly called the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms); the US Department of Agriculture; the
US Food and Drug Administration; state alcohol regulatory agencies as well as
state and federal environmental agencies. Internationally, our business is also
subject to regulations and restrictions imposed by the laws of the foreign
jurisdictions where we sell our products.

Governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. US federal excise taxes on
malt beverages are currently $18 per barrel. State excise taxes also are levied
at rates that ranged in 2003 from a high of $28.52 per barrel in Hawaii to a
low of $0.62 per barrel in Wyoming. In 2003, we incurred approximately $404
million in federal and state excise taxes in the Americas segment on revenues
of approximately $2.8 billion, or approximately $18 per barrel.

Europe

In the United Kingdom, regulations apply to many parts of our
operations and products, including brewing; food safety; labeling and
packaging; marketing and advertising; environmental; health and safety;
employment; and data protection regulations. To operate our breweries and carry
on business in the United Kingdom, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits
and licenses from local Licensing Justices and governmental bodies; including
HM Customs & Excise, the Office of Fair Trading, the Data Protection
Commissioner and the Environment Agency.

The UK government levies excise taxes on all alcohol beverages at
varying rates depending on the type of product and its alcohol by volume. In
2003, we incurred approximately $983 million in excise taxes on gross revenues
of approximately $2.6 billion, or approximately $94 per barrel.


Environmental Matters

Americas

We are one of a number of entities named by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party
(PRP) at the Lowry Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and
County of Denver (Denver), and is managed by Waste Management of
Colorado, Inc. (Waste Management). In 1990, we recorded a pretax charge of
$30 million, a portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a
settlement with Denver and Waste Management regarding the then outstanding
litigation. Our settlement was based on an assumed cost of $120 million (in
1992 adjusted dollars).  It requires us
to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount.

Considering uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial
actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies, and what costs are
included in the determination of when the $120 million threshold is
reached, the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. We
cannot predict the amount of any such change, but additional accruals could be
required in the future.

We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in
Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may
also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware.

From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a PRP
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances
have allegedly been released into the environment. While we cannot predict our
eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we
may be or are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required,
for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not
be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows or our
financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been
provided for losses that are probable and estimable.

Europe

We are subject to the requirements of government and local
environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
Compliance with these laws and regulations did not materially affect our 2003
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not
anticipate that they will do so in 2004.

Employees and Employee
Relations

Americas

We have approximately 5,400 employees in our Americas business. Memphis
hourly employees, who constitute about 5% of our Americas work force, are
represented by the Teamsters union; and a small number of other employees are
represented by other unions. The Memphis union contract expires in 2005. We
believe that relations with our Americas employees are good.

Europe

We have approximately 3,100 employees
in our Europe business. Approximately 31% of this total workforce is
represented by trade unions, primarily at our Burton-on-Trent and Tadcaster
breweries. Separate negotiated agreements are in place with the Transport and
General Workers Union at the Tadcaster Brewery and the Burton-on-Trent Brewery.
The agreements do not have expiration dates, and negotiations are conducted
annually. We believe that relations with our European employees are good.

(d) Financial
Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for discussion
of sales, operating income and identifiable assets attributable to our country
of domicile, the United States, and all foreign countries.

(e) Available
Information

Our internet website is http://www.coors.com.
Through a direct link to our reports at the SEC’s website at
http://www.sec.gov, we make available, free of charge on our website, our
annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the SEC.


ITEM 2. Properties

As of December 28, 2003, our major facilities were:

We believe our facilities are well maintained and suitable for their
respective operations. Our operating facilities are not constrained by capacity
issues. Our satellite warehouses are owned and operated by third parties.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

We are involved in certain disputes and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of our business.  While
it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in
our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, none of these disputes and
legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial or other position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these matters, including the
advertising practices case described below, could arise that may harm our
business (see Item 8, Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies for additional
discussion of our Legal Contingencies).

Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have
been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage
consumption. The suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege
that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to “children and other
underage consumers.” In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined
class of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages.  We will vigorously defend this litigation
and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss, if any, in these lawsuits.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of
Security Holders

On October 3, 2003, at a special meeting of our shareholders,
Class A and Class B shareholders voted to approve a proposal that resulted in a
change of our state of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware. The change was
made in order to take advantage of Delaware’s comprehensive, widely used and
extensively interpreted corporate law. The re-incorporation did not result in
any change in our name, headquarters, business, jobs, management, location of
offices or facilities, number of employees, taxes payable to the State of
Colorado, assets, liabilities, or net worth. However, the par value of all our
classes of stock is now $0.01 per share, effective as of the fourth quarter of
2003.

ITEM
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Executive Summary

Overall, 2003 was a difficult
year for us, especially in the US We faced extremely soft industry demand
throughout the year in the US, and, although we made significant progress in
key areas of our business, our Americas segment profits came in only slightly
above our prior year results.

The US beer industry faced
many challenges in 2003, including:

•

Continued
weakness in the US economy during 2003 and, specifically, high unemployment
levels among the key 21-24-year-old male consumer population,

•

Unfavorable
weather, particularly in the Northeast, for a significant part of the peak
summer selling season,

•

The
popularity of low-carbohydrate diets that softened demand for beer,

•

The
rise in popularity of distilled spirits and other alternative beverages,
particularly among 21-29-year olds, and

•

A
protracted grocery store strike in California that likely impacted sales in the
largest beer state.

Two additional issues were
unique to our US business during 2003. 
First, we did not offer a product with “low-carbohydrate” positioning.  Second, late in the year, when most of the
industry was showing signs of recovery, we experienced significant
product-supply problems that left us unable to meet all the needs of our
wholesale and retail customers.  We are
addressing these issues early in 2004 in order to optimize our supply chain
systems capabilities.

Our 2003 performance in the
Europe segment, specifically in the UK, reflected strong volume and market
share growth.  Results were negatively
impacted by the lack of benefits in 2003 from revenue-producing transitional
activities which occurred in 2002 following our acquisition of the UK business,
as well as high levels of discounting in the off-Trade channel during the first
two-thirds of the year.  Later in the
year, however, our performance in the UK showed the positive profit impact of
our strong volume growth, reduced off-Trade discounting levels, and
productivity improvements from supply chain initiatives.

•

One
critical area of accomplishment in 2003 was our cash generation and debt
reduction. Full-year debt repayments totaled $272 million, more than 30%
greater than the $208 million we repaid in 2002.  Cash flow during the year benefited from higher operating cash
flow, a temporary reduction in cash taxes, improvements in working capital, and
continually improving capital spending disciplines in the US  Those are the key highlights for 2003.
Looking forward, we have four major strategies we’re focused on to succeed in
the global beer industry: First, we are
striving to capture an increasing share of each new generation of
legal-drinking-age beer drinkers in order to gain their brand loyalty for the
long-term.  We intend to accomplish this
by building our big brands in big markets – Coors Light in the Americas,
Carling and Grolsch in the UK — which are the young-adult beer drinker’s point
of entry into our portfolio.  To achieve
this goal, we continued during 2003 to refine our sales and marketing
initiatives supporting our flagship brands. 
As a result, volume momentum in the UK behind Carling and Grolsch has
been outstanding.  In Canada, Coors
Light has continued to grow volume and market share.Despite a poor volume year
in the US, we’ve made progress among key demographics and retail channels, and
we are taking steps to make all of our initiatives even more effective.

•

Second,
we intend to capture more than our fair share of the product news opportunities
in the category each year through both new products and brands, or product
developments with existing brands, such as Coors Light and Carling.  In March 2004, we launched Aspen Edge – our
entry in the low-carb segment here in the US. 
We are also repositioning Zima in the US, continuing to expand Carling
Extra Cold in the UK, and launching our Coors Fine Light beer in the UK.

•

Third,
we need to strengthen our access to retail by building the capabilities that
are key to partnering and being successful with our wholesalers and retailers.
Our biggest investment to strengthen our access to retail in 2003 was the
initiative to improve our Americas supply-chain systems and processes.  Making these investments was a necessity for
the long-term success of our business. 
Our start-up problems were greater than expected, but in early 2004,
product supply has improved as wholesale and retail stock-outs are now a
fraction of what they were in our most difficult period early in the fourth
quarter of 2003.  When the capabilities
of our new supply-chain systems and processes are more fully optimized later
this year, our


distributors will have more
control over their orders, better visibility throughout the shipping process,
and better service, which we anticipate will result in efficiencies and cost
savings for us and for our distributors.

•

Fourth,
we need to lower our cost structure so that we can grow profits and afford the
investments needed to grow and succeed. 
In 2003 we made significant progress in both the Americas and Europe.  Productivity from operations in the US was
solid in 2003, despite soft volume.  In
the UK, we right-sized our production assets in 2003, and we expect to see the
benefits in 2004.

We believe these four
strategies represent the right business model for succeeding in our current
environment.  Despite our 2003 results
and the challenges ahead, we have made significant progress in key areas of our
business that make us optimistic about our future prospects.

Results of
Operations

Our consolidated results are driven by the results of our two operating
segments, Americas and Europe, and our unallocated corporate expenses. When
comparing 2003 to 2002, note that we only include CBL results since
February 2, 2002, the date of acquisition, thus excluding CBL’s January 2002
results.

Consolidated income before income taxes decreased 1.1% in 2003 compared
to 2002.  Our consolidated volume
increased 2.8% from 31.8 million barrels to 32.7 million barrels.  These results were driven by improved
performance in the second half of the year in our major businesses outside the
United States, including Europe, Canada, and the Caribbean.  Our business was also helped by favorable
foreign exchange rates, better margins, and improved UK operations
productivity.  However, offsetting these
positive factors,  our US business
suffered from soft industry demand throughout the year, increased popularity of
beers with low-carbohydrate positioning, and our product-supply disruptions
related to implementation of our new supply chain systems and processes late in
the year.

Our effective tax rate in 2003 at 31.2% was significantly lower than
our tax rate in 2002 at 37.0%.  The
lower rate was primarily the result of the favorable completion of tax audits
for the years 1996 through 2000 and benefits realized from the tax structure
related to the acquisition of our UK business. 
This lower tax rate is directly responsible for net income and earnings
per share increasing 8% in 2003 from the prior year.

From 2001 to 2002,
consolidated income before taxes increased significantly, primarily as a result
of our acquisition of CBL on February 2, 2002.  From 2001 to 2002, our net sales and income before income taxes
increased 55.4% and 29.6%, respectively, as a result of the additional
business.  We also experienced a
significant increase in interest expense, from $2.0 million to $70.9 million,
during 2002 as a result of debt incurred to acquire the CBL business.  We achieved an increase from 22.7 million
barrels to 31.8 million barrels of beverages, an increase of 40%. Our Americas
business reported a modest increase in income before income taxes and basically
flat volume from 2001 to 2002.  These
results are expanded upon in the Americas segment discussion that follows.

Our consolidated effective
tax rate was 37.0% in 2002, down from 37.9% for 2001.  The decrease was driven by the benefits realized from our UK
business.

Americas
Segment

The Americas segment is focused on the production, marketing and sales
of the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories. This
segment also includes the Coors Light business in Canada that is conducted
through a partnership investment with Molson, Coors Canada, and the sale of
Molson products in the United States that is conducted through a joint venture
investment, Molson USA. The Americas segment also includes the small amount of
volume that is sold outside of the United States and its territories and
Europe.

The 2002 net charge consists of
expenses related to restructuring and the dissolution of our former can and end
joint venture, offset by a cash payment on a debt from our former partner in a
brewing business in South Korea.  The
net 2001 charge consists of the restructuring of our purchasing and production
organizations, impairment charges on certain fixed assets, charges to dissolve
our former can and end joint venture and incremental consulting, legal and
other costs incurred in preparation to restructure and outsource our
information technology infrastructure.

Foreign Currency
impact on 2003 results

In 2003, our Americas segment benefited from a 10.8% year-over-year
increase in the value of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) against the US dollar.  As a result of this exchange rate
fluctuation, net sales, operating income, and income before taxes are higher
than in the prior year by approximately $5.5 million.

Net sales and volume

Net sales for the Americas segment increased slightly from 2002 to
2003.  On a per barrel basis, net sales
increased 1.8% while volume decreased 1.4% year-over-year.  Net sales were impacted positively by
continued favorable pricing in the United States, as well as significant growth
in our Canadian business.  Likewise, net
sales were impacted positively by a one-time $4.2 million increase in revenue
during the first quarter that resulted from the settlement of a contract
interpretation dispute between CBC and one of our wholesalers.  However, we experienced challenges in our
Americas segment as our volume was impacted negatively by a weak industry
demand throughout the year caused by a very wet summer in the Northeast and a
sluggish economy.  In addition, we were
negatively impacted by a mix shift toward lower revenue-per-barrel brands such
as Keystone Light, which experienced a volume growth of 10.9%.  Growing consumer interest in
low-carbohydrate food and beverage products hurt sales for Coors Light and
other premium light beers that did not have low-carbohydrate positioning.  As a result of this change in consumer
tastes and the mix shift away from premium products, Coors Light sales volume
declined in 2003.

We also experienced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of
2003 when we implemented new supply chain systems and processes.  Due to a difficult start-up early in the
fourth quarter, we were unable to ship sufficient quantities of beer in some
brand and package configurations.  While
our supply chain improved by the end of the year, the supply disruptions caused
by this implementation had a meaningful negative impact on 2003 volume and
earnings.

Our 2002 net sales decreased 0.9% from 2001, while volume for the
Americas segment remained relatively flat. 
Net revenue per barrel declined 1% from 2001.  The declines were mostly due to the sale of company-owned
distributorships in 2001 (whose volumes were included in 2001 results until the
date of sale), a decline in volume in Puerto Rico as a result of a 50% increase
in a beer excise tax that took effect during the summer of 2002, and a


negative sales mix in the United States where consumer preferences
moved toward our lower revenue-per-barrel brands, geographies, and
packages.  Partially offsetting these
declines in sales and volume was improved domestic pricing and reduced price
promotions.

From a brand perspective, growth in domestic Coors Light and Keystone
Light brands in 2002 versus 2001 were partially offset by declines in Zima,
Killian’s and exported Coors Light. 
Zima was impacted disproportionately by the influx of new flavored
alcohol beverages (FABs) in the United States during much of 2002.

Cost of goods sold
and gross profit

Americas cost of goods sold increased approximately 0.9% per barrel in
2003 versus 2002.  The overall increase
in cost of goods sold per barrel in 2003 was the result of higher depreciation
costs stemming from recent additions to fixed assets, higher pension and other
labor-related costs, increased fuel costs, and the de-leveraging of fixed costs
resulting from the decline in volume. Our higher pension costs were the result
of the unfavorable impacts of lower returns on pension assets in recent years
and lower discount rates. In addition to these more pervasive factors, we
incurred approximately $8 million of increased costs in the fourth quarter of
2003, primarily related to extra freight, direct labor and finished goods loss
associated with our new supply chain processes and systems implementation.
These costs were in addition to the impacts from decreased volume. However, our
controllable operations costs, which make up about 95% of our Americas cost of
goods sold, declined slightly per barrel during the year as a result of
operations efficiency initiatives and improved packaging costs.

Compared to 2002, our 2003 gross profit increased 1.8%, or 3.2% on a
per-barrel basis. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased by
nearly 1%. Increases were driven primarily by price increases and improved
operations efficiencies and lower packaging costs.

In 2002, we experienced a 3.3% decrease in cost of goods sold.  On a per-barrel basis, the decline was
3.4%.  As a percentage of net sales,
cost of goods sold was approximately 61.7% in 2002 compared to 63.3% in 2001.
These decreases are attributable primarily to the sale of company-owned
distributorships in 2001, lower transportation and packaging costs and
continued operations efficiency initiatives in our breweries.  Offsetting these decreases were higher costs
associated with adding capacity to our Golden and Memphis manufacturing
facilities and bottle packaging capacity in Shenandoah, Virginia.  We also incurred higher pension and other
labor-related costs.

Our gross profit increased 3.3% in 2002 over 2001. As a percentage of
net sales, gross profit increased nearly 2%. Increases were driven by the
decline in cost of goods sold.

Marketing, General
and Administrative expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3%, or 3.8%
on a per barrel basis, in 2003 compared to 2002.  This increase was driven by higher costs for employee benefits,
primarily pension costs, and higher spending levels related to information
technology.  Selling and marketing
expense was also slightly higher year-over-year.

In 2002, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3%
over the previous year, driven by higher marketing expense as we invested more
behind our brands in advertising and sales promotion, higher systems
investments and labor-related costs. Partially offset by this increase in
selling and marketing expense was a decline in general and administrative
expense due to the sale of company-owned distributorships in 2001.

Europe
Segment

The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL
brands, principally in the United Kingdom but also in other parts of the world,
our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of
Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and our joint venture
arrangement for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain
(Tradeteam).  It also includes the sale
of Coors Fine Light in the United Kingdom and Coors Light in the Republic of
Ireland. Note that the CBL results for January 2002, typically a loss
month, are excluded from the 2002 results discussed below.


(1)

Since we did not own CBL prior to
February 2002, we do not report historical financial results for this
business.  Accordingly, the historical
Europe segment results include only our pre-acquisition Europe operation, which
generated very small volume and revenue. 
Our discussion on the comparative results of the Europe segment from
2001 to 2002 has been excluded, as comparative results are not meaningful.

(2)

2003 other income, net was composed
primarily of Tradeteam income (included in cost of goods sold in 2002), offset
by leasehold expenses and losses on asset sales (See Item 8, Note 2).  In 2002, other income, net primarily related
to income from a small investment in an internet marketing venture in the UK.

Foreign currency
impact on 2003 results

In 2003, our Europe segment benefited from an 8.4% year-over-year
increase in the value of the British pound sterling (GBP) against the US
dollar, partially as a result of this exchange rate fluctuation, all results
from our Europe segment in 2003 are significantly higher than in the prior
year.  The following table summarizes
the approximate effect this change in exchange rate had on the Europe results
in 2003:

Net sales and volume

Net sales for the Europe segment increased 15.6% in 2003, while volume
increased 13.2% from the previous year. 
The significant increase in net sales and volume was partly due to our
owning the CBL business for the full year in 2003 versus forty-seven weeks in
2002. 9% of the sales increase represents the effect of currency exchange
rates. On a full year comparative basis, our sales volumes increased 6.7%. This
growth was driven by the Carling and Grolsch brands, both of which grew volume
by more than 10% during the year.

Our on-trade business, which represents approximately two-thirds of our
Europe volume and an even greater portion of margin, grew volume by
approximately 5% compared to the full year 2002 as a result of strong sales
execution, particularly with Carling and Carling Extra Cold, and unusually hot
weather in the United Kingdom this summer. 
In a declining on-trade market, this yielded a market share gain of
approximately 1.5 percentage points. Our off-trade volume for 2003 increased
approximately 13% over the comparable period in 2002, led by Carling and
Grolsch.


Contributing factors to this volume growth were the favorable summer
weather and aggressive discounting, primarily in the first half of the year.
Our off-trade market share growth for the year was approximately 1%.

Our positive volume in both the on- and off-trade and positive pricing
in the on-trade were partially offset by a decline in our on-trade factored
brand sales and, in the off-trade, heavy price discounting and mix shift toward
lower revenue-per-barrel sales. The decline in sales of factored brands in the
on-trade was driven by some of our large on-trade chain customers changing to
purchase non-Coors products directly from the brand owners.

Cost of goods sold
and gross profit

Cost of goods sold increased 19.3% in 2003 versus 2002.  On a per-barrel basis, cost of goods sold
increased 5.4%.  The aggregate increase
in cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher foreign
exchange rates, coupled with our owning the business for the full year versus
only a partial period in 2002.  Also
driving this increase, and the increase in the per barrel cost, was the
reclassification of Tradeteam earnings from cost of goods sold to other income
beginning in 2003 and the loss of income from contract brewing arrangements
that substantially ceased near the end of 2002. Additionally, during the first
three quarters of 2003, we incurred higher production costs as we contracted with
regional brewers to package some of our off-trade volume while we were
commissioning the new and upgraded packing lines in our Burton brewery.

We were able to realize some benefit from right-sizing and improving
our UK production infrastructure towards the latter half of the year, which
partially offset the increases noted above. 
The increases in cost of goods sold were also reduced by the decrease in
factored brand volume where the purchase cost is included in our cost of goods
sold, but the related volume is not included in reported volumes.

Gross profit in the Europe segment increased 8.0%; however, excluding
the impact of foreign exchange, gross profit was essentially flat despite the
inclusion of a full year of sales in 2003. Gross profit per barrel decreased
4.6% and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2% during 2003 as
a result of the reclassification of Tradeteam earnings and our contract
packaging costs incurred as we commissioned the packaging lines in Burton.

Marketing, general
and administrative expenses

Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0%
during 2003 almost entirely due to exchange rates and the impact of the full
year of ownership. On a per-barrel basis, marketing, general and administrative
expenses decreased 3.7% year-over-year. Various factors impacted marketing,
general and administrative expense during 2003, which effectively off-set each
other: (a) we had higher investments in sales staff and increased depreciation
charges from investments in information systems and dispense equipment, the
latter supporting the sales growth in the on-trade; (b) we were impacted by the
loss of reimbursements from the transitional services arrangements with
Interbrew S.A. that were set up following the CBL acquisition in
February 2002 and largely concluded by the end of that year. These
reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to marketing, general and
administrative expenses in 2002; (c) we realized savings in employee bonus
costs and directors’ costs; and (d) the one-time gain of $3.5 million before
tax on the sale of the rights to our Hooper’s Hooch FAB brand in Russia during
the third quarter.

Interest income

Interest income is earned on
trade loans to UK on-trade customers. Interest income increased 4.7% in 2003 as
a result of favorable foreign exchange rates, the inclusion of an additional
five weeks of results in 2003 and a lower debt balance in 2003.

Corporate

Corporate currently includes
interest expense and certain other general and administrative costs that are
not allocable to either the Americas or Europe operating segments. Corporate
contains no sales or cost of goods sold. In 2003, we changed our allocation
methodology between the Americas and Europe segments for general and
administrative expenses, leaving certain of these costs in Corporate. The 2002
and 2001 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new
presentation.  The majority of these
corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such
as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.

primarily to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and

N/M = Not Meaningful

Marketing, general
and administrative expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expenses for Corporate increased
11.0% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to increased pension and benefit costs and
management of a larger global business. 
2002 marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
significantly from 2001 for the same reasons.

Interest income

Interest income for 2003 decreased $2.7 million because of lower
interest rates and lower cash balances in 2003 over 2002. Interest income
decreased $11.6 million from 2001 to 2002 due to higher cash and
interest-bearing securities balances in 2001. We sold all of our
interest-bearing securities in January 2002 to help fund the acquisition
of CBL.

Interest expense

Interest expense increased
$10.3 million in 2003. This increase was driven by having our fixed-rate debt
structure in place for the full year in 2003 versus only eight months in 2002
and the currency appreciation on our GBP-denominated term debt prior to its
payoff in August 2003.  Prior to
finalizing the long-term structure in second quarter of 2002, we had
exclusively short-term borrowings at lower interest rates that supported our
acquisition of CBL in February 2002. The increase is also due to our
cross-currency swap structure and our GBP-denominated interest expense.
Partially offsetting these factors was the implementation of our lower interest
rate commercial paper program in June 2003, the initial proceeds of which
we used to pay down approximately $300 million of higher-rate GBP-denominated
term debt. Our new debt structure has lower interest costs on outstanding
balances.

2002 interest expense
increased $68.9 million versus 2001 due to the significant increase in debt
incurred to purchase CBL early that year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating
activities and external borrowings. As of December 28, 2003, including
cash and short-term borrowings, we had negative working capital of $54.9
million compared to negative working capital of $94.0 million at
December 29, 2002. We are able to operate with a negative working capital
investment because of relatively short terms on receivables in our Americas
segment and our ability to carry low levels of finished goods inventories as a
result of the structure of our distribution system. These factors are offset by
higher investments in working capital in Europe, primarily with regard to
accounts receivable. The increase in our working capital is the net result of
changes in our short-term borrowings, accrued expenses and other liabilities,
accounts and notes receivable and raw materials. At December 28, 2003,
cash and short-term marketable securities totaled


$19.4 million, compared to $59.2 million at December 29,
2002. Our cash and short-term marketable securities balances decreased
primarily due to early payments of principal and interest on our long-term debt
made late in our fiscal year 2003.

We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by
short-term borrowings, when necessary, will be quite sufficient to meet our
ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on
debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our
liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our
products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the
acceptability of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the
other factors we describe in the section titled “Risk Factors.” We
continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our operating cash flow
through potential monetizations of assets. Success in accomplishing these
efforts will result in faster reduction of outstanding debt. We also have
credit facilities that contain financial and operating covenants, and provide
for scheduled repayments, that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis.
During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, we made debt repayments of
approximately $272.0 million.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $285.6 million
in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was attributable primarily to cash
provided by trade receivables and payables in 2003 - the result of continued
emphasis on working capital management by improving receivable collection in
the UK and managing the purchasing cycle throughout the Company.

Net cash provided by
operating activities increased $65.1 million in 2002, compared to 2001.  The change was attributable primarily to the
acquisition of CBL, which added to our depreciation and amortization and
modified the composition of our working capital in 2002.

Investing Activities

During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, we used net cash
of $229.9 million in investing activities, compared to $1.6 billion used
in 2002. The decrease in net cash used is due to the $1.6 billion payment,
net of cash acquired, made to purchase CBL in 2002. However, excluding our 2002
$1.6 billion payment to acquire CBL, total cash used in investing
activities increased approximately $232.9 million compared to the same
period last year, mainly due to the absence of sales and maturities of
investments in 2003 versus 2002. A significant amount of investments was sold
in 2002 to help fund the acquisition of CBL.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.4 billion from 2001
to 2002.  The increase was due to the
cash used in the acquisition of CBL. Also, in 2001, we made a payment of $65.0
million for our 49.9% interest in Molson USA. 
However, excluding these payments, total cash provided by investing
activities increased approximately $134.7 million year-over-year mostly due to
a substantial decrease in purchases of securities.  As a result of our debt burden associated with the CBL
acquisition, we did not purchase any marketable securities in 2002 compared to
purchases of $228.2 million during 2001.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $357.4 million in 2003,
representing a $1.6 billion decrease from cash provided by financing activities
in 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to the $2.4 billion proceeds
from issuance of debt in 2002, partially offset by larger payments on debt and
capital lease obligations in 2002. 
Debt-related activity in 2003 reflected net payments of long- and
short-term debt totaling  $297.1 million
whereas in 2002, debt-related activity reflected a net increase in long- and
short-term debt of $1.3 billion, due primarily to borrowings related to our
acquisition of CBL.  Repayments of
long-term debt during 2003 totaled $272.0 million; the remaining change in
financing activities relates to temporary changes in short-term borrowings.

In 2002, net cash provided by financing activities increased $1.3
billion from the previous year as a result of debt proceeds and payments
associated with our acquisition of CBL. 
Excluding these items, change in financing activities was driven by
changes in overdraft balances and the absence of treasury stock purchases in
2002 versus purchases of $72.3 million in 2001.


Debt Structure

Our total borrowings as of December 28, 2003, were composed of the
following:

The aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt for the next
five fiscal years are as follows:

We incurred significant debt in 2002 to finance the purchase of CBL.
Since the acquisition, we have used cash from operating activities and from
asset monetizations, net of capital expenditures and other cash used in
investing activities, to make payments on our debt obligations.

In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million of commercial
paper, approximately $250 million of which was outstanding at December 28,
2003.  $200 million of our commercial
paper balance is classified as long-term, reflecting our intent to keep this
amount outstanding for longer than 360 days and our ability to refinance these
borrowings on a long-term basis through our revolving line of credit. The
remaining $50 million is classified as short term, as our intent is to repay
that portion in the next twelve months.

Concurrent with our issuance of commercial paper, we made a payment
against the then-outstanding principal and interest on our GBP-denominated
amortizing term loan of approximately 181.1 million GBP ($300.3 million at
then-prevailing foreign currency exchange rates) using proceeds from our
issuance of commercial paper. We repaid the balance of our GBP term loan in the
third quarter of 2003 using cash generated from operations. We also repaid $55
million of our US dollar (USD)-denominated term loan in the fourth quarter. In
conjunction with these payments, we accelerated our amortization of loan fees,
resulting in a charge of $3.7 million to interest expense during the year. See
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further information.

In May 2003, we increased our unsecured committed credit arrangement
from $300 million to $500 million in order to support our commercial paper
program. As of December 28, 2003, $250 million of the total $500 million
line of credit was being used as a backstop for our commercial paper program
while the remainder was available for general corporate purposes.

At December 28, 2003,
CBC had two USD-denominated uncommitted lines of credit totaling $50.0 million
in aggregate. The lines of credit are with two different lenders. We had $7.0
million outstanding under these lines of credit as of December 28,
2003.  CBL had two 10 million GBP
uncommitted lines of credit and a 10


million GBP overdraft
facility. No amount had been drawn on the overdraft facility as of
December 28, 2003. The lines of credit had balances outstanding of $11.9
million at December 28, 2003.

In addition, we have two
uncommitted lines of credit totaling 900 million Japanese yen or approximately
$8.4 million at December 28, 2003.  At
December 28, 2003, interest rates were below 1% and balances outstanding
totaled $2.4 million.

Some of our debt instruments require us to meet certain covenant
restrictions, including financial tests and other limitations.  As of December 28, 2003, we were in
compliance with all of these covenants.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

Contractual Cash
Obligations as of December 28, 2003

Other Commercial
Commitments

(1)

Approximately $4.3 billion of the
total other long-term obligations relate to long-term supply contracts with our
joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties to purchase material used in
packaging, such as cans and bottles. 
Approximately $1.2 billion relates to commitments associated with our
logistics provider in the UK.  The
remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology
services, open purchase orders and other commitments. On July 29, 2003, we
signed a new agreement, effective August 1, 2003, with Owens relating to
the operation of our joint venture and the production of glass bottles, as well
as the supply of glass bottles for our non-Golden commercial business. The new
agreement has a term of 12 years, and is reflected in the table above, whereas
the previous agreement extended to 2005. In December 2003, we signed a new
agreement with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), an information services provider,
effective January 1, 2004. The new EDS contract includes services to our
Americas and Europe operations and our corporate offices and will expire in
2010. Included in Other long-term obligations is the effect of our most recent
completed contract with GPC, dated March 25, 2003.

(2)

Guarantees consist of guaranteed
portions of short-term debt also included in “Long-term debt” above.

(3)

Represents expected
contributions under our defined benefit pension plans and our benefits payments
under retiree medical plans.

Advertising and
Promotions

As of December 28, 2003, our aggregate
commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports
arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $250 million
over the next five years.

Capital Expenditures

In 2003, we spent approximately $240 million on capital improvement
projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 62% was in support of the Europe
business and the remainder was for the Americas. We currently plan capital
expenditures in the same range, or slightly lower, for 2004.

Pension Plans

Although pension investment returns were strong in 2003, the impact of
the three previous years’ returns and a continued decline in interest rates
resulted in a slightly lower consolidated funded position at year-end 2003


compared to year-end 2002.  At
year-end 2003, the accumulated pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair
value of the plan assets on a consolidated US dollar basis by approximately
$411 million, compared to $394 million at the end of 2002.  Accordingly, we have taken a charge to
equity of $15.0 million, net of tax (Refer to Item 8. Note 12). At year-end
2003, the projected benefit obligations were $2,624.9 million and the
accumulated benefit obligations were $2,412.5 million.

The amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for accrued
pension liability, accumulated other comprehensive loss, prepaid benefit cost
and intangible asset in 2003 are $452.3 million, $385.6 million ($236.0
million, net of tax), $41.5 million and $40.8 million, respectively.  In 2003, an additional minimum pension
liability of $9.7 million was recorded and is included in the accrued pension
liability amount. It is our practice to fund amounts for pensions at least
sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee
benefits laws and local tax laws.  For
further information regarding pension plan assets, refer to Note 7, “Employee
Retirement Plans,” and Note 13, “Other Comprehensive Income,” in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In 2003, our actuarially assumed long-term rates of return on plan
asset investments were 9% for the US Retirement Plan and 7.5% for the UK Plan.
In selecting those assumptions, we considered investment returns by asset class
as represented by our independent pension investment consultants, and applied
the relevant asset allocation percentages. The discount rates of 6.25% and
5.63% were based on prevailing yields of high-quality corporate fixed income
investments in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.

In 2003, consolidated pension expense was $38.7 million, which
represented approximately 1% of consolidated cost of goods sold and other
operating expenses.  Pension
contributions on a consolidated basis were $51.0 million during 2003. On a
consolidated basis we anticipate making voluntary pension contributions of
approximately $69 million in 2004.

On a consolidated basis, we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of
$598.0 million and $547.0 million at December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively. Actuarial losses are primarily comprised
of cumulative investment returns that are lower than actuarially assumed investment
returns and liability losses due to increased pension liabilities and falling
interest rates. Pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial losses
after they exceed certain thresholds. As a result of losses in excess of the
thresholds, we recorded actuarial loss amortization of $9.1 million in 2003 and
$1.0 million in 2002. It is expected that actuarial loss amortization in 2004
will increase to approximately $14 million. We anticipate consolidated pension
expense will increase from the $38.7 million in 2003 to approximately $49
million in 2004.  The expected increase
in consolidated pension cost is primarily due to the combined impacts of higher
actuarial loss amortization and foreign exchange.

Outlook
for 2004

Americas Segment

Net Sales and Volume

Going into 2004, we expect the US pricing environment to remain
positive and anticipate continued good performance in Canada. Nonetheless, an
increase in price discounting or a decline in volume could have an unfavorable
impact on sales and margins. Further, sales and margins could be impacted
adversely if the negative mix shift that we experienced in 2003 continues into
2004.

We believe that the March launch of our own low-carbohydrate beer,
Aspen Edge, will make us more competitive and contribute to improved volume
treads in 2004. Also in response to the low-carbohydrate interest, we began
running new consumer education advertising for our Coors Light brand,
indicating that Coors Light is nearly as low in carbohydrates as our
competitions’ brands with low-carbohydrate positioning.  While the disruptions caused by the
implementation of our new supply chain systems during the fourth quarter were
frustrating both to us and to our distributors and caused us to lose volume, we
were able to work through most of our product supply issues and rebuild overall
distributor inventories by the middle of the first quarter of 2004.  During December, sales-to-retail trends were
soft and resulted in distributor inventories ending 2003 approximately 100,000
barrels higher than normal seasonal levels. 
This will impact 2004 volume trends, as distributors work down their
inventories to normal seasonal levels during peak season. Finally, going into
2004, we continue to focus on regaining volume momentum, improving shipment
performance, rebuilding the reliability and efficiency of our supply chain and gearing
up for the peak summer selling season.

Cost of Goods Sold

In 2004, we believe the following factors are most important to our
cost of goods sold per barrel expectations:

•

First, input costs will increase in 2004, as
we expect modestly higher packaging material expenses due to higher aluminum
prices and energy-related costs. Fuel costs and new transportation carrier
regulations are likely to have an unfavorable impact on logistics costs.

•

Second,
labor-related costs are expected to increase in 2004, primarily due to higher
pension and healthcare costs.

•

Third, we remain
confident that our continued focus on operating efficiency within our entire
supply chain will help us achieve our long-term goal of reducing controllable
production costs by $4-5 per barrel over the next 4-5 years.  However, our ability to realize these
savings is partially dependant on our ability to leverage fixed costs, and a
significant change in our volume assumptions could impact our ability to reach
this goal. While supply chain performance is better than it was in the fourth
quarter of 2003, and while we have numerous initiatives underway to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of our supply chain, we still need more progress
to have success in the coming peak season.

•

Finally, our
2003 cost per barrel results were adversely impacted by additional costs
related to the implementation of our new supply chain systems.

Marketing, General
and Administrative Expenses

Marketing and sales spending in the Americas in 2004
is expected to increase at a proportionately higher rate than the past few
years as we plan to invest behind our Aspen Edge launch and incrementally
behind our Coors Light marketing and sales efforts. Consistent with our
philosophy and past practice, we will evaluate our brand and sales investment
levels during the year and adjust as needed.

General and administrative expense will be
higher in 2004 primarily due to higher labor costs, including higher pension
and healthcare expense, and increased spending on information systems.

Europe
Segment

Net Sales and Volume

In Europe, we anticipate
that our on-trade channel business will continue to grow both volume and
share  in 2004, but at a slower pace
than in 2003, when volume trends benefited from the rollout of Carling Extra
Cold and hot summer weather. In the off-trade channel, volume and market-share
trends are likely to slow substantially in the first three quarters of 2004 as
we lap aggressive off-trade discounting activity and the unusually warm summer
of 2003.


Nonetheless, we are
optimistic that the impact of lower volume will be more than offset by the
related improvement in margins, as it was in the fourth quarter of 2003, when
we achieved better balance between growth and margins.

We anticipate that volumes in the second quarter will benefit from the
Euro 2004 football (soccer) tournament. In contrast, the third quarter could
face particularly challenging volume comparisons due to the beneficial impact
of the hot weather in 2003.

We also
anticipate that shifts in our factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by
other companies but delivered to retail by us) will continue to have an adverse
financial impact, however this will be at a lower rate than in 2003.

Cost of Goods Sold

Regarding costs, apart from a minor impact in the first quarter of
2004, we will no longer be lapping the income from contract brewing and
transitional service arrangements, which ended early in 2003. As a result, the
benefit of right-sizing and improving our UK infrastructure and supply chain
will flow into our cost structure, but we anticipate that there will be
significant offsets from inflation and negative channel and package mix.  With slower off-trade volume growth and our
new Burton packaging lines operating better, we anticipate a much lower need
for high-priced contract packaging services from other brewers in 2004 than in
2003.

Marketing, General
and Administrative

Marketing, general & administrative spending is likely to increase
in local currency in 2004 as we roll out the Coors Fine Light brand in the
United Kingdom and incur increased labor costs and depreciation on dispense
equipment, which stems from the strong on-trade growth we achieved in 2003.
Increases are also expected from the recently signed contract with EDS, which
is extended to CBL for the first time in 2004.

Other Income

Comparisons of other income between the third quarter of 2004 with the
third quarter of 2003 may be difficult due to the $3.5 million gain on the sale
of the rights to our Hooper’s Hooch brand in Russia during 2003.

Interest

Consolidated 2004 interest income is expected to be fairly consistent
with 2003, and will consist primarily of UK trade-loan interest income.

We expect interest expense
to be approximately $8-10 million lower than 2003 due partially to debt
repayments we made during 2003 on our higher interest rate debt.  Additionally, we expect to benefit from our
lower-interest rate commercial paper program that we implemented in 2003, the
proceeds of which were used to pay down higher interest rate debt.

Taxes

We expect that our 2004
effective tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 35% absent any unusual items,
up from 31.2% in 2003.  The comparison
will be particularly challenging against the second quarter of 2003, when our
effective tax rate was 25.8% because of the completion of five years of tax
audits.  Our acquisition structure for
the UK business is generally beneficial from a tax perspective but adds
considerable volatility to our tax rate.


Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures
(excluding capital improvements for our container joint ventures which we
tentatively plan to consolidate in 2004) are planned to be in the range of $225
million and $235 million in 2004, down from $240 million in 2003.  The actual amount will depend on foreign
exchange rates and our evaluation of a few potential projects now under review.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. We review our accounting
policies on an on-going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting
estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of
operations:

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the Americas segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit
risk is insignificant as the majority of the Americas accounts receivable
balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a
predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. Also,
in the Americas, we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase
money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and
other letters of credit.

Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and,
because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our
ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide
allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to
collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are
recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer (total amount of all
trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security
and insurance coverage) at the point the account is considered uncollectible.
We record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses.
Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the
point an account is written off.

We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our
customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our
estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially
affected, and we may be required to record additional allowances.

Pension and
Postretirement Benefits

We have defined benefit
plans that cover the majority of our employees. As a result of the acquisition
of CBL, we have assumed responsibility for a portion of the assets and
liabilities of what was the Bass Brewers Pension Plan, renamed the Coors
Brewers Pension Plan. CBC also has postretirement welfare plans that provide
medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for
certain retirees.  The accounting for
these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87, “

Employers
Accounting for Pensions

” (SFAS No. 87) and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, “

Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

” (SFAS
No. 106).  Both of these statements
require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate
of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and
expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other
assumptions.  We believe that the
accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans is a
critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from
period to period based on market conditions.

We performed an analysis of
high yield bonds at the end of 2003 to support the discount rates used in
determining our pension liabilities in the United States and in the United
Kingdom for the year ended December 28, 2003. Discount rates and expected
rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year
and impact actual expense in the subsequent year. A fifty basis point change in
certain assumptions would have the following effects:



Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have
the following effects:

flip

Both US and UK plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with
smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. 
Equity assets are well diversified between US and other international
investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through
allocations to large-cap, small-cap, and growth and value investments. Relative
allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. For
example, our UK participants are more heavily weighted toward pensioners than
our US participants. Therefore, we have elected a smaller equity percentage in
our UK plan. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of
February 27, 2004 with actual asset allocations at December 28, 2003:

Contingencies,
Environmental and Litigation Reserves

We estimate the range of
liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the
amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a
loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes
available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matter and
revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or
improve the safety or efficiency of company-owned assets or are incurred to
mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized.
Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred.  We also expense legal costs as incurred.  The most significant estimates that could impact
our financial statements relate to the Lowry Superfund site (See Item 8, Note
14).

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Asset Valuation

We adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial Standards No. 141,
“

Business Combinations

” (SFAS No.
141) on July 1, 2001, and No. 142, “

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

” (SFAS No. 142) on December 31,
2001. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets when
there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant
judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets
for impairment, most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be
generated by these assets and the rate used to discount those cash flows.  For brewing business goodwill and
intangibles, we used a rate of 7.6% to discount our cash flows during our
annual impairment testing in 2003, which is a rate we believe to be representative
of the weighted cost of capital for similar assets.  We used a rate of 11% for our distribution rights associated with
our distribution subsidiary. Changes in these estimates could have a material
adverse effect on the assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets,
thereby requiring us to write down the assets. As an example, our valuation
model for the goodwill associated with our Molson USA joint venture assumes
certain volume growth and pricing assumptions that only small changes in which
could result in significant impairment charges.

Derivatives

We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our
exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such
contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. All
derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they
will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures. We account for our
derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair
value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

” (SFAS No. 133), which we early adopted on
December 28, 1998. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant
interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve,
as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation
of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based
upon valuation methodologies


deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different
assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Judgment is
required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the
ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which
the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision
is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by
many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the
period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax
law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in
which such changes are enacted.

We record a net deferred tax asset or tax liability based on the
un-remitted earnings of our UK subsidiary that are not permanently reinvested
in accordance with APB 23.  In
conjunction with this calculation, we estimate associated earnings and profit
adjustments, potential foreign tax credits and cumulative translation
adjustments relating to the foreign exchange rates.

We do not provide deferred taxes on certain outside basis difference in
our acquired foreign subsidiary’s stock, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL). This
outside basis difference is permanent in duration under SFAS 109 because we do
not intend to take any action that would result in recognizing the gain
inherent in certain book-over-tax basis differences. As a result, differences
between book and tax treatment of income statement items in our UK business are
treated as permanent. This treatment increases the volatility in our effective
tax rate.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to
the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to
determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the
future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise,
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would
be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to
the valuation allowance related to the acquisition of CBL that relate to
deferred taxes arising from that acquisition would reduce goodwill, unless the
reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would
impact earnings.

Equity Method
Accounting

We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20% -50% owned
investments where we exercise significant influence. As described below, we
have an equity ownership in, and conduct business with various joint ventures,
which directly relate to our core activities. There are no related parties that
own interests in our equity method investments (see further discussion in Item
8, Note 2).

Coors Canada is a general partnership that was formed to market CBC
products in Canada. We own a 50.1% interest in this non-consolidated joint
venture that we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the
effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under
the operating agreement.  All
manufacture, distribution and sale of CBC branded beers are contracted to
Molson by the partnership. The partnership never takes title to the beer. It is
paid an amount equal to the sales proceeds Molson receives from third-party
customers, less the costs incurred by Molson for its manufacture, distribution
and sale of the CBC branded products. We reflect this amount in net sales in
our Consolidated Statements of Income.

RMMC and RMBC, are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and
distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core
competencies sought by us to reduce costs. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch
was formed to provide a long-term relationship with that brand’s owner in a key
segment of the U.K. beer market. In 2003 and 2002, our share of the pre-tax
joint venture profits for each of these investments was offset against cost of
goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In 2003, we included our entire share of CBL’s Tradeteam joint venture
results in the other income, net line of our Consolidated Statements of Income,
given the immateriality of its results. 
In 2002, we included our share of Tradeteam results in cost of goods sold.  This change in presentation was attributable
to Tradeteam no longer being a captive provider of distribution and logistics
services to CBL. In November 2002, Tradeteam entered into an agreement to
provide distribution services to Interbrew U.K. Limited, another large brewer
in the United Kingdom.


Other income, net line includes the equity method income for the Molson
USA joint venture. This joint venture was formed to import, market, sell and
distribute Molson products in the United States. We have recorded our share of
the venture’s results in the other income, net line in our Consolidated
Statements of Income given the immateriality of its results.

A qualitative analysis of our results would be impacted if the results
of these joint ventures were included in different lines of our Consolidated
Statements of Income.

FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB51

The FASB finalized FIN 46R in
December 2003. FIN 46R expands the scope of ARB51 and various EITFs and
can require consolidation of legal structures, called

“variable interest entities (VIEs).”

We do have VIEs that we have tentatively
determined will qualify for consolidation. These include RMMC and RMBC. We plan
to consolidate these VIEs in the first quarter of 2004.  Although we believe our Grolsch and Coors
Canada investments are VIEs, we are still evaluating whether we are the primary
beneficiaries for these investments with respect to consolidation under FIN 46.
The most significant impacts to our financial statements will be to add the
fixed assets of RMMC and RMBC totaling approximately $75 million, and RMMC debt
of approximately $45 million to our balance sheet.  The impact to our gross profit margin in the income statement is
not expected to be significant.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB
104), Revenue Recognition

SAB 104 was released in
December 2003.  SAB 104 updates
interpretative guidance in the codification of staff accounting bulletins to
provide consistent accounting guidance on revenue recognition.  We adopted SAB 104 in December 2003 with no
impact to our financial statements or our financial reporting.

Related Party Transactions

Transactions
with Management and Others

From time-to-time, we employ members of the Coors family, which
collectively owns 100% of the voting common stock of the company. Hiring and
placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages
offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the
company.

Certain
Business Relationships

We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements
from Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. Various Coors family
trusts collectively own all of our Class A voting common stock, approximately
30% of our Class B common stock, and approximately 30% of GPC’s common stock.

Our purchases under the GPC packaging agreement in 2003 totaled $106.4
million. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts
Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $5.0 million and $0.8 million
at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.

We are also a limited partner in a real estate development partnership
in which a subsidiary of GPC is the general partner. The partnership owns,
develops, operates and sells certain real estate previously owned directly by
us. We received no distributions from this partnership in 2003.


Risk Factors

The reader should carefully consider the following factors and the
other information contained within this document. The most important factors
that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements,
include, but are not limited to, the following:

Government
regulatory authorities specific to the alcohol beverage industry in the markets
in which we operate may adopt regulations that could increase our costs or our
liabilities or could limit our business activities.

Our business is highly regulated by
national and local government entities. These regulations govern many parts of
our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation,
distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. We do not know that
we have been or will at all times be in compliance with all past, present or
future regulatory requirements or that we will not incur material costs or
liabilities in complying with regulatory requirements.

We have indebtedness
that is substantial in relation to our stockholders’ equity.

As of December 28, 2003, we held
approximately $1.2 billion in debt primarily related to our acquisition of CBL.
As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be
dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt. If our financial
and operating performance is insufficient to generate sufficient cash flow for
all of our activities, we may be required to use a disproportionate amount of
cash to satisfy our obligations.

We are subject to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound
and the Canadian dollar.

With the acquisition of CBL in 2002, we
significantly altered the impact of currency fluctuations on our results of
operations and cash flows. 2003 results have benefited significantly from a
strengthening of the British pound versus the US dollar, offset to a certain
extent by cash flow hedges on a portion of our debt. We cannot predict future
fluctuations in exchange rates. A future devaluation of the British pound
versus the US dollar could negatively impact results.

Our primary
production facilities in the Americas and in Europe are each located at a
single site, so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors to
transportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural disasters.

Our
primary Americas production facilities are located in Golden, Colorado, where
we brew more than 90%, and package approximately 63%, of our products sold in
the Americas business. Our primary production facility in Europe is located in
Burton-on-Trent, England, where we brew and package approximately 70% of our
products sold in the Europe business. While our business operations remain
centralized, our competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries
and packaging facilities. As a result, we must ship our products greater
distances than some of our competitors, making us more vulnerable to
fluctuations in costs such as fuel or packaging costs.

We rely on a small
number of suppliers to obtain the packaging and raw materials we need to
operate our business.

We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging for our US
products from GPC. This packaging is unique to us and is not produced by any
other supplier. Additionally, we are contractually obligated to purchase
substantially all of our can and bottle needs in the United States from our
container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball
Corporation (RMMC) and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). CBL has
only a single source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any of these
suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to
develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our
business. In regard to agricultural products, the supply and price of raw
materials, including water, used to produce our products can be affected by a
number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts and other
weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, various plant
diseases and pests. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects the
ingredients used to produce our products, our results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

Any significant
shift in consumer packaging preferences in the beer industry could
disproportionately increase our costs and could limit our ability to meet
consumer demand.

Reconfiguring our packaging
facilities to produce different types or amounts of packaging than we currently
produce would likely increase our costs. In addition, we may not be able to
complete any necessary changes quickly enough to keep pace with shifting
consumer preferences. Our primary competitors are larger and may be better able
to accommodate a packaging preference shift. If we are not able to respond
quickly to a packaging preference shift, our sales and market share could
decline.

Our success depends
largely on the success of two primary products, one in the United States and
one in the United Kingdom; the failure or weakening of either could materially
adversely affect our financial results.


Although we currently have 14 products in our US portfolio, Coors Light
represented more than 70% of our Americas sales volume for 2003. In the United
Kingdom, Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the United Kingdom and
represented approximately 69% of CBL sales volume in 2003. Consequently, any
material shift in consumer preferences away from Coors Light or Carling would
have a disproportionately negative impact on our business.

If the contract we
have with our current information technology service provider fails, we could
experience significant disruption in our business.

We rely exclusively on one information technology services provider for our
network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration, both at CBC and CBL.
If the service provider fails and we are unable to find a suitable replacement
in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our information
technology systems.

We are

significantly smaller than our two
primary competitors in the Americas segment, and may consequently be more
vulnerable to cost and price fluctuations.

At retail, our brands
compete on the basis of quality, taste, advertising, price, packaging
innovation and retail execution by our distributors. Competition in our various
markets could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital and other
expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial results. We compete primarily with AB and
Miller, the top two brewers in the United States. Both of these competitors
have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution
resources than CBC has. Furthermore, these competitors are not as concentrated
geographically in their product sales as CBC is. Consequently, we are somewhat
disadvantaged versus their greater economies of scale.

If the social
acceptability of our products declines, or if litigation is directed at the
alcohol beverage industry, our sales volumes could decrease and our business
could be materially adversely affected.

Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits
manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices
and  alleged underage consumption. Each
suit seeks an injunction and unspecified money damages. (See Item 3, Legal
Proceedings, for further information about the cases.) These cases are evidence
of increased social and political attention directed to the alcohol beverage
industry in recent years. If the social acceptability of beer were to decline
significantly, or if our industry were to become involved in litigation similar
to that of the tobacco industry, our business could be materially adversely
affected.

We are highly
dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our
products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our
products.

We sell all of our products in the
United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our
distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are significantly
smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also
sell products that compete with our products. We cannot control or provide any
assurance that these distributors will not give our competitors’ products
higher priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the
regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change
distributors. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace
unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and
results of operation may be adversely affected.

Benefits related to
our redesigned supply chain processes and systems in the United may not be
realized.

During 2003, we implemented our
redesigned supply chain processes and systems in the United States. We use this
system to schedule production, track inventories and bill our customers.
We may not achieve the benefits we expect from these re-engineered processes.
We experienced difficulties with the implementation of the systems in the fall
of 2003 and, as a result, we incurred about $8 million of increased costs,
primarily related to extra freight, labor and finished goods loss. The supply
disruptions also had a meaningful impact on our volume. We are still facing
challenges, including stock-outs and low inventory levels of some of our
products throughout our US business. We are working to improve our shipping
performance, to rebuild the reliability and efficiency of our supply chain and
to reduce stock-outs. If we are unable to correct the remaining issues in time
for our peak selling season, it may materially adversely impact our business.

We cannot predict
with certainty our eventual aggregate cost for our environmental and related
matters in which we are currently involved.

We are
one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
as a potentially liable party (PRP) at the Lowry Superfund Site. As a PRP, we
are obligated to pay a portion of future costs in excess of the original
settlement amount. While we have estimated and accrued for expected costs, if
actual incremental costs are higher than expected, we could have to accrue
additional costs and make additional cash payments.


We are currently
launching new products.  If these
products fail, it could have a significant effect on our operating results.

In
our Americas segment, we plan to launch Aspen Edge, a low carbohydrate beer,
and Zima XXX, an extension of our Zima brand, in 2004. We recently launched
Coors Fine Light in our Europe segment. If these brands do not launch
successfully, it could result in a significant impact to our operating results.

Consolidation of
pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could result in
less ability to achieve pricing.

The trend toward
consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is
continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price
negotiating power, which could impact CBL’s ability to obtain favorable pricing
in on-trade (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could
reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers are
beginning to purchase directly more of the products that, in the past, we have
provided as part of our factored business. This consolidation could impact us
negatively.

Due to a high concentration of
unionized workers in the United Kingdom, we could be significantly affected by
labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.

Approximately
31% of CBL’s total workforce is represented by trade unions. Although we
believe relations with our employees are good, more stringent labor laws in the
United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor
disruptions.

We depend exclusively
on one logistics provider in England, Wales and Scotland for distribution of
our CBL products.

We are involved in a joint venture with Exel Logistics
called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for CBL in
England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is
requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of
our product and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely
manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could
ultimately have a negative impact on our operations.

Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging
materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic
management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. By
policy, we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or
speculation.

Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials
prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by
potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we
enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate
swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite
direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net
investments in foreign-currency-denominated operations or translated earnings
of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are British
pound sterling (GBP), Canadian dollar (CAD) and Japanese yen (YEN).

Derivatives are either exchange-traded instruments, or over-the-counter
agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on
over-the-counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated.
All over-the-counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no
lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moody’s). In some instances we and our
counterparties have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair
value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the
posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of
credit if a fair value loss position to us or our counterparties exceeds a
certain amount. At December 28, 2003, no collateral was posted by us or
our counterparties.

At December 28, 2003, we were a party to certain cross currency
swaps totaling 530 million GBP (approximately $774 million at then-prevailing
foreign currency exchange rates). The swaps include an initial exchange of
principal on the settlement date of our 6


/


% private
placement (see Note 4, Debt) and will require final principal exchange 10 years
later. The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for
fixed US dollar interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid
US dollars to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will
provide GBP to the counterparty and receive US dollars. The cross currency
swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the
future GBP interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US
dollar to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between CBL and us.


At December 28, 2003, we were a party to an interest rate swap
agreement related to our 6


/


% fixed rate debt. The
interest rate swap converted $76.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to
floating rates and matures in 2012. We will receive fixed US dollar interest
payments semi-annually at a rate of 6


/


% per annum and
pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread of 0.789% plus the
three-month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a
floating rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception
of the swap. We designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the
changes in the fair value of $76.2 million fixed-rate debt attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rates.

We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related
derivatives using two techniques-sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk. Our
market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are foreign currency forward
contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps.

We use Value-at-Risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate
risk of our cross-currency swaps. The Value-at-Risk provides an estimate of the
level of a one-day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the
fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate-sensitive financial
instruments. The type of Value-at-Risk model used to estimate the maximum
potential one-day loss in the fair value is a variance/covariance method. The
Value-at-Risk model assumes normal market conditions and a 95% confidence
level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value
at risk. The computations used to derive our values take into account various
correlations between currency rates and interest rates. The correlations have
been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and
interest rate changes over the most recent one-year period. We have excluded
anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts
receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the Value-at-Risk
calculation, some of which these instruments are intended to hedge.

The Value-at-Risk calculation is a statistical measure of risk exposure
based on probabilities and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair
value that we may incur. The calculated Value-at-Risk result does not represent
the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. It attempts to represent
the most likely measure of potential loss that may be experienced 95 times out
of 100 due to adverse market events that may occur. Actual future gains and
losses will differ from those estimated by Value-at-Risk because of changes or
differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments, hedge
percentages, timing and other factors.

The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our cross-currency
swaps, derived using the Value-at-Risk model, was $5.9 million and $8.6
million at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. As
we did not enter into the cross currency swaps until the second quarter of
2002, there is no comparable one-day loss in fair value at December 30,
2001. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign
exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. Value changes
due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases
in the value of our inter-company loan, the underlying transaction being
hedged. The hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate
component would be deferred until termination or maturity.


Details of all other market-sensitive derivative and other financial
instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below.
These instruments include foreign currencies, commodity swaps, interest rate
swaps and cross-currency swaps.

December 28, 2003, are as follows (in thousands):

A sensitivity analysis has
been prepared to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects
the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The volatility of
the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be
forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could
differ significantly from the results presented in the table below.

The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of
our derivative and debt portfolio:


ITEM 8

. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

The preparation, integrity and objectivity of the financial statements
and all other financial information included in this annual report are the
responsibility of the management of Adolph Coors Company. The financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, applying estimates based on management’s best judgment where necessary.
Management believes that all material uncertainties have been appropriately
accounted for and disclosed.

The established system of accounting procedures and related internal
controls provide reasonable assurance that the assets are safeguarded against
loss and that the policies and procedures are implemented by qualified
personnel.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent auditors, provide
an objective, independent audit of the consolidated financial statements. Their
accompanying report is based upon an examination conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, including tests of accounting procedures
and records.

The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee composed
of independent, outside directors, monitors the Company’s accounting control
systems and reviews the results of the Company’s auditing activities. The Audit
Committee meets at least quarterly, either separately or jointly, with
representatives of management, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and internal
auditors. To ensure complete independence, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the
Company’s internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee
and may meet with or without the presence of management.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Adolph Coors Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Adolph Coors Company and its subsidiaries at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 28, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

1. 
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Sunday in
December.  Fiscal years ended
December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002, and December 30, 2001,
were all 52-week periods.

Principles of
Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These
accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and
assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are
reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the
extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual
results, our consolidated financial statements are affected.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2002 and 2001 financial
statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in the Americas segment when product is shipped
and the risk of loss transfers to our unrelated customers, which are
principally independent distributors or wholesalers in the United States.
Revenue is recognized in the Europe segment when product is received by our
customers, who are principally independent retailers in the United Kingdom. In
the United Kingdom, excise taxes are included in the purchase price from the
vendor on beverages purchased from third parties for resale (factored brands
business) and are included in our cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. We
pass those costs onto our customers and include the related amounts in our net
sales. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupon
programs are treated as a reduction of sales. Sales of products are for cash or
otherwise agreed upon credit terms.

Outside of unusual circumstances, if product is returned, it is
generally for failure to meet our quality standards, not caused by customer
actions. Products that do not meet our high quality standards are returned and
destroyed. We do not have standard terms that permit return of product. We
estimate the costs for product returns and record those costs in cost of goods
sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income each period. We reduce revenue at
the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is
returned.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold includes beer raw materials, packaging materials
(including promotional packaging), manufacturing costs, plant administrative
support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution
network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound and outbound freight
charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and
internal transfer costs.

Equity Method
Accounting

We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20% -50% owned
investments where we exercise significant influence. These investments
primarily involve equity ownership in captive suppliers of goods and services
for our business. These investments involve operations that manufacture bottles
and cans for our Americas business and transportation services in Europe. They
also include ventures that manufacture, distribute and sell Coors Light in
Canada, Molson branded beers in the United States and Grolsch in the United
Kingdom.

We own a 50.1% interest in a non-consolidated joint venture (Coors
Canada) that we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the
effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under
the operating agreement.

There are no related parties
that own interests in our equity method investments.


Cost
Method Investment

In 1991, we became a limited partner in the Colorado Baseball
Partnership 1993, Ltd. (Baseball Partnership) for an investment of $10.0
million. This commitment was finalized upon the awarding of a National League
Baseball franchise to Colorado in 1991. The initial investment as a limited
partner has been paid and gave us a 17.1% interest in the partnership. We
generally apply the cost method of accounting to less than 20% owned
investments where we do not exercise significant influence. Our use of the cost
method is in accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic
D-46 (EITF D-46) “

Accounting for Limited
Partnership Investments

” as we entered into the limited partnership
agreement in 1991 prior to the effective date for the implementation of EITF
D-46, which was to be applied to all limited partnership investments made after
May 18, 1995. As a limited partner, we take no part in control, management,
direction or operation of the affairs of the Baseball Partnership and have no
power to bind the Baseball Partnership. Profit and loss from operations of the
Baseball Partnership are allocated among the partners in accordance with their
ownership ratios. We did not receive any cash distributions or income in 2003,
2002 or 2001. We believe that the carrying amount of our investment in the
Baseball Partnership is not in excess of fair value.

In July 2003, Coors signed a $2.1 million promissory note with the
Colorado Rockies Baseball Club. Each partner’s loan amount was based on their ownership
percentage. Ownership percentages in the partnership did not change. The note
is due in 20 years and interest will be paid at 5% annually. The principal
amount is recorded in Other Non-Current assets.

Marketing, General
and Administrative

Our marketing, general and administrative expenses consist
predominately of advertising, sales staff costs, and non-manufacturing
administrative and overhead costs. The creative portion of our advertising
activities is expensed as incurred. The costs to produce our advertising and
promotional material are generally expensed when the advertising is first run.
Cooperative advertising expenses are included in marketing, general and
administrative costs. Advertising expense was $588.2 million, $586.2 million
and $465.2 million for years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Prepaid
advertising costs of  $30.6 million
($13.0 million in current and $17.6 million in long-term) and $34.0 million
($12.5 million in current and $21.5 million in long-term) were included in Other
current and Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002, respectively.

Trade Loans

CBL extends loans to retail outlets that sell our brands. Some of these
loans provide for no interest to be payable, and others provide for payment of
a below market interest rate. In return, the retail outlets receive smaller
discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased from us, with the net
result being CBL attaining a market return on the outstanding loan
balance.  Trade loans receivables are
classified as either other receivables or other non-current assets in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At
December 28, 2003, total loans outstanding, net of allowances, was $148.3
million.

We have reclassified a portion of beer revenue into interest income to
reflect a market rate of interest on these notes. In 2003, this amount was
$17.2 million. We have included this interest income in the Europe segment
since it is related solely to the Europe business.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

In the Americas segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit
risk is insignificant as the majority of the Americas accounts receivable
balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom
collection occurs through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the Americas, we
secure substantially all of our product sale credit risk with purchase money
security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other
letters of credit.

Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers, and
because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our
ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide
allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to
collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are
recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer at the point the
account is considered uncollectible. At this time, we record the provision as a
bad debt in Marketing, general and administrative expenses. Provisions are
reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account
is written off.

We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our
customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our
estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables and trade loans could
be materially affected.


Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all
inventories in the United States and on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
in the United Kingdom. Current cost in the United States, determined on the
FIFO method, exceeded LIFO cost by $38.6 million and $39.3 million at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.

We regularly assess the shelf-life of our inventories and write off
those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be sold within
our freshness specifications.

Dispense Assets

CBL owns and maintains the dispense equipment in on-trade retail
outlets. Dispense equipment, which moves the beer from the keg in the cellar to
the glass, is capitalized at cost upon installation and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over an average life of 7 years. Labor and materials used
to install dispense equipment are capitalized and depreciated over 2 years.
Dispense equipment awaiting installation is held in inventory and valued at the
lower of cost or market. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments. The fair value of long-term obligations for derivatives was
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using market interest rates and
does not differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated
financial statements. The fair value of long-term debt exceeds the carrying
value by approximately $86.5 million.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the
functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the
prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of
Other comprehensive income.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We account for employee stock options in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board No.25, “

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

” (APB No. 25). Accordingly, we do not
recognize compensation expense related to employee stock options, since options
are always granted at a price equal to the market price on the day of grant.
See Footnote 6, Stock Option, Restricted Stock Award and Employee Award Plans,
for additional information on our stock options.

We use the intrinsic value method allowed under APB No. 25 when
accounting for our stock-based compensation. The following table illustrates
the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation:


Statement of Cash
Flows Data

Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The fair value of these investments approximates
their carrying value. The following presents our supplemental cash flow
information:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Statement No. 132 Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits (Revised 2003)

This standard revision is
effective immediately and is reflected in Notes 7 and 8. While the standard
does not change the accounting and measurement for pensions and other
postretirement benefits, it does add new disclosures for the footnotes to the
financial statements, including comparative information for prior periods
presented. The disclosures are applicable to both pension and other
postretirement plans. Key additional disclosures include:

•

Plan assets by category.

•

A narrative description of investment policies and
strategies, including target allocation percentages.

•

A narrative description of the basis used to determine the
overall expected long-term rate-of-return on assets.

•

Benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years
and the total for the five years thereafter.

•

The employer’s best estimate of the contributions expected
to be made during the next fiscal year.

•

Interim disclosures (in Form 10-Q) of net periodic benefit
expense and significant revisions to employer contributions paid or expected to
be paid. Companies with investments in “special purpose entities (SPEs)” were
required to implement FIN 46R in 2003; however, companies with VIEs are
permitted to implement in the first quarter of 2004.

FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities – An Interpretation of ARB51

The FASB finalized FIN 46R in
December 2003. FIN 46R expands the scope of ARB51 and various EITFs and
can require consolidation of legal structures, called

“variable interest entities (VIEs).”

Companies with investments in

“Special purpose entities (SPEs)”

were
required to implement FIN46R in 2003; however, Companies with VIEs are
permitted to implement in the first quarter of 2004.  While we do not have SPEs, we do have VIEs that we have
tentatively determined will qualify for consolidation. These include RMMC and
RMBC. We plan to consolidate these VIEs in the first quarter of 2004.  Although
we believe our Grolsch and Coors Canada investments are VIEs, we are still
evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiaries for these investments with
respect to consolidation under FIN 46.  The
most significant impact to our financial statements will be to add the plant
assets of RMMC and RMBC, and totaling approximately $75 million and RMMC debt
of approximately $45 million to our balance sheet. We anticipate minimal impact
to our consolidated net income.  Note 2
discusses our various equity method investments.

SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition

SAB 104 was released in
December 2003.  SAB 104 updates
interpretative guidance in the codification of staff accounting bulletins to
provide consistent accounting guidance on revenue recognition.  We adopted SAB 104 in December 2003 with no
impact to our financial statements or our financial reporting.

Other New Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

(SFAS No. 143), which is applicable to financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Under SFAS No. 143, the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation would be
recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred, with an offsetting
increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the
liability would be accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost
would be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement
of the liability, an entity would either settle the obligation for its recorded
amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement. We adopted this statement
effective December 30, 2002, the beginning of our 2003 fiscal year, with
no material impact to our financial statements.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 149, “

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

(SFAS No. 149), which
is applicable to contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003,
and to hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003.  SFAS No. 149 amends Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133

, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

(SFAS No. 133)
for decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group process,
which required amendments to SFAS No. 133 in connection with financial
instrument-related FASB projects and in connection with other issues that arose
during the implementation phase of SFAS No. 133.  The adoption of this statement on June 30, 2003, did not
have a material impact on our financial statements.

In May
2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150, “

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity

,” which is applicable to financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003.  This statement requires
that certain financial instruments that have previously been classified as
equity but that have characteristics of both equity and liabilities, be
classified as liabilities.  These
instruments include, but are not limited to, instruments that embody
obligations to purchase or issue shares at the settlement date of an
obligation.  Our adoption of this
statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

The FASB Staff issued FASB Staff
Position (FSP) No. 106-1,

“Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003,”

in December 2003.  The FSP is effective for financial
statements of fiscal years ended after December 7, 2003, coincident with the
signing of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (the Act).  The Act provides for,
among other things, a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care
benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. While SFAS 106,

“Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”

explains
the accounting treatment for retire health care plans, the guidance does not
include the accounting for federal subsidies. 
FSP 106-1 permits companies to defer accounting for the Act under SFAS
106 until such time as the effects on the companies’ retirement obligations can
be accurately predicted.  Because our
postretirement medical benefits do not include the features represented by the
Act, we will not have any impact on our future financial statements as a result
of the Act or the issuance of FSP 106-1.


2. Equity Method Investments

Non-Majority Owned
Equity Investments

We have investments in affiliates that are non-majority owned and are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting where we exercise
significant influence. These investments aggregated $185.0 million and $184.8
million at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.
There are no related parties who own interests in our equity method
investments.

Summarized condensed balance sheet information for our non-majority
owned equity method investments are as follows:

Summarized condensed income statement information for our non-majority
owned equity method investments are as follows:

Molson
USA, LLC

In January 2001, we entered into a joint
venture partnership agreement with

Molson and paid $65.0 million for a 49.9% interest in the joint venture. The
venture’s total assets are approximately $15.0 million at December 28,
2003. The joint venture, Molson USA LLC, was formed to import, market, sell and
distribute Molson’s brands of beer in the United States. Approximately
$63.9 million of our initial investment was considered goodwill.  Through December 30, 2001, the goodwill
was being amortized on a straight-line basis over a life of 40 years, and the
amortization expense was $1.6 million.

Our share of the net loss was approximately $2.6 million, $4.8 million
and $2.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This net loss is
included in other income, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income given the immateriality of these results. As a result of these operating losses, we have considered whether our
investment is impaired under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock

,” using the discounted cash flow model and determined
that it was not impaired. The recoverability of our investment in the joint
venture will be further evaluated during 2004 as we reevaluate the assumptions
used in the model based on our continued experience with this business. We have
tentatively determined that, while Molson USA is a variable interest entity as
defined by FIN 46R, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity. We
believe our maximum exposure to loss over our required ownership period to be
approximately $44 million.

Rocky Mountain Bottle Company

We have a 50% interest in a joint venture with Owens, RMBC, to produce
glass bottles at our glass manufacturing facility. RMBC has a contract to
supply our bottle requirements and Owens has a contract to supply the majority
of our bottles for our bottle requirements not met by RMBC. On July 29, 2003,
we signed a new agreement, effective August 1, 2003, with Owens relating to the
operation of our joint venture and the production of glass bottles.  The new agreement has a term of 12
years.  In 2003, we purchased all of the
bottles produced by RMBC, or approximately 1.1 billion bottles. At
December 28, 2003, RMBC’s total assets are $44.8 million.

Purchases under this supply agreement in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
approximately $86 million, $92 million and $92 million, respectively. Cash
distributions received from this joint venture were $12.3 million, $18.2
million and $9.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our share of net
income from this partnership was $7.8 million, $13.2 million and $10.9 million
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is included as a reduction of cost of
goods sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We have
tentatively determined that RMBC is a variable interest entity as defined in
FIN 46R, and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. As a result, we
intend to consolidate RMBC beginning in the first quarter of 2004. We
anticipate minimal impact on consolidated results.


Rocky Mountain Metal Container

Effective January 1,
2002, we became an equal member with Ball Corporation (Ball) in a Colorado
limited liability company, RMMC. Also effective on January 1, 2002, we
entered into a can and end supply agreement with RMMC (the Supply Agreement),
whereby we agreed to purchase substantially all of the can and end requirements
for our Golden Brewery from the venture. On July 1, 2002, RMMC increased
its debt obligations from $20 million to $50 million (such debt is not included
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet). The proceeds have been used to finance
planned capital improvements. RMMC’s debt is secured by its various supply and
access agreements with no recourse to CBC or Ball.  At December 28, 2003, RMMC’s total assets were $78.8 million and
its debt outstanding was approximately $45 million.

Purchases under this supply agreement were approximately $206 million
and $210 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our share of net income from
the limited liability company was approximately $0.1 million and $0.6 million
in 2003 and 2002, respectively, that is included within cost of goods sold on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no distributions
from the venture in 2003 or 2002.  We
have tentatively determined that RMMC is a variable interest entity as defined
in FIN 46R and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. As a result,
we intend to consolidate RMMC beginning in the first quarter of 2004. We expect
minimal impact on consolidated results, although debt of approximately $45
million will be included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Tradeteam

Tradeteam was formed in 1995
by CBL (then Bass Brewers Limited) and Exel Logistics. CBL has a 49.9% interest
in this joint venture. Total assets of the venture are $129.4 million. The
joint venture operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation
fleet for deliveries between the CBL breweries and customers. Tradeteam also
delivers products for other UK brewers. Purchases under this distribution agreement
were approximately $157 million and $131 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  We received $8.8 million
and $8.4 million in distributions in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our share of
the joint venture’s pre-tax income was $9.1 million and $8.3 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively, which is recorded as other income in 2003 (given the
immateriality of its results) and cost of goods sold in 2002 on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. This change in presentation is
due to a change in the entity from primarily a captive supplier of CBL to a
supplier of CBL, as well as independent companies. We have tentatively
determined that Tradeteam is not a variable interest entity as defined in FIN
46R.

Tradeteam had one uncommitted line of credit totaling 15 million GBP,
or approximately $26.6 million based on foreign exchange rates at
December 28, 2003. No amount was outstanding on this line of credit at
December 28, 2003. We do not believe there is a significant exposure to
loss in our current relationship over our expected ownership period.

Grolsch

CBL has a 49% interest in the joint venture company, Grolsch UK Limited
(Grolsch). The Grolsch joint venture involves the marketing of Grolsch branded
beer in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The majority of the Grolsch
branded beer is manufactured by CBL, under a contract brewing arrangement with
the joint venture. CBL sells the beer to the joint venture, which sells the
beer back to CBL (for onward sale to customers) for a price equal to what it
paid CBL, plus a marketing and overhead charge and a profit margin. Total
assets of the Grolsch joint venture are $30.2 million. The profit margin is
considered a royalty paid to the joint venture as the brand owner. We received
$3.2 million and $2.6 million in distributions in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Our share of pre-tax income from the joint venture was $3.6 million and $2.0
million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, which is recorded as a reduction of
cost of goods sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The
joint venture contains provisions permitting the joint venture partner, Royal
Grolsch N.V., subject to notice, to buy our interest in the joint venture.  Although we believe Grolsch is a VIE, we are
still evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary of the Grolsch
investment with respect to consolidation under FIN 46R.

Golden Properties

In 1992, we spun off our wholly owned subsidiary, ACX Technologies,
Inc., which has subsequently changed its name to Graphic Packaging Corporation
(GPC) and merged with an unrelated entity. The new entity is owned
approximately 30% by various Coors family trusts. We are also a limited partner
in a real estate development partnership (Golden Properties) in which a
subsidiary of GPC is the general partner. The partnership owns, develops,
operates and sells certain real estate previously owned directly by us. We
received cash distributions of $0.5 million in 2002 as a return of our capital
account. We did not receive any cash distributions in 2003. We were not
entitled to any of the joint venture income in 2003, 2002 or 2001. We do not
believe Golden Properties is a variable interest entity as defined in FIN 46R.


Majority-Owned,
Non-Consolidated Equity Investment

We have an investment in Coors Canada, an affiliate that is
majority-owned (50.1%), non-consolidated and is accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. This investment aggregated $8.5 million and $6.4 million
at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. There are
no related parties who own interests in this equity method investment.

Summarized condensed balance sheet information for our majority-owned
equity method investment is as follows:

Summarized condensed income
statement information for our majority-owned equity method investments is as
follows:

Coors Canada

Coors Canada, Inc. (CCI), a wholly owned subsidiary, formed a
partnership, Coors Canada, with Molson to market and sell our products in
Canada. Coors Canada began operations January 1, 1998. CCI and Molson have
a 50.1% and 49.9% interest, respectively. CCI’s investment in the partnership
is accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to effective control
of the partnership being shared equally by its partners. The partnership
agreement has an indefinite term and can be canceled at the election of either
partner. Under the partnership agreement, Coors Canada is responsible for marketing
our products in Canada, while the partnership contracts with Molson for
brewing, distribution and sales of these brands. Coors Canada receives an
amount from Molson generally equal to net sales revenue generated from our
brands less production, distribution, sales and overhead costs related to these
sales. CCI received distributions from the partnership of a US dollar
equivalent of approximately $46.7 million, $36.0 million and $27.9 million for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our share of pre-tax income from this
partnership, which was approximately $47.5 million in 2003, $37.0 million in
2002 and $29.2 million in 2001, is included in sales in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Although we believe Coors Canada is a VIE, we are still evaluating
whether we are the primary beneficiary of the Coors Canada partnership with
respect to consolidation under FIN 46R. 
We do not believe there is a significant exposure to loss in our current
relationship over the expected ownership period.

3. Properties

The cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation, depletion
and amortization consists of the following:

Land, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is calculated principally on the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives: 
buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years; and machinery and equipment,
3 to 20 years. Certain equipment held under capital lease is classified as
equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term.
Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for new
facilities and improvements that substantially extend the capacity or useful
life of an asset are capitalized. Start-up costs associated with manufacturing
facilities, but not related to construction, are expensed as incurred. Ordinary
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Natural resource properties are leasehold interests in coal reserves
which as depleted as revenue is recognized.

We capitalize certain software development costs that meet established
criteria, in accordance with Statement of Position, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Systems Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

,” (SOP 98-1). We amortize software costs over 3-5
years. During 2003, we placed into service approximately $43 million of
software assets related to our supply chain processes and systems
implementation. Software development costs not meeting the criteria in SOP
98-1, including system reengineering, are expensed as incurred.


4. Debt

Our total borrowings were composed of the following:

The aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt for the next
five fiscal years are as follows:

Interest

Interest incurred, capitalized and expensed were as follows:

Short-term
Borrowings

Our short-term borrowings
consist of various uncommitted lines of credit.

At December 28, 2003, we had two USD uncommitted lines of credit
totaling $50 million. We had $7.0 million outstanding under these
lines of credit as of December 28, 2003. 
Amounts outstanding under the lines of credit bear interest at a rate
stated by the lenders. At December 28, 2003, the interest rate was 1.80%.

CBL had three uncommitted lines of credit totaling 30.0 million
GBP, or approximately $53.1 million based on foreign exchange rates at
December 28, 2003.  All of the
lines of credit were available to us at December 28, 2003.  These lines of credit bear interest at a
floating rate determined by the lenders. At December 28, 2003, the
interest rate was 4.30% and balances outstanding totaled $11.9 million.

In addition, we have two uncommitted lines of credit totaling 900
million Japanese yen or approximately $8.4 million at December 28, 2003.  At December 28, 2003, interest rates were
below 1% and balances outstanding totaled $2.4 million.

Tradeteam, the joint venture
between CBL and Exel Logistics, had one uncommitted line of credit totaling 15
million GBP, or approximately $26.6 million based on foreign exchange rates at
December 28, 2003. No amount was outstanding on this line of credit at
December 28, 2003, however Tradeteam is required to pay a 0.5% commitment
fee on any undrawn amount.  This line of
credit bears interest at a rate of 1% over GBP LIBOR.

Senior Private
Placement Notes Due July 2005

At December 28, 2003, we had $20.0 million in unsecured
senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 6.95% per annum, all of which was
classified as long-term debt. Interest on the notes is due semi-annually in
January and July.  Our private
placement notes require that we conduct our business with certain restrictions
on indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, asset sales and certain other
types of business activities in which we can engage. We were in compliance with
these requirements at December 28, 2003.



/


%
Senior Notes Due 2012

On May 7, 2002, CBC completed a private placement of
$850 million principal amount of 6


/


% senior notes,
due 2012, with interest payable semi-annually. The notes were priced at 99.596%
of par for a yield to maturity of 6.43%, are unsecured, are not subject to any
sinking fund provision and include a redemption provision (make-whole provision)
if the notes are retired before their scheduled maturity. The redemption price
is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest and (2) the make whole amount of the
notes being redeemed, which is equal to the present value of the principal
amount of the notes and interest to be


redeemed. The notes were issued with registration rights and are
guaranteed by Adolph Coors Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. Net
proceeds from the sale of the notes, after deducting estimated expenses and
underwriting fees, were approximately $841 million. The net proceeds were
used to (1) repay the $750 million of loans outstanding under our
senior unsecured bridge facility, which we entered into in connection with our
acquisition of CBL and (2) to repay approximately $91 million of
outstanding term borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities. We
have also entered into hedges related to these borrowings, which are further
described in Footnote 11, Derivative Instruments.

Simultaneous with the private placement, we entered into a registration
rights agreement pursuant to which we exchanged the unregistered notes for
substantially identical notes registered with the SEC. The exchange of all the
notes was completed on September 16, 2002.

Under the terms of the notes, we must comply with certain restrictions.
These restrictions include restrictions on debt secured by certain types of
mortgages, secured certain threshold percentages of consolidated net tangible
assets, and restrictions on certain types of sale-leaseback transactions. As of
December 28, 2003, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions.

Senior Credit
Facility

At December 28, 2003, we had $86.0 million outstanding in an
unsecured senior credit facility consisting of a US dollar-denominated
amortizing term loan. Amounts outstanding under our term loan bear interest, at
our option, at a rate per annum equal to either an adjusted LIBOR or an
alternate base rate, in each case plus an additional margin. The additional
margin is established based on our investment grade debt rating which is BBB+
(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody’s). If our debt rating changes, the additional margin
is subject to adjustment. Interest is payable quarterly unless the selected
LIBOR is for a time period less than 90 days, in which case the interest
is payable at the end of the time period corresponding to the selected LIBOR.
The interest rate on our US term loan was 1.995% at December 28, 2003.

Our term loan is payable quarterly in arrears beginning June 27,
2003, and matures February 1, 2007. During the year ended
December 28, 2003, we repaid approximately $82.0 million on our US
dollar-denominated amortizing term loan, in addition to amounts paid on our
British pound sterling (GBP)-denominated term loan, which was extinguished
during 2003 (see “Commercial Paper” below). 
This has reduced the scheduled required future amortization amounts
based upon application of payments already made against future payments due as
per the terms of our loan agreement. In connection with the repayments on our
US dollar (USD)-denominated term loan, we accelerated the amortization of fees
associated with the loan, resulting in a $0.4 million charge to interest
expense during 2003. Additional amortization charges were taken with respect to
our early payments on our GBP-denominated term loan. On February 27, 2004,
we repaid an additional $40 million dollars on the term loan.

We and all of our existing and future, direct and indirect, domestic
subsidiaries, other than immaterial domestic subsidiaries, have guaranteed our
term loan borrowings.

Our term loan requires us to meet certain periodic financial tests,
including maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio.
There are also certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens and guarantees;
mergers, consolidations and some types of acquisitions and assets sales; and
certain types of business in which we can engage. As of December 28, 2003,
we were in compliance with all of these restrictions.

Commercial Paper

In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million in commercial
paper, $250 million of which was outstanding as of December 28, 2003. $200
million of our commercial paper balance is classified as long-term, reflecting
our intent to keep this amount outstanding for longer than 360 days and our
ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through our
revolving line of credit. The remaining $50 million is classified as short
term, as our intent is to repay that portion in the next twelve months. As of
December 28, 2003, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings
ranged from 1.24% to 1.27%, with a weighted average of 1.255%.

In May 2003, we increased our unsecured committed credit arrangement
from $300 million to $500 million in order to support our commercial paper
program. As of December 28, 2003, $250 million of the total $500 million
line of credit was being used as a backstop for our commercial paper program.
As of December 28, 2003, all of our line of credit, except the portion
backing commercial paper, was available to us. This line of credit has a
five-year term expiring 2007.

Concurrent with our issuance of commercial paper, we made a payment
against the then-outstanding principal


and interest on our GBP-denominated amortizing term loan of
approximately 181.1 million GBP ($300.3 million at then-prevailing foreign
currency exchange rates) using proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper.
We made final payments on our GBP-denominated term loan of approximately 40.5
million GBP ($65.7 million at then-prevailing foreign currency exchange rates)
using cash from operations during the third quarter of 2003, which fully
extinguished the outstanding balance on this debt instrument. In connection
with these payments, we accelerated the amortization on loan fees related to
this loan on the dates of the payments and expensed approximately $3.1 million
during the year.

Other Long-term Debt

Our other long-term debt
consists of a CBL note payable, denominated in Euros that existed at the time
of the CBL acquisition.  The note bears
interest at 5.39% and matures in October 2005.

Income Taxes

The pre-tax income on which the provision for income taxes was computed
is as follows:

Income tax expense (benefit) includes the following current and
deferred provisions:


Our income tax expense varies from the amount expected by applying the
statutory federal corporate tax rate to income as follows:

Our deferred taxes are composed of the following:

During 2002, in connection with the purchase of CBL, we recorded a
deferred tax liability on the books of CBL and a corresponding deferred tax
asset on the books of the acquiring company for the difference between the
purchase price and historical basis of the CBL assets. Concurrently, we
recorded a $40.0 million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset
to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In 2003, we
evaluated the valuation allowance and determined no adjustment was required.


We do not provide deferred taxes on certain outside basis difference in
our acquired foreign subsidiary’s stock, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL). This
outside basis difference is permanent in duration under SFAS 109 because we do
not intend to take any action that would result in recognizing the gain
inherent in certain book-over-tax basis differences.

We have not presumed any earnings from foreign subsidiaries to be
permanently reinvested under APB No. 23 and, therefore, we have provided
deferred taxes on those amounts. In 2004, Coors will re-evaluate whether to
permanently reinvest part or all of CBL’s current earnings.

Our 2003 effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable completion of
federal tax audits for the years 1996 through 2000, which resulted in a 7%
reduction in our second quarter rate (approximately $7.3 million in lower tax
expense). Based on our current analysis, we believe our remaining income tax
contingency reserves are adequate to address other worldwide income tax issues.

6.
Stock Option, Restricted Stock Award and Employee Award Plans

At December 28, 2003, we had three stock-based compensation plans,
which are described in greater detail below. We apply Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our plans.
Accordingly, as the exercise prices upon grant are equal to quoted market
values, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option portion
of the plans.

The 1990 Plan

The 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan) generally provides for
two types of grants:  stock options and
restricted stock awards for CBC employees. The stock options have a term of 10
years and one-third of the stock option grant vests in each of the three
successive years after the date of grant. Total authorized shares of Class B
common stock for issuance under the 1990 EI Plan were 13.0 million shares at
December 28, 2003.

A summary of the status of the option portion of our 1990 EI Plan is
presented below:


The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

The following table summarizes information
about stock options outstanding at December 28, 2003:

We issued 3,000, 13,000 and 10,750 shares of restricted stock in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively, under the 1990 EI Plan. The term is 10 years and
the shares vest in full at the end of three successive years from the date of
grant.  The compensation cost associated
with these awards is amortized over the vesting period.  Compensation cost associated with these
awards was insignificant in 2003, 2002, and 2001.

In May 2002, the Company
approved a stock award to be issued contingent upon certain debt reduction
milestones as of December 31, 2004. The number of shares that could be
issued under this incentive plan is 96,500. As of December 29, 2003, it
remains unlikely that these milestones will be met. If it becomes probable that
the shares will be issued, we will recognize an expense in that and future
periods.

Equity Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors

The Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (EC Plan)
provides for awards of the Company’s Class B shares of restricted stock or
options for Class B shares. Awards vest after completion of the director’s
annual term.  The compensation cost
associated with the EC Plan is amortized over the director’s term. Compensation
cost associated with this plan was immaterial in 2003

,

2002, and 2001. 
Common stock authorized for the EC Plan as of December 28, 2003,
was 60,000 shares.

7. Employee Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company has US and UK pension plans that cover substantially all
its employees. Benefits for all employees are generally based on salary and
years of service. Plan funding strategies are influenced by employee benefits
laws and tax laws. The Company’s UK plan includes provision for employee
contributions and inflation-based benefit increases for retirees. Total defined
benefit pension plan expense was $38.7 million, $18.6 million and $12.2 million


in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in pension expense
from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the decline in the market value of plan
investments that occurred from 2000 through 2002. Although pension investment
returns were significant in 2003, the impact of the three previous years
returns and a continued decline in interest rates reduced the funded positions
of the plans to a level that resulted in the amortization of previously
unrecognized actuarial losses. In addition, service cost for the UK plan in US
dollars increased due to the appreciation of the GBP against the dollar. The
aggregate funded position of the Company’s plans resulted in the recognition of
an additional minimum liability in 2003 and 2002.

Both US and UK plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with
smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. 
Equity assets are well diversified between international and domestic
investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through
allocations to large-cap, small-cap, and growth and value investments. Relative
allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. For
example, our UK participants are more heavily weighted toward pensioners than
our US participants. Therefore, we have elected a smaller equity percentage in
our UK plan. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of
February 27, 2004 with actual asset allocations at December 28, 2003:

Investment return assumptions for both plans have been determined by
obtaining independent estimates of expected long-term rates of return by asset
class, applying the returns to assets on a weighted average basis and adding an
active management premium where appropriate.

Although we don’t expect any required contributions to other plans, it
is expected that contributions to the US plan during 2004 will be approximately
$40 million, and contributions to the UK plan during 2004 will be approximately
$29 million (UK plan contributions translated to USD at December 31, 2003
rates).


The following represents our net periodic pension cost:


The changes in the projected benefit
obligation and plan assets and the funded status of the pension plans are as
follows:


Pension expense is actuarially calculated annually based on data
available at the beginning of each year. 
Assumptions used in the calculation include the settlement discount rate
selected and disclosed at the end of the previous year as well as other assumptions
detailed in the table below.

Defined Contribution
Plan

US employees are eligible to participate in the Coors Savings and
Investment Plan, a qualified voluntary defined contribution plan. We match 50%
of the employees’ contributions up to 6% of employee compensation. Both
employee and employer contributions are made in cash in accordance with
participant investment elections. There are no minimum amounts that are
required to be invested in CBC stock. Our contributions in 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $6.9 million, $6.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively.

8. Postretirement Benefits

CBC has postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life
insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The plans are not funded.

The obligation under these plans was determined by the application of
the terms of medical and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial
assumptions and health care cost trend rates ranging ratably from 9.50% in 2004
to 5.00% in 2013. The discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 6.00%, 6.75% and 7.25% at
December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001,
respectively.

The changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets of the
postretirement benefit plans are as follows:


Expected Cash Flows

Information about expected cash flows for the postretirement benefit
plan follows:

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have
the following effects:

9. Restructuring and Other Special Charges

We incurred no pre-tax special charges or credits in 2003.

During 2002, we incurred net pretax special charges of $6.3 million.

We recorded special charges of
$2.7 million related to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting,
appraisal and legal fees. Offsetting these charges was a credit of
$2.8 million related to cash payments received on a debt due to us from
our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea. We also incurred net
restructuring charges of $6.4 million primarily related to restructuring
initiatives in our US operations and Golden Brewery business in an effort to
consolidate and lower our future overhead costs. The restructure charges
consisted primarily of employee severance costs, which were paid during 2003.

During 2001, we incurred net pretax special charges of $23.2 million.
We recorded $3.0 million of special charges related to the dissolution of our
existing can and end joint venture as part of the restructuring of this part of
our business. We also entered into a contract with EDS Information Services
(EDS) to outsource certain information


technology functions and incurred outsourcing transition costs of
approximately $14.6 million. We recorded a $2.3 million charge for a portion of
certain production equipment that was abandoned. Offsetting the aforementioned
special charges was a net gain before tax of approximately $2.7 million related
to the sale of the plant and fixed assets of our Spain brewing and commercial
operations, which was closed in 2000. We also incurred net restructuring
charges of $6.0 million, mainly related to the restructuring of our purchasing
organization and certain production areas. These restructurings resulted in the
elimination of approximately 115 positions. These costs consisted primarily of
employee severance costs that were paid in 2001 and 2002.

10. Stock Activity and Earnings Per Share

Capital Stock

On October 3, 2003, at a special meeting of our shareholders,
Class A and Class B shareholders voted to approve a proposal that resulted in a
change of our place of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware.  The change is beneficial to us, due to
Delaware’s comprehensive, widely used and extensively interpreted corporate
law.  The re-incorporation did not
result in any change in our name, headquarters, business, jobs, management,
location of offices or facilities, number of employees, taxes payable to the
State of Colorado, assets, liabilities, or net worth.  However, the par value of all our classes of stock changed to
$0.01 per share, effective in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a
reclassification of amounts from par value to paid-in-capital.

Both classes of common stock have the same rights and privileges,
except for voting, which (with certain limited exceptions) is the sole right of
the holder of Class A common stock.

At December 28, 2003, December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001, 25 million shares of no par value preferred
stock were authorized but unissued.

Pursuant to our by-laws restricted Class B
shares, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, must first be offered
to us for repurchase.  The board of
directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million per year of our
outstanding Class B common stock on the open market during 2002 and 2001;
however, no repurchases of either restricted shares or from the open market
were authorized for 2003. In September 2001, the board of directors
increased the authorized 2001 expenditure limit for the repurchase of
outstanding shares of Class B common stock to $90 million for the remainder of
that fiscal year.  During 2001,
1,506,637 shares were repurchased for approximately $72.3 million under this
stock repurchase program.  No additional
shares were repurchased during 2002 or 2003.

Basic and diluted net income per common share were arrived at using the
calculations outlined below:

The dilutive effects of stock options were determined by applying the
treasury stock method, assuming we were to purchase common shares with the
proceeds from stock option exercises. 
Anti-dilutive securities were not included in our calculation because
the stock options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price
of the common shares during the periods presented.


11. Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in
interest rates, the value of foreign currencies and production and packaging
materials prices. We have established policies and procedures that govern the
strategic management of these exposures through the use of a variety of
financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for
trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation.

Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials
prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by
changes in the underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter
into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps
and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction
of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in
foreign-currency-denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the British Pound
Sterling (GBP), the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the Japanese yen (YEN).

Derivatives are either exchange-traded instruments or over-the-counter
agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on
over-the-counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated.
All over-the-counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no
lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moody’s). In some instances we and our
counterparties have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair
value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the
posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of
credit if a fair value loss position to us or our counterparties exceeds a
certain amount. At December 28, 2003, no collateral was posted by us or
our counterparties.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair
value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets or other
non-current assets. Unrealized loss positions are recorded as other liabilities
or other long-term liabilities.

The majority of all derivatives entered into by the Company qualify
for, and are designated as, foreign-currency cash flow hedges, commodity cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges, including those derivatives hedging foreign
currency denominated firm commitments as per the definitions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

” (SFAS No.
133).

The Company considers whether any provisions in non-derivative
contracts represent “embedded” derivative instruments as described in
SFAS No. 133. As of December 28, 2003, we have concluded that no
“embedded” derivative instruments warrant separate fair value accounting under
SFAS No. 133.

Changes in fair values of outstanding derivatives that are highly
effective as per the definition of SFAS 133 are recorded in other comprehensive
income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the
underlying hedged transaction. In most cases amounts recorded in other
comprehensive income will be released to earnings at maturity of the related
derivative. The consolidated statement of income treatment of effective hedge
results offsets the gains or losses on the underlying exposure.

We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges and commodity cash
flow hedges to either specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or
specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess,
both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be
expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined
that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, we
discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.

We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the
derivative is no longer highly effective, as per SFAS No. 133, in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm
commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the
forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that
designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.


When we discontinue hedge accounting because it is no longer probable
that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period,
the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
affects earnings. However, if it is no longer probable that a forecasted
transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or
within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses
that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized
immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is
discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet until maturity, recognizing
future changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. Any hedge
ineffectiveness, as per SFAS No. 133, is recorded in current-period earnings.
During 2003 and 2002, we recorded an insignificant loss relating to such
ineffectiveness of all derivatives in Other income, net. Effectiveness is
assessed based on the comparison of current forward rates to the rates
established on our hedges.

As of December 28, 2003, $4.9 million of deferred net losses
(net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other
comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the
next twelve months as a result of expected gains or losses on underlying hedged
transactions also being recorded in earnings. Actual amounts ultimately
reclassified to earnings are dependent on the applicable rates in effect when
derivatives contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of
December 28, 2003, the maximum term over which we are hedging exposures to
the variability of cash flows for all forecasted and recorded transactions is
10 years.

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to hedging instruments and do not enter into master netting
arrangements. The counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial
institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A, A2 or better.
However, this does not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these
institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in
such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as
contracted. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit
guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to
prescribed guidelines. We utilize a portfolio of financial institutions either
headquartered or operating in the same countries we conduct our business. As a
result of the above considerations, we consider the risk of counterparty
default to be minimal.

On May 7, 2002, we entered
into certain cross currency swaps totaling 530 million GBP  (approximately $774 million at the date
of entering the transaction). The swaps included an initial exchange of
principal on the settlement date of our 6


/


% private
placement fixed rate debt (see Note 4, Debt) and will require final
principal exchange 10 years later. The swaps also call for an exchange of
fixed GBP interest payments for fixed US dollar interest receipts. At the
initial principal exchange, we paid US dollars to a counterparty and received
GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive
US dollars. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges
of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal receipts that
results from changes in the US dollar to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany
loan between us and our Europe subsidiary.

On the same day as the settlement of our private placement offering and
initial exchange of principal amounts associated with our swap transactions, we
were required to settle our previously established forward sale of
530 million GBP. The settlement of all these transactions in aggregate
resulted in a foreign exchange loss of approximately $30 million, the
majority of which was offset by a foreign exchange gain on our intercompany
loan.

On May 28, 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
related to our 6


/


% fixed rate debt. The interest rate
swap converted $76.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating
rates and matures in 2012. We will receive fixed US dollar interest payments
semi-annually at a rate of 6


/


% per annum and pay a
rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread of 0.789% plus the
three-month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a
floating interest rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception
of the swap. We designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the
changes in the fair value of the $76.2 million fixed rate debt
attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates.


12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

13. Segment and Geographic Information

Prior to our acquisition of CBL, we reported results of operations as
one segment. We now categorize our operations into two operating segments: the
Americas and Europe. These segments are managed by separate operating teams,
even though both consist primarily of the manufacture, marketing, and sale of
beer and other beverage products.

The Americas segment primarily consists of production, marketing and
sales of the Coors family of brands in the United States and its territories.
This segment also includes the Coors Light business in Canada that is conducted
through a partnership investment with Molson and the sale of Molson products in
the United States that is conducted through a joint venture investment with
Molson. There are also a small amount of CBC products that are exported and
sold outside of the United States and its possessions, excluding Europe,
included in the Americas.

The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL
brands principally in the United Kingdom but also in other parts of the world,
our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of
Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and our joint venture
arrangement with Tradeteam for the physical distribution of products throughout
Great Britain.

Corporate unallocated expenses currently consist of interest, taxes and
certain other corporate costs in both the United States and the United Kingdom.
The large majority of these corporate costs relate to finance and other
administrative functions.


No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is
shown in the following table:

(1)  Depreciation, depletion and amortization amounts do not
reflect amortization of bond discounts, fees, or other debt-related items.
Capital expenditures include additions to properties and intangible assets.

(2)  Related primarily to interest on Trade Loans.


The following tables represent sales and long-lived assets by
geographic segment:

(1)  Net sales attributed to geographic areas is based on the
location of the customer.

(2)  Long-lived assets include tangible assets.

14. Commitments and Contingencies

Letters of Credit

As of December 28, 2003, we had approximately $9.1 million
outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions. These letters
expire at different points in 2004, but contain a feature that automatically
renews the letters for an additional year if no cancellation notice is
submitted. These letters of credit are being maintained as security for
reimbursements to insurance companies, for deductibles or retention payments
made on our behalf, and for operations of underground storage tanks.

Power Supplies

In 1995, Coors Energy Company (CEC), a wholly owned subsidiary, entered
into a 10-year agreement to purchase 100% of the Company’s Golden facility’s
coal requirements from Appalachian Fuels (formerly Bowie Resources Ltd.). The
coal then is sold to Trigen-Nations Energy Company, L.L.L.P. (Trigen). We have
an agreement to purchase the electricity and steam needed to operate the
brewery’s Golden facilities through 2020 from Trigen. Our financial commitment
under this agreement is divided between a fixed, non-cancelable cost, which
adjusts annually for inflation, and a variable cost, which is generally based
on fuel cost and our electricity and steam use. Total purchases, fixed and
variable, under this contract in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $32.1 million, $28.0
million, and $29.8 million, respectively.

Supply Contracts

We have various long-term supply contracts with unaffiliated third
parties and our joint ventures to purchase materials used in production and
packaging, such as starch, cans, ends and glass. The supply contracts provide
that we purchase certain minimum levels of materials throughout the terms of
the contracts. The approximate future purchase commitments under these supply
contracts are:


Our total purchases under these contracts in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
approximately $544.9 million, $583.0 million, and $243.3 million, respectively.

Third-Party Logistics Contract

We are consolidating portions of our warehousing into two separate
contracts with Exel Logistics, Inc. The contracts provide for warehousing
services in Ontario, California and Golden, Colorado under seven and five year
operating agreements, respectively. We have committed to $2.6 million and $5.8
million in operating expenses to these contracts in 2003. Annual reviews of the
scope of services with Exel Logistics will determine pricing in future years,
limited to 3% increases annually.

England and Wales
Distribution Contract and Joint Venture Agreement

Tradeteam Ltd., the joint venture between CBL and Exel Logistics, has
an exclusive contract with CBL to provide distribution services in England and
Wales until at least 2010. The approximate future financial commitments under
the distribution contract are as follows:

The financial commitments on termination of the distribution agreement
are to essentially take over property, assets and people used by Tradeteam to
deliver the service to CBL, paying Tradeteam’s net book value for assets
acquired.

Graphic Packaging Corporation

We have a packaging supply agreement with a subsidiary of Graphic
Packaging Corporation (GPC) under which we purchase our paperboard
requirements. Our purchases under the packaging agreement in 2003, 2002 and
2001 totaled approximately $106.4 million, $111 million and $125 million,
respectively. We expect purchases in 2004 to be approximately the same as 2003.
Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates accounts payable on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $5.0 million and $0.8 million as of
December 28, 2003 and December 29 2002, respectively.  See Item 13(b), Certain Business
Relationships, for further information.

Advertising and
Promotions

We have various long-term non-cancelable commitments for advertising
and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues
and events. At December 28, 2003, the future commitments are as follows:


Leases

We lease certain office
facilities and operating equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable
agreements accounted for as operating leases. 
Future minimum lease payments under scheduled operating leases that have
initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Total rent expense was $14.3 million, $22.5 million and $11.8 million
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Environmental

When we determine that it is probable that a liability for
environmental matters or other legal actions exists and the amount of the loss
is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the future costs are recorded as a
liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life, increase the
capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company-owned assets or are
incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be
capitalized.  Other environmental costs
are expensed when incurred.

We are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Lowry
Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver
(Denver), and is managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste
Management). In 1990, we recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, a
portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with
Denver and Waste Management regarding the then outstanding litigation. Our
settlement was based on an assumed cost of $120 million (in 1992 adjusted
dollars). We are obligated to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that
amount.

In January 2004, Waste Management provided us with updated annual
cost estimates through 2032. We reviewed these cost estimates, in conjunction with
a third-party expert, in the assessment of our accrual related to this issue.
We used certain assumptions that differ from Waste Management’s estimates to
assess our expected liability. Our expected liability (based on the $120
million threshold being met) is based on our and the third-party’s best
estimates available.

The assumptions used are as follows:

•

trust management
costs will be accrued as incurred,

•

income taxes,
which we believe not to be an included cost, are not included in the assumptions,

•

a 2% inflation
rate for future costs, and

•

certain
operations and maintenance costs were discounted using a 4.98% risk-free rate
of return.

Based on these assumptions, the present value and gross amount of the
discounted costs are approximately $1.4  million and $3.3 million,
respectively. Accordingly, we believe that the existing accrual is adequate as
of December 28, 2003.  We did not
assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of our
liability.

Considering the estimates extend through the year 2032 and the related
uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial actions may be
required by the EPA, new technologies, and what costs are included in the
determination of when the $120 million threshold is reached, the estimate
of our liability may change as facts further develop. We cannot predict the
amount of any such change, but additional accruals in the future are possible.

We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in
Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may
also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware.


From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a PRP
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances
have allegedly been released into the environment. We cannot predict with
certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total cost, the extent
to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time
necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage.

While we cannot predict the eventual aggregate cost for environmental and
related matters in which we are currently involved, we believe that any
payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in
amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results,
cash flows or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate
reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable.

Litigation

Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have
been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage
consumption. The suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege
that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to “children and other
underage consumers.” In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class
of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will
vigorously defend this litigation and it is not possible at this time to
estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in these lawsuits.

We are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or
determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review
with legal counsel, none of these disputes and legal actions is expected to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters, including the
above-described advertising practices case, may arise from time to time that
may harm our business.

Insurance

We are self-insured for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of
employee health insurance programs, as well as workers’ compensation, general
liability, automobile liability and property insurance deductibles or
retentions. During 2003 we fully insured future risks for long-term disability,
and, in most states, workers’ compensation, but maintained a self-insured
position for workers’ compensation for certain self-insured states and for
claims incurred prior to the inception of the insurance coverage in Colorado in
1997.

Regulatory
Compliance Review

We are in the process of conducting a regulatory compliance review of
certain trading practices.  The review
has not been concluded.  In accordance
with SFAS No. 5,

“Accounting for
Contingencies”,

the company believes, at this time, it is not
probable that a liability will arise from the review.  While matters of this nature are always subject to uncertainty,
any possible liability is not expected to be material.


15. Quarterly Financial Information
(Unaudited)

The following summarizes selected quarterly financial information for
each of the two years in the period ended December 28, 2003:

16. Coors Brewers Limited Acquisition

On February 2, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of
Bass Holdings Ltd. and certain other intangible assets from Interbrew, for
a total purchase price of 1.2 billion GBP (approximately $1.7 billion
at then prevailing exchange rates), plus associated fees and expenses. The
acquisition supported one of our key strategic goals of growing our beer
business internationally to broaden our geographic platform; diversify
revenues, profits and cash flows and increase our brand portfolio, which we
believe will significantly enhance our competitive position in a consolidating
worldwide beer industry.

One of the factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted
in the recognition of goodwill was the existence of financial and operating
synergies. In addition to these synergies, there were a number of other factors
– including the existence of a strong management team, a proven track record of
introducing and marketing successful brands, an efficient sales and
distribution system, complementary products and a good sales force.

The business, renamed CBL,
included the majority of the assets that previously made up Bass Brewers, including
the Carling, Worthington and Caffrey’s beer brands; the United Kingdom and
Republic of Ireland distribution rights to Grolsch (via and subject to the
continuation of a joint venture arrangement, in which CBL has a 49% interest,
with Royal Grolsch N.V.); several other beer and flavored-alcohol beverage
brands; related brewing and malting facilities in the United Kingdom; and a
49.9% interest in the distribution logistics provider, Tradeteam. CBL is the
second-largest brewer in the United Kingdom based on total beer volume, and
Carling lager is the best-selling beer brand in the United Kingdom. The brand
rights for Carling, which is the largest acquired brand by volume, are mainly
for territories in


Europe. The addition of CBL creates a stronger, broader, more
diversified company in a highly competitive and consolidating global beer
market.

The results of CBL operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since February 2, 2002, the date of acquisition. The
following table shows the unaudited proforma results of our consolidated
operations for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002, as if the business
combination had occurred at the beginning of that fiscal year, as well as comparative
actual consolidated results for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003,
when we owned CBL for the whole period. The 2002 proforma results are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if
the business combination had occurred at the beginning of that year and are not
intended to be indicative of future results of operations.

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

Of the $415 million of acquired intangible assets, approximately
$390 million has been assigned to brand names and distribution rights. The
remaining $25 million was assigned to patents and technology and
distribution channels. Approximately $286 million of the $390 million
brand name and distribution rights value has been determined to have an indefinite
life and accordingly will not be amortized. The remaining $104 million
brand names and distribution rights value will be amortized over a weighted
average useful life of approximately 12 years. The $25 million value
for patents and technology and distribution channels will be amortized over a
weighted average useful life of approximately 8 years.

We engaged the services of a professional appraiser to assist us in
determining the value of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of
CBL. The fair value of the acquired intangible brand assets were determined
primarily from the discounted value of projected cash flows. A weighted average
cost of capital of 8.75% was used to discount projected cash flows. Cash flows
were projected using management’s best estimates of sales growth or declines
for each brand over its expected life. The lives of the assets were determined
by an evaluation of significant factors that could impact the life of the
brand.

The cost approach was used to determine the value of the customer base
using the estimated cost to recruit a customer. Technology, unfavorable
leaseholds, contracts and other less significant intangible assets were valued
using a present value approach of the returns or costs of the underlying
assets. Goodwill was valued using the residual method.


We finalized the purchase price accounting relative to the CBL
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002. 
Significant purchase price adjustments included an $83.4 million
increase of goodwill related to the pension plan actuarial valuation, a $2.7
million decrease of goodwill for certain restructuring plans and a $4.3 million
increase of goodwill for adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired.

Goodwill of $637 million was assigned to the Europe and Americas
segments in the amounts of approximately $522 million and
$115 million, respectively (See Note 17, Goodwill and Intangible Assets,
for further discussion of allocation). It is currently expected that none of
the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.  A valuation allowance of approximately $40 million was
recorded against deferred tax assets arising from the acquisition.

In 2002, we closed our Cape Hill brewery and Alloa malting facility
acquired as part of CBL.  The Alloa
malting facility was closed in June 2002 and was sold in July 2002
for $375,000.  The majority of the
production at the Cape Hill brewery related to brands that were retained by
Interbrew, the previous owner of CBL. Liabilities recorded as part of purchase
price accounting are (in millions):

Closure of the Cape Hill brewery commenced in July 2002 with the
shut down of the kegging line. All production ceased in December 2002, at
which time the assets were re-classified as held-for-sale. The site is
currently being held for sale at a carrying value of approximately $39 million.
The payment of severance and other termination benefits started in
July 2002 with the closure of the kegging line, and were substantially completed
in 2003.  We have a potential buyer and
we expect disposition to be completed during 2005, possibly earlier, depending
on obtaining agreement with government authorities on zoning issues. The costs
associated with these closures that were paid during 2003 and 2002 consisted
predominately of severance costs and approximated $5.5 million and $3.2
million, respectively.

We funded the acquisition with approximately $150 million of cash
on hand and approximately $1.55 billion of debt as described below at the
prevailing exchange rate as of the date of acquisition:

In conjunction with the term loan and bridge facility, we incurred
financing fees of approximately $9.0 million and $0.5 million,
respectively. These fees were amortized over the respective terms of the
borrowings using the effective interest method. On May 7, 2002, we repaid
our nine-month bridge facility through the issuance of long-term financing. We
also repaid the balance of our GBP-denominated amortizing term loan during
2003. See Note 4, Debt, for further information about debt-related activity.


17. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The following tables present details of our intangible assets, other
than goodwill, as of December 28, 2003:

Based on December 2003 average foreign exchange rates, the
estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:

Amortization expense of intangible assets was $22.2 million and
$20.9 million for the years ended December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively.

Upon the acquisition of CBL on February 2, 2002, we recorded $637
million of goodwill. The total goodwill was determined using the residual
method under SFAS No. 141 and 142. This goodwill was allocated between our
Europe and Americas segments based on which segment would benefit from certain
synergies created by the acquisition. A portion of the acquired goodwill was
attributable to operating and financial synergies resulting from the
combination. The financial synergy goodwill was calculated by comparing the
risk premiums expected by investors associated with the CBC business with and
without the CBL acquisition. This synergy was then associated with the segments
based on an analysis of the Europe segment with and without the weighted
average cost of capital differential as well as the two segments’ relative
earnings contributions. Operating synergies were allocated to reporting units
based on where the savings were expected to occur. Application of this
methodology resulted is the following allocations:


As of December 28, 2003, goodwill was allocated between our
reportable segments as follows:

Changes in our goodwill from
December 29, 2002 to December 28, 2003, were the result of foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes have been made to the 2002
segmented goodwill balances, which are not reallocations between segments, but
rather the reflection of foreign currency adjustments, in order to conform to
current year presentation.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

(SFAS 142), stipulates that we are required to perform goodwill and other
intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more
frequently in certain circumstances. We completed the required impairment
testing of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142 during the third
quarter of 2003 and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset was
impaired.

In addition, goodwill related to our joint venture investment with
Molson was evaluated during 2003 under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock

, (APB No. 18), and found not to be
impaired. Since our acquisition of the joint venture interest, the venture has
seen significant volume gains, but its operating results have not met our
original expectations. We and our partners continue to evaluate and refine the
venture’s strategy for 2004 and beyond, and the implications that future
assumptions for volume, costs and profit may have on our investment valuation.

18. Subsequent Events

Effective January 1, 2004, we revised our contract with Electronic
Data Systems (EDS) to extend EDS’ information technology services to include
our Europe segment.  This effectively
globalizes the services that EDS provides to our company through the year 2010,
with an option to continue the services through 2012. As with the agreement existing
at December 28, 2003, the new agreement will convert fixed costs into
variable costs in both our Americas and Europe segments. We continue to believe
that our arrangement with EDS allows us to focus on our core business while
having access to the expertise and resources of a world-class information
technology provider.

During the first quarter of 2004, we experienced an accident at our
Golden brewery operation that resulted in injuries to several employees,
extensive property damage, and a shut-down of the brewery operation for a short
amount of time. We maintain insurance coverage for these types of events,
including coverage for costs we incurred to avoid any business interruption. We
anticipate that our 2004 results will be negatively impacted by a minimum of
$2.0 million to $3.0 million, largely representing our insurance deductibles.
We are still evaluating any environmental impact that may have resulted from
the accident.

19. Supplemental Guarantor Information

On May 7, 2002, our wholly owned subsidiary, CBC (Issuer),
completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 6


/


%
Senior notes due 2012. The notes were issued with registration rights and were
guaranteed on a senior and unsecured basis by Adolph Coors Company (Parent Guarantor)
and certain domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors). The guarantees are
full and unconditional, and joint and several. A significant amount of the
Issuer’s income and cash flow is generated by its subsidiaries. As a result,
funds necessary to meet the Issuer’s debt service obligations are provided in
large part by distributions or advances from its subsidiaries. Under certain
circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, as well as our financial
condition and operating requirements and those of certain domestic
subsidiaries, could limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash for the purpose
of meeting its debt service obligation including the payment of principal and
interest on the notes.

Simultaneously with the private placement, we entered into a
registration rights agreement pursuant to which we registered the exchange of
the notes for substantially identical notes. The exchange of all the notes was
completed on September 16, 2002.


The following information sets forth our Condensed Consolidating
Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 and the
Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the fiscal
years ended December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002, and
December 30, 2001.  Investments in
our subsidiaries are accounted for on the equity method; accordingly, entries
necessary to consolidate the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and all of its
subsidiaries are reflected in the elimination column. Separate complete
financial statements of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors would not
provide additional material information that would be useful in assessing their
financial composition.

Item 9

. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9a

. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures.

Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to


allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such
controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable
assurance regarding management’s control objectives. Also, we have investments
in certain unconsolidated entities that we do not control or manage.
Consequently, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such
entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with
respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. The Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have
reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 28, 2003 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.

Changes in internal
control over financial reporting.

The Company had
a change in the internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. We
implemented a new automated supply chain system within our Americas segment
that impacted financial processes and controls in the areas of billing, excise
taxes, freight, and inventories. The difficulties we have experienced with the
system implementation have required us to design and use mitigating control
procedures to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented. We
will continue to rely on mitigating controls until the financial processes and
system controls as originally designed are fully operational, at which point we
expect to have controls that are improved from before the new system
implementation.

(3) The
amounts shown in this column are primarily attributable to the officer life
insurance other than group life and bonus amounts unrelated to the annual CBC
Incentive Plan shown in the Bonus column.

We provide term officer life insurance for all the named active
executives. The officer’s life insurance provides six times the executive base
salary until retirement when the benefit terminates. The 2003 annual premium
benefit for each executive was: W. Leo Kiely III, $65,390; Peter H. Coors, $17,534;
Timothy V. Wolf, $5,993; Peter M. R. Kendall, $19,091 and Robert M. Reese,
$6,669.

Peter M. R. Kendall received $371,605 as part of a benefits package we
gave him due to his international assignment in 2003. Robert M. Reese received
a $100,000 signing bonus upon starting with the company in 2002.  These dollar amounts are included in “other
compensation” above in those years.

In response to Code Section 162 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993, we appointed a special compensation committee of the board to approve and
monitor performance criteria in certain performance-based executive
compensation plans for 2002.


II. Option/SAR Grants Table

Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year

(1) Grants vest one-third in each of the three successive years after
the date of grant. As of December 30, 2003, no 2003 grants were vested because
of the one-year vesting requirement; however, they will vest 33-1/3% on the
one-year anniversary of the grant dates.

IV. Pension Plan Table

The following table sets forth annual retirement benefits for representative
years of service and average annual earnings.

(1) Maximum permissible benefit under ERISA from the qualified
retirement income plan for 2003 was $160,000. Annual compensation exceeding
$200,000 is not considered in computing the maximum permissible benefit under
the qualified plan. We have a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan to
provide full accrued benefits to all employees in excess of Internal Revenue
Service maximums.

Annual compensation covered by
the qualified and non-qualified retirement plans and credited years of service
for the named executive officers are as follows: W. Leo Kiely III, $782,000 and
10 years; Peter H. Coors, $753,000 and 32 years; Timothy V. Wolf, $419,500 and
9 years; Peter M. R. Kendall, $396,840 and 6 years; and Robert M. Reese,
$357,700 and 2 years.

Our principal retirement income plan is a defined benefit plan. The
amount of contribution for officers is not included in the above table since
total plan contributions cannot be readily allocated to individual employees.
Covered compensation is defined as the total base salary (average of three highest
consecutive years out of the last 10) of employees participating in the plan,
including commissions but excluding bonuses and overtime pay. Compensation also
includes amounts deferred by the individual under Internal Revenue Code Section
401(k) and any amounts deferred into a plan under Internal Revenue Code Section
125. Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. An employee with at least 5
years of vesting service may retire as early as age 55. Benefits are reduced
for early


retirement based on an employee’s age and years of service at
retirement; however, benefits are not reduced if (1) the employee is at least
age 62 when payments commence; or (2) the employee’s age plus years of service
equal at least 85 and the employee has worked for us at least 25 years and has
reached the age of 55. The amount of pension actuarially accrued under the
pension formula is based on a single life annuity.

In addition to the annual benefit from the qualified retirement plan,
Peter H. Coors is covered by a salary continuation agreement. This agreement
provides for a lump sum cash payment to the officer upon normal retirement in
an amount actuarially equivalent in value to 30% of the officer’s last annual
base salary, payable for the remainder of the officer’s life, but not less than
10 years. The interest rate used in calculating the lump sum is determined
using 80% of the annual average yield of the 10-year Treasury constant
maturities for the month preceding the month of retirement. Using 2003 eligible
salary amounts as representative of the last annual base salary, the estimated
lump sum amount for Peter H. Coors would be based upon an annual benefit of
$225,900, paid upon normal retirement.

V. Compensation of Directors

The non-employee (NE) directors’ annual retainer was raised from
$42,000 to $45,000 in May 2003.  NE
directors also received a grant of 2,000 options each in 2003.

In 2003, the NE members of the Board of Directors were each paid 5
months of their annual 2002-2003 retainer, or $17,500, plus 7 months of their
2003-2004 retainer, or $26,250, as well as reimbursement of expenses incurred
to perform their duties as directors. Pamela Patsley, Chair of our Audit
Committee, and Dr. Albert Yates, Chair of our Compensation and Human Resources
Committee, received additional payments of $7,000 each for their services as
committee chairs.  Directors who are our
full-time employees receive $18,000 annually for each Board term of May to May.
All directors are reimbursed for any expenses incurred while attending board or
committee meetings and in connection with any other company business.

VI.
Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment Arrangements

Except for agreements with certain of our executive officers, including
the named active executive officers, relating to their employment upon a change
of control of our company, we have no agreements with executives providing
employment for a set period. The change in control agreements, which apply to
certain officers of CBC, generally provide that for a period of two years
following a change of control as defined in the agreements, the officer will be
entitled to certain compensation upon certain triggering events. These events
include termination without cause, resignation for good reason or resignation
by the officer for any reason during a 30-day window beginning one year after a
change of control. Upon a triggering event, officers would be paid a multiple
of their annual salary and bonus, plus health, pension and life insurance
benefits for additional years. For the Chairman and the Chief Executive
Officer, the compensation would equal three times annual salary and bonus, plus
benefits for the equivalent of three years coverage, plus three years credit
for additional service toward pension benefits. All other officers, including
named active officers, who are party to these agreements would receive two
times annual salary and bonus, plus two years equivalent benefit coverage, plus
credit for two years additional service toward pension benefits.

VII.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Dr. Albert C. Yates, Chairman, and Franklin W. Hobbs served on the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee during 2003. In addition, Wayne R.
Sanders served on the Committee until May 2003, when Charles M. Herington was
appointed to the Committee.

Executive
Compensation Report of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee

The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has the responsibility
of making recommendations and providing assistance to the Board of Directors on
compensation and benefit programs for the Company’s employee and non-employee
directors, officers and employees.

Compensation Philosophy

The Committee adheres to several guiding principles in carrying out its
responsibilities:

Total compensation should reward individual, team and corporate
performance and provide incentive for


enhancement of shareholder value. Variable pay awards (short- and
long-term) will correlate closely (up and down) with business and individual
performance.

Our total reward package encompasses base and variable pay, equity
programs, benefits and personal growth

.

The Company provides a base salary that will maintain its competitive market
position. The Company offers an annual incentive opportunity that aligns
corporate growth objectives and performance with individual achievements.

Performance measurement reflects calculated
achievement levels and fact-based judgment. The relative emphasis of each are
set by local management.

At more senior levels of leadership, focus is on a combination of short
and long term performance.  Over time,
top performers should receive above average compensation and above median variable
pay commensurate with Company results.

Along
with our culture and other management systems, equity rewards will help us
drive value- added performance for the Company, business units, and
individuals. Equity will be used to align employees and our shareholders and
will be focused on those individuals with the greatest ability to impact
results.

The Committee considers several factors when determining compensation
for executive officers:

Overall Company Performance

In addition to its current knowledge of Company operations through
participation at regular Board meetings, the Committee reviews the Company
score card, which includes such items as annual sales, cost of goods sold,
earnings, cash flow per share growth, debt reduction goals, market share gains,
progress toward long-term objectives, and various qualitative factors relating
to Company performance. There is no set weighting of these variables as applied
to individual executive positions. Each year, management sets specific
performance targets for the Company and certain business units for each of the
categories set forth above. In addition, certain business units have specific
targets in addition to overall Company performance that are a factor in rating
the performance of the executive officers and other management personnel
responsible for those units. These targets generally provide ranges below which
no bonus compensation will be paid, and ranges for which incentive compensation
will be paid, but which will vary depending on the level of performance within
those ranges. The committee reviews the performance targets annually, makes
recommendations, and determines whether to approve management’s targets and
recommended salary and bonus levels.

Individual Performance

The Committee considers, in addition to business results, the
executive’s achievement of various other managerial objectives and personal
development goals.

Competitive Compensation

Management benchmarks executives against companies with similar
revenues, as well as against companies in similar industries.

Salary

The Company does not have an employment agreement with Mr. Peter Coors,
Mr. Leo Kiely or any of its other executive officers, except for certain
arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. In setting
base salaries the Committee generally considers the overall financial
performance of the Company as well as external and internal pay equity. Actual
salary determination is subjective. We believe Mr. Kiely’s compensation is
conservative relative to the market for CEOs in the comparable group of
companies.

Salaries for other executive officers were targeted at market level in
line with our overall compensation philosophy.


Bonus

The Company pays incentive (bonus) compensation to all of its officers
and most employees, except certain employees under collective bargaining
agreements, in accordance with prescribed plans.  The plans are reviewed and approved by the Committee annually.
These Plans authorize payment of cash bonuses to participants based on a
pre-established range of Company or business unit performance goals for
designated performance periods. The incentive amount is calculated based on a
percentage of the participant’s salary, depending on grade level and position,
and is divided into individual and company-based components. Mr. Kiely’s bonus
is based 75% on Company performance and 25% on achivement of debt paydown
targets. Bonuses for higher ranked employees are weighted more in favor of Company
performance and less individual performance. In addition, performance in some
cases may include targets not totally within the control of the participant in
order to incorporate cross-functional goals.

In February 2004, the Committee certified the 2003 results against
established performance goals and approved individual bonuses for all executive
officers and employees who participate in the incentive plans. However, no
bonus was paid for the Company performance portion of the formula because the Company
did not meet its performance targets. This resulted in lower total bonus
payments.

Long-Term Incentives

Stock option and restricted share awards are the Company’s current
long-term incentives. Stock option awards are made to approximately 573 middle
and upper level managers, including Mr. Kiely and the other executive officers.
The number of options granted is a fixed number based on job level and market
total compensation. Options normally vest over three years, one-third on each
anniversary date of the grant.

In 2003, the Committee granted Mr. Kiely options for 150,000 shares
under the 1990 Equity Incentive Stock Plan.

Policy on Deductibility of Compensation Expenses

The Company is not allowed a deduction for certain compensation paid to
certain executive officers in excess of $1 million, except to the extent such
excess constitutes performance-based compensation. The Committee considers its
primary goal to be the design of compensation strategies that further the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders. To the extent they are not
inconsistent with that goal, the Committee will attempt where practical to use
compensation policies and programs that preserve the deductibility of
compensation expenses.

VIII. 
Audit Committee Report

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is composed of a minimum
of three directors who are independent as required by the listings standards of
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). For 2003, the Audit Committee consisted of
Pamela H. Patsley, Wayne R. Sanders and Franklin Hobbs. The Board of Directors
determined in 2003 that Ms. Patsley, Mr. Hobbs and Mr. Sanders each are “audit
committee financial experts” as defined by the SEC regulations, implementing
Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Board of Directors has
determined that each are “independent” as defined by current listing standards
of the NYSE.

The Committee operates under a written charter which is reviewed
annually and adopted by the committee. The Audit Committee’s primary duties and
responsibilities are to:

•

monitor the integrity of our financial reporting process, the system of
internal controls and significant legal matters and ethics;

•

review and appraise the independence and performance of our internal auditors
and independent accountants; and

•

provide an open avenue of communication for the independent accountants,
financial and senior management, internal auditors and the board of directors.

The Committee held four regular meetings and eight teleconferences
during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003. Discussions were held with
management and the independent auditors. Management represented to the
Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Committee has
reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with our
management and the independent auditors. The Committee has discussed with the
independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
Standards (SAS) No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended.

The Audit Committee has ultimate authority and responsibility to
select, evaluate, and when appropriate, replace the Company’s independent
auditor.  The Committee has discussed
with the independent auditors the auditors’ independence, including the matters
in the written disclosures and the letter we received from the auditors, as
required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence
Discussions with Audit Committees. The fees billed by independent auditors for
non-audit services were approved by the Audit Committee and were also
considered in the discussions of independence.

The Audit Committee also discussed with the Company’s senior management
and independent auditors the process used for certifications by the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for certain of the Company’s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Following the Committee’s reviews and discussions with management
and the independent auditor, the Committee recommended that the Board of
Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the
Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2003.

In February 2004, Randall Oliphant, a new director, was added to the
Audit Committee.
