PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a)  General Development of
Business

General

As used herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, “Altria Group, Inc.”
refers to the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Altria family of companies and the term “ALG” refers solely to the parent company. ALG’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Philip Morris USA Inc.
(“PM USA”) and Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products. ALG’s majority owned (89.0% as of December 31, 2006) subsidiary Kraft Foods Inc.
(“Kraft”) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of packaged foods and beverages. Philip Morris Capital Corporation (“PMCC”), another wholly-owned subsidiary, maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases. During
2003, PMCC shifted its strategic focus from an emphasis on the growth of its portfolio of finance leases through new investments to one of maximizing investment gains and generating cash flows from its existing portfolio of finance assets. In
addition, at December 31, 2006, ALG had a 28.6% economic and voting interest in SABMiller plc (“SABMiller”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of various beer products.

Kraft Spin-Off:

On January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors announced that Altria Group, Inc. plans to spin off all of its remaining interest
(89.0%) in Kraft on a pro rata basis to Altria Group, Inc. stockholders in a tax-free distribution. The distribution of all the Kraft shares owned by Altria Group, Inc. will be made on March 30, 2007 (“Distribution Date”), to
Altria Group, Inc. stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2007 (“Record Date”). The exact distribution ratio will be calculated by dividing the number of Class A common shares of Kraft held by Altria
Group, Inc. by the number of Altria Group, Inc. shares outstanding on the Record Date. Based on the number of shares of Altria Group, Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2006, the distribution ratio would be approximately 0.7 of a share of Kraft
for every share of Altria Group, Inc. common stock outstanding. Altria Group, Inc. stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Kraft. Prior to the distribution, Altria Group, Inc. will convert its Class B shares of Kraft common
stock, which carry ten votes per share, into Class A shares of Kraft, which carry one vote per share. Following the distribution, only Class A common shares of Kraft will be outstanding and Altria Group, Inc. will not own any shares of
Kraft. Altria Group, Inc. intends to adjust its current dividend so that its stockholders who retain their Altria Group, Inc. and Kraft shares will receive, in the aggregate, the same dividend dollars as before the distribution. As in the past, all
decisions regarding future dividend increases will be made independently by the Altria Group, Inc. Board of Directors and the Kraft Board of Directors, for their respective companies.

Holders of Altria Group, Inc. stock options will be treated similarly to public stockholders and will, accordingly, have their stock
awards split into two instruments. Holders of Altria Group, Inc. stock options will receive the following stock options, which, immediately after the spin-off, will have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the pre-spin
Altria Group, Inc. options:

•

a new Kraft option to acquire the number of shares of Kraft Class A common stock equal to the product of (a) the number of Altria Group, Inc. options held by such
person on the Distribution Date and (b) the approximate distribution ratio of 0.7 mentioned above; and

•

an adjusted Altria Group, Inc. option for the same number of shares of Altria Group, Inc. common stock with a reduced exercise price.

-1-


Holders of Altria Group, Inc. restricted stock or stock rights awarded prior to January 31, 2007, will retain
their existing award and will receive restricted stock or stock rights of Kraft Class A common stock. The amount of Kraft restricted stock or stock rights awarded to such holders will be calculated using the same formula set forth above with
respect to new Kraft options. All of the restricted stock and stock rights will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period (typically, three years from the date of the original grant). Recipients of Altria Group, Inc. stock
rights awarded on January 31, 2007, did not receive restricted stock or stock rights of Kraft. Rather, they will receive additional stock rights of Altria Group, Inc. to preserve the intrinsic value of the original award.

To the extent that employees of the remaining Altria Group, Inc. receive Kraft stock
options, Altria Group, Inc. will reimburse Kraft in cash for the Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options to be received. To the extent that Kraft employees hold Altria Group, Inc. stock options, Kraft will reimburse Altria Group, Inc. in cash
for the Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options. To the extent that holders of Altria Group, Inc. stock rights receive Kraft stock rights, Altria Group, Inc. will pay to Kraft the fair value of the Kraft stock rights less the value of
projected forfeitures. Based upon the number of Altria Group, Inc. stock awards outstanding at December 31, 2006, the net amount of these reimbursements would be a payment of approximately $133 million from Kraft to Altria Group, Inc. However,
this estimate is subject to change as stock awards vest (in the case of restricted stock) or are exercised (in the case of stock options) prior to the Record Date for the distribution.

Kraft is currently included in the Altria Group, Inc. consolidated federal income tax return, and federal income tax contingencies are
recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet of ALG. Prior to the distribution of Kraft shares, ALG will reimburse Kraft in cash for these liabilities, which are approximately $300 million, plus interest.

A subsidiary of ALG currently provides Kraft with certain services at cost plus a 5%
management fee. After the Distribution Date, Kraft will undertake these activities, and any remaining limited services provided to Kraft will cease in 2007. All intercompany accounts will be settled in cash within 30 days of the Distribution Date.

Altria Group, Inc. currently estimates that, if the distribution had
occurred on December 31, 2006, it would have resulted in a net decrease to Altria Group, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity of approximately $27 billion.

On or about March 20, 2007, Altria Group, Inc. will mail an Information Statement to all stockholders of Altria Group, Inc.
common stock as of the Record Date. The Information Statement will include information regarding procedures by which the distribution will be effected and other details of the transaction.

Other:

PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States. PMI is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged
primarily in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products (mainly cigarettes) internationally.

Marlboro

, the principal cigarette brand of these companies, has been the world’s largest-selling cigarette brand since 1972.

In March 2005, a subsidiary of PMI acquired 40% of the outstanding shares of PT HM
Sampoerna Tbk (“Sampoerna”), an Indonesian tobacco company. In May 2005, PMI purchased an additional 58% for a total of 98%. The total cost of the transaction was $4.8 billion, including Sampoerna’s cash of approximately $0.3 billion
and debt of the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $0.2 billion. The

-2-


purchase price was primarily financed through a euro 4.5 billion bank credit facility arranged for PMI and its subsidiaries, consisting of a euro 2.5 billion
three-year term loan facility (which, through repayments has since been reduced to euro 1.5 billion) and a euro 2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. These facilities are not guaranteed by ALG.

Sampoerna’s financial position and results of operations were fully consolidated
with PMI as of June 1, 2005. From March 2005 to May 2005, PMI recorded equity earnings in Sampoerna. During 2006 and 2005, Sampoerna reported $608 million and $315 million, respectively, of operating income and $249 million and $128 million,
respectively, of net earnings.

Kraft is engaged world-wide in the
manufacture and sale of packaged foods and beverages. Kraft manages and reports operating results through two units, Kraft North America Commercial (“KNAC”) and Kraft International Commercial (“KIC”). Kraft has operations in 72
countries and sells its products in more than 155 countries.

In June
2005, Kraft sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. The sale included the

Life Savers

,

Creme Savers

,

Altoids

,

Trolli

and

Sugus

brands. Altria
Group, Inc. has reflected the results of Kraft’s sugar confectionery business prior to the closing date as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings.

In January 2004, Kraft announced a three-year restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging Kraft’s global scale,
realigning and lowering its cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. In January 2006, Kraft announced plans to expand its restructuring efforts through 2008. The entire restructuring program is expected to result in $3.0 billion in
pre-tax charges, the closure of up to 40 facilities, the elimination of approximately 14,000 positions and annualized cost savings at the completion of the program of approximately $1.0 billion. The decline of $700 million from the $3.7 billion in
pre-tax charges previously announced was due primarily to lower than projected severance costs, the cancellation of an initiative to generate sales efficiencies, and the sale of one plant that was originally planned to be closed. Approximately $1.9
billion of the $3.0 billion in pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. Total pre-tax restructuring program charges incurred during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $673 million, $297 million and $641 million, respectively. Total pre-tax
restructuring charges for the program incurred from January 2004 through December 31, 2006 were $1.6 billion, and specific programs announced will result in the elimination of approximately 9,800 positions. Approximately 60% of the pre-tax
charges to date are expected to require cash payments.

Source of Funds
– Dividends

Because ALG is a holding company, its principal
sources of funds are from the payment of dividends and repayment of debt from its subsidiaries. In 2006, ALG received $1.4 billion in cash dividends from Kraft. Kraft and PMI each maintain separate revolving credit facilities to finance normal
working capital and other needs. The Kraft facility has a minimum net worth covenant and the PMI facilities have an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) to interest ratio covenant. Kraft and PMI have
met, and expect to continue to meet, their respective covenants. Except for the previously discussed covenants and a minimum net worth requirement at PM USA as part of a court-approved stipulation regarding the

Engle

judgment, ALG’s
principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b)  Financial Information About Segments

Altria Group, Inc.’s reportable segments are domestic tobacco, international
tobacco, North American food, international food and financial services. Net revenues and operating companies

-3-


income* (together with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years (along with total assets for each of
tobacco, food and financial services at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004) are set forth in Note 15 to Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements (“Note 15”), which is incorporated herein by reference to the
2006 Annual Report.

The relative percentages of operating companies
income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

Changes in the
relative percentages above reflect the following:

•

In 2004, domestic tobacco results reflect savings from changes that PM USA made to its trade programs. In 2005 and 2006, domestic tobacco results reflect lower wholesale
promotional allowance rates.

•

In 2005, international tobacco results primarily reflect higher pricing, the impact of acquisitions in Indonesia and Colombia, favorable currency and higher income from the
return of the

Marlboro

license in Japan. In 2006, international tobacco results primarily reflect the gain related to the exchange of PMI’s interest in a beer business in the Dominican Republic for a cigarette business, higher pricing
and the impact of acquisitions.

•

In 2004, North American and international food results reflect charges incurred as part of Kraft’s three-year restructuring program, increased promotional spending and
higher commodity and benefit costs. In 2005, North American and international food results primarily reflect higher commodity and benefit costs, partially offset by lower asset impairment and exit costs, gains on sales of international food
businesses, and the impact of the extra week of shipments. In 2006, North American and international food results primarily reflect higher asset impairment, exit and implementation costs and one less shipping week, partially offset by the gain
on redemption of Kraft’s investment in United Biscuits (“UB”) and gains on sales of North American food businesses.

•

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, financial services results include charges taken for finance lease exposure to the United States airline industry of $103 million, $200 million
and $140 million, respectively.

(c)  Narrative
Description of Business

Tobacco Products

PM USA manufactures, markets and sells cigarettes in the United States and its
territories, and contract manufactures cigarettes for PMI. Subsidiaries and affiliates of PMI and their licensees manufacture, market and sell tobacco products outside the United States.

*

Altria Group, Inc.’s management reviews operating companies income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Operating companies income for the segments excludes general
corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2 to Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the
2006 Annual Report.

Acquisitions

PMI – Holdings in the Dominican Republic:

In November 2006, a subsidiary of PMI exchanged its 47.5% interest in E. León Jimenes, C. por. A. (“ELJ”), which included a 40% indirect interest
in ELJ’s beer subsidiary, Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana, C. por. A., for 100% ownership of ELJ’s cigarette subsidiary, Industria de Tabaco León Jimenes, S.A. (“ITLJ”) and $427 million of cash, which was contributed to
ITLJ prior to the transaction. As a result of the transaction, PMI now owns 100% of the cigarette business and no longer holds an interest in ELJ’s beer business. The exchange of PMI’s interest in ELJ’s beer subsidiary resulted in a
pre-tax gain on sale of $488 million, which increased Altria Group, Inc.’s 2006 net earnings by $0.15 per diluted share. The operating results of ELJ’s cigarette subsidiary from November 2006 to December 31, 2006, the amounts of which
were not material, were included in Altria Group, Inc.’s operating results.

Sampoerna:

In March 2005, a subsidiary of PMI acquired
40% of the outstanding shares of Sampoerna, an Indonesian tobacco company. In May 2005, PMI purchased an additional 58%, for a total of 98%. The total cost of the transaction was approximately $4.8 billion, including Sampoerna’s cash of
approximately $0.3 billion and debt of the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $0.2 billion. The purchase price was primarily financed through a euro 4.5 billion bank credit facility arranged for PMI and its subsidiaries in May 2005, consisting
of a euro 2.5 billion three-year term loan facility (which, through repayments has since been reduced to euro 1.5 billion) and a euro 2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. These facilities are not guaranteed by ALG.

The acquisition of Sampoerna allowed PMI to enter the profitable kretek cigarette
category in Indonesia. Sampoerna’s financial position and results of operations have been fully consolidated with PMI as of June 1, 2005. From March 2005 to May 2005, PMI recorded equity earnings in Sampoerna. During 2006 and 2005,
Sampoerna reported $608 million and $315 million, respectively, of operating income and $249 million and $128 million, respectively, of net earnings.

During 2006, the allocation of purchase price relating to the acquisition of Sampoerna was completed. Assets purchased consist primarily of goodwill of $3.5
billion, other intangible assets (primarily brands) of $1.3 billion, inventories of $0.5 billion and property, plant and equipment of $0.4 billion. Liabilities assumed in the acquisition consist principally of long-term debt of $0.3 billion and
accrued liabilities.

Other:

During 2006, PMI entered into an agreement with British American Tobacco to purchase
the

Muratti

and

Ambassador

trademarks in certain markets, as well as rights to

L&M

and

Chesterfield

in Hong Kong, in exchange for the rights to

Benson & Hedges

in certain African markets and a payment
of $115 million. The transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2006.

On January 19, 2007, PMI entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 50.2% stake in a Pakistan cigarette manufacturer, Lakson Tobacco Company Limited (“Lakson Tobacco”), which is expected to bring PMI’s stake in
Lakson Tobacco to approximately 90%. The transaction is valued at approximately $340 million and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2007. In January 2007, PMI notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and local
stock exchanges of its intention to commence a public tender offer for the remaining shares.

During 2005, PMI acquired a 98.2% stake in Coltabaco, the largest tobacco company in Colombia, for approximately $300 million. During 2004, PMI purchased a tobacco business in Finland for a cost of

-5-


approximately $42 million. In October 2004, a subsidiary of PMI purchased a 20% stake in Lakson Tobacco in Pakistan for $60 million, bringing the
subsidiary’s aggregate share ownership of the company to 40%.

Domestic Tobacco
Products

PM USA is the largest tobacco company in the United
States, with total cigarette shipments in the United States of 183.4 billion units in 2006, a decrease of 1.1% from 2005.

PM USA’s major premium brands are

Marlboro

,

Virginia Slims

and

Parliament

. Its principal discount brand is

Basic

. All of its brands
are marketed to take into account differing preferences of adult smokers.

Marlboro

is the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States, with shipments of 150.3 billion units in 2006 (down 0.2% from 2005).

In the premium segment, PM USA’s 2006 shipment volume decreased 0.7% from 2005,
and its shipment volume in the discount segment decreased 6.2%. Shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 92.1% of PM USA’s total 2006 volume, up from 91.6% in 2005.

The following table summarizes PM USA’s retail share performance, based on data from the IRI/Capstone Total Retail Panel, which
was developed to measure market share in retail stores selling cigarettes, but was not designed to capture Internet or direct mail sales:

PM USA cannot predict future
changes or rates of change in domestic tobacco industry volume, the relative sizes of the premium and discount segments or its shipment or retail market share; however, it believes that its results may be materially adversely affected by the items
discussed in Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

As discussed in Note 19
to Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements (“Note 19”), which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2006 Annual Report, in June 2006 under the order of the Illinois Supreme Court, the cash deposits of approximately
$2.2 billion related to the

Price

case were returned to PM USA, and PM USA’s obligations to deposit further cash payments were terminated. A pre-existing 7.0%, $6 billion long-term note from ALG to PM USA that was placed in escrow
pending the outcome of plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was returned to PM USA in December 2006, following the Supreme Court’s denial of the petition. Since this note is the result of an
intercompany financing arrangement, it does not appear on the consolidated balance sheet of Altria Group, Inc.

International Tobacco Products

PMI’s
total cigarette shipments increased 3.4% in 2006 to 831.4 billion units. PMI estimates that its share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States and duty-free shipments) was
approximately 15.4%, 15.0% and 14.5% in 2006, 2005

-6-


and 2004, respectively. PMI estimates that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 5.2 trillion units in 2006, a 2.0% increase over 2005.
PMI’s leading brands —

Marlboro

,

L&M

,

Philip Morris

,

Bond Street

,

Chesterfield

,

Parliament

,

Lark

,

Merit

and

Virginia Slims

— collectively accounted for
approximately 10.9%, 11.1% and 11.0% of the international cigarette market in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Shipments of PMI’s principal brand,

Marlboro

, decreased 1.9% in 2006, and represented approximately 5.7%, 6.0%, and 5.8% of
the international cigarette market in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

PMI has a cigarette market share of at least 15%, and in a number of instances substantially more than 15%, in more than 85 markets, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.

Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

PM USA sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors),
large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services. Subsidiaries and affiliates of PMI and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors, wholesalers, retailers, state-owned enterprises and other
customers.

The market for tobacco products is highly competitive,
characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, price, marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of competition. Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances,
the distribution of incentive items, price promotions and other discounts, including coupons, product promotions and allowances for new products. The tobacco products of ALG’s subsidiaries, affiliates and their licensees are advertised and
promoted through various media, although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the United States and is prohibited or restricted in most other countries. In addition, as discussed below in Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings,

PM USA and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions.

In the United States, under a contract growing program known as the Tobacco Farmers
Partnering Program, PM USA purchases burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers. Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts.
PM USA also purchases its United States tobacco requirements through other sources. In 2003, in connection with the settlement of a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quota-holders against certain manufacturers,
including PM USA, and leaf dealers, PM USA and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant, including PM USA, to purchase a certain
percentage of its leaf requirements from U.S. tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years. These quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.

Tobacco production in the United States has been subject to government controls,
including the production control programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”). In October 2004, the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 (“FETRA”) was signed into law. FETRA provides
for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buy-out of tobacco growers and quota-holders. The cost of the buy-out to the industry is estimated at approximately $9.5 billion and is being
paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products. The cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products. The quota buy-out payments will offset already
scheduled payments to the National Tobacco Grower Settlement Trust (the “NTGST”). See Item 3.

Legal Proceedings,

Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation – National Grower

-7-


Settlement Trust for a discussion of the NTGST. Manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses (up to $500 million) that
the government may incur on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program. In 2005, PM USA recorded a $138 million expense for its share of the loss. Altria Group, Inc. does not currently
anticipate that the quota buy-out will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2007 and beyond.

In addition, oriental, flue-cured and burley tobaccos are purchased outside the United States. Tobacco production outside the United States is subject to a variety
of controls and external factors, which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs. All of those controls and programs may substantially affect market prices for tobacco.

PM USA and PMI believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to
satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.

Food Products

Acquisitions and Divestitures

United Biscuits:

In September 2006, Kraft acquired the Spanish and Portuguese operations of United Biscuits (“UB”), and rights to all Nabisco
trademarks in the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which UB has held since 2000, for a total cost of approximately $1.1 billion. The Spanish and Portuguese operations of UB include its biscuits, dry desserts, canned meats,
tomato and fruit juice businesses, as well as seven UB manufacturing facilities and 1,300 employees. From September 2006 to December 31, 2006, these businesses contributed net revenues of approximately $111 million. The non-cash acquisition was
financed by Kraft’s assumption of approximately $541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the acquisition, as well as $530 million of value for the redemption of Kraft’s outstanding investment in UB,
primarily deep-discount securities. The redemption of Kraft’s investment in UB resulted in a $251 million pre-tax gain on closing, benefiting Altria Group, Inc. by $0.06 per diluted share.

Aside from the debt assumed as part of the acquisition price, Kraft acquired assets
consisting primarily of goodwill of $734 million, other intangible assets of $217 million, property, plant and equipment of $161 million, receivables of $101 million and inventories of $34 million. These amounts represent the preliminary allocation
of purchase price and are subject to revision when appraisals are finalized, which is expected to occur during the first half of 2007.

Other:

During 2006, Kraft sold its pet snacks brand and assets, and recorded tax expense of $57 million and a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $86 million in recognition of this sale. During 2006, Kraft also sold its rice brand and
assets, and its industrial coconut assets. Additionally, during 2006, Kraft sold

-8-


certain Canadian assets and a small U.S. biscuit brand, and incurred pre-tax asset impairment charges of $176 million in 2005 in recognition of these sales. Also,
during 2006, Kraft sold a U.S. coffee plant. The aggregate proceeds received from these sales during 2006 were $946 million, on which pre-tax gains of $117 million were recorded.

In January 2007, Kraft announced the sale of its hot cereal assets and trademarks. In recognition of the anticipated sale, Kraft
recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $69 million in 2006 for these assets.

In June 2005, Kraft sold substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. The sale included the

Life Savers

,

Creme Savers

,

Altoids

,

Trolli

and

Sugus

brands. Altria Group, Inc. has reflected the results of Kraft’s sugar confectionery business prior to the closing date as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings. Kraft recorded a net loss on sale of
discontinued operations of $297 million in 2005, related largely to taxes on the transaction. ALG’s share of the loss, net of minority interest, was $255 million.

During 2005, Kraft sold its fruit snacks assets and incurred a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $93 million in recognition of this
sale. Additionally, during 2005, Kraft sold its U.K. desserts assets and its U.S. yogurt assets. The aggregate proceeds received from divestitures during 2005, other than the sugar confectionery business, were $238 million, on which pre-tax gains of
$108 million were recorded.

During 2004, Kraft sold a Brazilian snack
nuts business and trademarks associated with a candy business in Norway. The aggregate proceeds received from the sales of these businesses were $18 million, on which pre-tax losses of $3 million were recorded. During 2004, Kraft acquired
a U.S.-based beverage business for a total cost of $137 million.

The operating results of the businesses acquired and sold, other than Kraft’s UB acquisition and the divestiture of its sugar confectionery business, in the aggregate, were not material to Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the years presented.

Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

KNAC’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. In
general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other facilities. Most distribution in
North America is in the form of warehouse delivery, but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two direct-store delivery systems. Kraft supports its selling efforts through three principal sets of activities: consumer advertising in
broadcast, print, outdoor and on-line media; consumer promotions such as coupons and contests; and trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of products by customers. Subsidiaries and affiliates of KIC sell their
food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents.

Kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business. Competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and
regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates. Kraft’s food products also compete with generic products and private-label products of

-10-


food retailers, wholesalers and cooperatives. Kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing,
advertising and price. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product.

Kraft is a major purchaser of milk, cheese, nuts, green coffee beans, cocoa, corn products, wheat, pork, poultry, beef, vegetable oil,
and sugar and other sweeteners. It also uses significant quantities of glass, plastic and cardboard to package its products. Kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to
obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

Kraft purchases
a substantial portion of its dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are
substantially influenced by government programs, as well as by market supply and demand. Dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2006 than in 2005.

The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality
and availability of supply, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, the unilateral policies of the producing nations, changes in the value of the United States dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for
coffee products. In 2006, coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2005.

A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound sterling
and the United States dollar relative to certain other currencies. In 2006, cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were lower than in 2005.

During 2006, aggregate commodity costs continued to rise for Kraft, with significant impacts resulting from higher energy, packaging and coffee costs, partially
offset by lower year-over-year cheese and meat costs. For 2006, pre-tax aggregate commodity costs increased by approximately $275 million from 2005, following an increase of approximately $800 million for 2005 compared with 2004. Kraft expects the
higher cost environment to continue, particularly for energy and packaging.

The prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in Kraft’s food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of
governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, Kraft believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous
sources. Kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials. However, Kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and these strategies may not protect Kraft from increases in
specific raw material costs.

Regulation

All of KNAC’s United States food products and packaging materials are subject to
regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or, with respect to products containing meat and poultry, the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA. Among other things, these agencies enforce statutory
prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods, establish safety standards for food processing, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods, establish standards of identity for certain foods, determine the safety of
food additives, and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products.

-11-


In addition, states enforce food laws, such as regulating the business of KNAC’s operating units by licensing
plants, enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products, grading food products, inspecting plants, regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling
requirements on food products.

Many of the food commodities on which
KNAC’s United States businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies, and are subject to Congressional and administrative review.

Almost all of the activities of Kraft’s operations outside of the United States
are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to KNAC’s United States businesses and, in some cases, international regulatory provisions, such as those of the European Union (the “EU”) regarding labeling,
packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and advertising, and related areas.

The EU and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly. Other countries may adopt similar regulations. The FDA has
concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current United States law.

Business Environment

Portions of the information called
for by this Item are hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Results by Business Segment – Food
Business Environment” on pages 33 to 34 of the 2006 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Financial Services

PMCC holds investments
in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities. Total assets of PMCC were $6.8 billion at December 31, 2006, down from $7.4 billion at December 31, 2005,
reflecting a decrease in finance assets, net, due to asset sales. In 2003, PMCC shifted its strategic focus and is no longer making new investments but is instead focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize
gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities. Accordingly, PMCC’s operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold. PMCC’s finance asset portfolio includes leases in the
following investment categories: electric power, aircraft, rail and surface transport, manufacturing and real estate industries. Finance assets, net, are comprised of total lease payments receivable and the residual value of assets under lease,
reduced by third-party nonrecourse debt and unearned income. The payment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property, and is nonrecourse to all other assets of PMCC or Altria Group, Inc. As required
by accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), the third-party nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rentals receivable and has been presented on a net basis, within finance assets,
net, in Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated balance sheets.

During
2006, 2005 and 2004, PMCC received proceeds from asset sales and maturities of $357 million, $476 million and $644 million, respectively, and recorded gains of $132 million, $72 million and $112 million, respectively, in operating companies income.

Among its leasing activities, PMCC leases a number of aircraft,
predominantly to major U.S. passenger carriers. At December 31, 2006, $1.9 billion of PMCC’s finance asset balance related to aircraft. Two of PMCC’s aircraft lessees, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) and Northwest Airlines,
Inc.

-12-


(“Northwest”) are currently under bankruptcy protection. In addition, PMCC leases one natural gas-fired power plant to an indirect subsidiary of Calpine
Corporation (“Calpine”). Calpine, which has guaranteed the lease, is currently operating under bankruptcy protection. PMCC does not record income on leases in bankruptcy. Should a lease rejection or foreclosure occur, it would result in
the write-off of the finance asset balance against PMCC’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of deferred tax payments on these leases. At December 31, 2006, PMCC’s finance asset balances for these leases were as follows:

•

Delta

– PMCC’s leveraged leases with Delta for six Boeing 757, nine Boeing 767, and four McDonnell Douglas (MD-88) aircraft total $257 million. The finance
asset balance has been provided for in the allowance for losses.

•

Northwest

– PMCC has leveraged leases for three Airbus A-320 aircraft totaling $32 million. In 2006, PMCC sold ten Airbus A-319 aircraft financed under leveraged
leases, which were rejected by the lessee in 2005. Additionally, during 2006, five regional jets (“RJ85s”) previously financed as leveraged leases were foreclosed upon. Based on PMCC’s assessment of the prospect for recovery on the
A-320 aircraft, a portion of the outstanding finance asset balance has been provided for in the allowance for losses.

•

Calpine

– PMCC’s leveraged lease for one 750 megawatt (“MW”) natural gas-fired power plant (located in Pasadena, Texas) was $60 million. The lessee
(an affiliate of Calpine) was not included as part of the bankruptcy filing of Calpine. In addition, leases of two 265 MW natural gas-fired power plants (located in Tiverton, Rhode Island, and Rumford, Maine), which were part of the bankruptcy
filing, were rejected during the first quarter of 2006. It is anticipated that at some point during the Calpine bankruptcy proceedings, PMCC’s interest in these plants will be foreclosed upon by the lenders under the leveraged leases. Based on
PMCC’s assessment of the prospect for recovery on the Pasadena plant, a portion of the outstanding finance asset balance has been provided for in the allowance for losses.

At December 31, 2006, PMCC’s allowance for losses was $480 million. During
the second quarter of 2006, PMCC increased its allowance for losses by $103 million due to continuing issues within the airline industry. Charge-offs to the allowance for losses in 2006 totaled $219 million. The acceleration of taxes on the
foreclosures of Northwest RJ85s and six aircraft previously financed under leveraged leases with United Air Lines, Inc. (“United”) written off in the first quarter of 2006 upon United’s emergence from bankruptcy, totaled approximately
$80 million. Foreclosures on Delta and Calpine (Tiverton & Rumford) leveraged leases will result in the acceleration of previously deferred taxes of approximately $180 million.

In the third quarter 2005, PMCC recorded a provision for losses of $200 million due to continuing uncertainty within its airline
portfolio and bankruptcy filings by Delta and Northwest. As a result of this provision, PMCC’s fixed charges coverage ratio did not meet its 1.25:1 requirement under a support agreement with ALG. Accordingly, as required by the support
agreement, a support payment of $150 million was made by ALG to PMCC in September 2005. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, PMCC recorded a provision for losses of $140 million for its airline industry exposure. During 2006, 2005 and 2004,
charge-offs to the allowance for losses were $219 million, $101 million and $39 million, respectively. It is possible that additional adverse developments may require PMCC to increase its allowance for losses.

The IRS concluded its examination of ALG’s consolidated tax returns for the years
1996 through 1999, and issued a final Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on March 15, 2006. The RAR disallowed benefits pertaining to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999. Altria Group, Inc. has
agreed with all conclusions of the RAR, with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999.

-13-


PMCC will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately $150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid
with regard to them. The IRS may in the future challenge and disallow more of PMCC’s leveraged leases based on recent Revenue Rulings, a recent IRS Notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases (lease-in/lease-out
(“LILO”) and sale-in/lease-out (“SILO”) transactions). PMCC believes that the position and supporting case law described in the RAR, Revenue Rulings and the IRS Notice are incorrectly applied to PMCC’s transactions and that
its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the IRS’s position. PMCC and ALG intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation. In this regard, on
October 16, 2006, PMCC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest and intends to file complaints for the remainder. However,
should PMCC’s position not be upheld, PMCC may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases, which
could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of Altria Group, Inc. in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. PMCC considered this matter in its adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”) and FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction.”

Business Environment

Portions of the information called
for by this Item are hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Results by Business Segment –
Financial Services” on pages 36 to 37 of the 2006 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Other Matters

Customers

None of the business segments of the Altria family of companies is
dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated results of operations. However, Kraft’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 40%,
37% and 38% of its net revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. One of Kraft’s customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for approximately 15%, 14% and 14% of Kraft’s net revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, ALG and its subsidiaries employed approximately 175,000 people worldwide. In January 2004, Kraft announced
a three-year restructuring program and in January 2006, it announced plans to expand its restructuring efforts through 2008. The entire restructuring program is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 14,000 positions. At
December 31, 2006, approximately 8,400 of these positions have been eliminated.

Research and Development

The research and development
expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in Note 17 to Altria Group, Inc.’s financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2006 Annual Report.

-14-


Trademarks

Trademarks are of material importance to ALG’s consumer products subsidiaries and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States and most
other markets where the related products are sold.

Environmental Regulation

ALG and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state,
local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States; the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party. In 2006, subsidiaries (or former
subsidiaries) of ALG were involved in approximately 75 active matters subjecting them to potential remediation costs under Superfund or other laws and regulations. ALG’s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in
connection with environmental laws and regulations. Although it is not possible to predict precise levels of environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs and the making
of such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.

(d)  Financial Information About Geographic Areas

The amounts of net revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of Altria
Group, Inc.’s geographic segments and the amount of export sales from the United States for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in Note 15.

Subsidiaries of ALG export tobacco and tobacco-related products, coffee products, grocery products, cheese and processed meats. In
2006, net revenues from all exports from the United States by these subsidiaries amounted to approximately $4 billion.

(e)  Available Information

ALG is required to file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Investors may read and copy any document that
ALG files, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Investors may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, from which investors can
electronically access ALG’s SEC filings.

ALG makes available free
of charge on or through its website (www.altria.com), its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after ALG electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. Investors can access ALG’s filings with the SEC by visiting
www.altria.com/secfilings.

The information on ALG’s website is not,
and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this report or incorporated into any other filings ALG makes with the SEC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following
risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating
results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.

We* may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in
press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “strategy,” “expects,” “continues,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,”
“will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “projects,” “goals,” “targets” and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement
will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or
should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain
invested in Altria Group, Inc.’s securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could
cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we
face throughout this document, particularly in the “Business Environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all
risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time.

Tobacco-Related Litigation

.  There is substantial litigation related
to tobacco products in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the
commencement of additional litigation. Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been
appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 40 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.

It is possible that Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated results of operations, cash
flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, management
believes the litigation environment has substantially improved. ALG and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has a number of valid defenses to the
litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, ALG and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular
cases if they believe it is in the best interests of ALG’s stockholders to do so. Please see Note 19 for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.

*

This section uses the terms “we,” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among ALG and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction
is clear from the context.

-16-


Corporate Restructuring

.  On January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors of ALG authorized the
distribution of all Kraft shares owned by ALG to ALG’s shareholders. The distribution will be made on March 30, 2007 to ALG shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2007. It is possible that an action may be brought
seeking to enjoin the spin-off. Any such injunction would have to be based on a finding that Altria is insolvent or would be insolvent after giving effect to the spin-off or intends to delay, hinder or defraud creditors. In the event the spin-off is
challenged, ALG will defend such action vigorously, including by prosecuting any necessary appeals. Although litigation is subject to uncertainty, management believes that Altria should ultimately prevail against any such action.

Tobacco Control Action in the Public and Private Sectors

.  Our tobacco
subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Governmental
actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume, and we expect this decline to continue.

Excise Taxes

.  Cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in
the United States and to substantial taxation abroad. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes and fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the United States, the EU and in other foreign
jurisdictions. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, PMI’s products are subject to discriminatory tax structures, and inconsistent rulings and interpretations on complex methodologies to determine excise and other tax burdens.

Tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an
adverse impact on sales of cigarettes by our tobacco subsidiaries, due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or
to counterfeit or contraband products.

Minimum Retail Selling Price
Laws

.  Several EU Member States have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and, in some cases, other tobacco products. The European Commission has commenced proceedings against these Member States,
claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe EU law. If the European Commission’s infringement actions are successful, they could adversely impact excise tax levels and/or price gaps in those markets.

Increased Competition in the Domestic Tobacco Market

.  Settlements of
certain tobacco litigation in the United States have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases. PM USA faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain domestic and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are
not parties to these settlements. These manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not
required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states. Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale
of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands.

Counterfeit Cigarettes in International Markets

.  Large quantities of
counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. PMI believes that

Marlboro

is the most heavily counterfeited international brand. PMI cannot quantify the amount of revenue it loses as a result of this activity.

Governmental Investigations

.  From time to time, ALG and its tobacco
subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. Ongoing investigations include allegations of

contraband shipments of cigarettes and allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets. We cannot predict the outcome of those
investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations.

New Tobacco Product Technologies

.  Our tobacco subsidiaries continue
to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that have the objective of reducing constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet
their taste expectations. We cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts. If they do not succeed, but one or more of their competitors do, our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage.

PM USA
and PMI have adjacency growth strategies involving potential moves into complementary tobacco or tobacco-related products or processes. We cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies, will be
successful.

Foreign Currency

.  Our international food
and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, their results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a
strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.

Competition and Economic Downturns

.  Each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition, changes in consumer preferences
and local economic conditions. To be successful, they must continue to:

•

promote brand equity successfully;

•

anticipate and respond to new consumer trends;

•

develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products;

•

improve productivity; and

•

respond effectively to changing prices for their raw materials.

The willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of
economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands, and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly.

Our finance subsidiary, PMCC, holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power
generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities. Its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions. If counterparties to PMCC’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions, PMCC
may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our profitability.

Grocery Trade Consolidation

.  As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated, they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further,
these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products. If Kraft fails to use its scale, marketing expertise, branded products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends, its volume
growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products, any of which would adversely affect our profitability.

-18-


Continued Need to Add Food and Beverage Products in Faster Growing and More Profitable
Categories

.  The food and beverage industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Kraft’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that
it serves. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories. If Kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements, its volume growth may slow, which would
adversely affect our profitability.

Strengthening Brand Portfolios
Through Acquisitions and Divestitures

.  One element of the growth strategy of our consumer product subsidiaries is to strengthen their brand portfolios and/or expand their geographic reach through active programs of selective
acquisitions and divestitures. These subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition candidates and from time to time they may sell businesses that are outside their core categories or that do not meet their growth or profitability
targets. Acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings.

Food Raw Material Prices

.  The raw materials used by our food businesses are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by
external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs (which are significantly
affected by oil costs), and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, net revenues and operating companies income. We do not fully hedge against changes in
commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not work as planned.

Food Safety, Quality and Health Concerns

.  We could be adversely affected if consumers in Kraft’s principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. Adverse publicity about these
types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying Kraft’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Recent publicity concerning the health implications of obesity and trans- fatty acids could also reduce
consumption of certain of Kraft’s products. In addition, Kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded. Kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury. A widespread
product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in Kraft’s food products and could have a material adverse effect on Kraft’s business
and results.

Asset Impairment

.  We periodically
calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. If impairment is determined to
exist, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.

IRS Challenges to PMCC Leases.

The IRS concluded its examination of ALG’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999, and issued a final Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on March 15,
2006. The RAR disallowed benefits pertaining to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999. Altria Group, Inc. has agreed with all conclusions of the RAR, with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining
to several PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999. PMCC will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately $150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid
with regard to them. The IRS may in the future challenge and disallow more of PMCC’s leveraged leases based on recent Revenue Rulings, a recent IRS Notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases (lease-in/lease-out
(“LILO”) and sale-in/lease-out

-19-


(“SILO”) transactions). PMCC believes that the position and supporting case law described in the RAR, Revenue Rulings and the IRS Notice are incorrectly
applied to PMCC’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the IRS’s position. PMCC and ALG intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position
through litigation. In this regard, on October 16, 2006, PMCC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest and intends to file
complaints for the remainder. However, should PMCC’s position not be upheld, PMCC may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income
from the affected leveraged leases, which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of Altria Group, Inc. in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. PMCC considered this matter in its adoption of FIN 48 and FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 13-2.

Tobacco Products

PM USA owns and operates six tobacco manufacturing and processing
facilities – five in the Richmond, Virginia area and one in Cabarrus County, North Carolina. In April 2005, PM USA announced the construction of a research and technology center in Richmond, Virginia, which is estimated to cost $350
million. When completed in 2007, the facility will nearly double PM USA’s research space and will house more than 500 scientists, engineers and support staff.

Subsidiaries and affiliates of PMI own, lease or have an interest in 71 cigarette or component manufacturing facilities in 34
countries outside the United States, including cigarette manufacturing facilities in Bergen Op Zoom, the Netherlands; Berlin, Germany; and St. Petersburg, Russia. In 2006, PMI continued to invest in and expand its international manufacturing base,
including making significant investments in facilities located in Germany, Russia, Greece, Serbia, Ukraine and Australia, as well as a research facility in Switzerland.

Food Products

Kraft has 159 manufacturing and processing facilities, 54 of which are located in the United States. Kraft owns 154 and leases 5 of these facilities. Outside the
United States, Kraft has 105 manufacturing and processing facilities located in 42 countries. In addition, Kraft has 327 distribution centers and depots, of which 31 are located outside the United States. Kraft owns 47 distribution centers and
depots, with the remainder being leased.

In January 2004, Kraft
announced a three-year restructuring program and in January 2006, it announced plans to expand its restructuring efforts through 2008. The entire restructuring program is expected to result in the closure of up to 40 facilities. In 2006, Kraft
announced the closing of 8 plants, for a total of 27 since the commencement of the restructuring program in January 2004.

General

The plants and properties owned and operated by ALG’s subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against ALG, its subsidiaries and affiliates, including PM USA and PMI, as well as their respective indemnitees. Various types
of claims are raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors.

Overview of Tobacco-Related Litigation

Types and Number of Cases

Claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal
injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs, (ii) smoking and health cases primarily alleging personal injury or seeking court-supervised programs for ongoing medical monitoring and purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of
individual plaintiffs, including cases in which the aggregated claims of a number of individual plaintiffs are to be tried in a single proceeding, (iii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) and
non-governmental plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits, (iv) class action suits alleging that the uses of the terms “Lights” and “Ultra
Lights” constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law fraud, or violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), and (v) other tobacco-related litigation described below. Damages
claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation range into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs’ theories of recovery and the defenses raised in pending smoking and health, health care cost recovery and Lights/Ultra Lights cases are discussed
below.

The table below lists the number of certain tobacco-related cases
pending in the United States against PM USA and, in some instances, ALG or PMI, as of February 15, 2007, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and a page-reference to further discussions of each type of case.

(1)

Does not include 2,624 cases brought by flight attendants seeking compensatory damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”). The
flight attendants allege that they are members of an ETS smoking and health class action, which was settled in 1997. The terms of the court-approved settlement in that case allow class members to file individual lawsuits seeking compensatory
damages, but prohibit them from seeking punitive damages. Also, does not include nine individual smoking and health cases brought against certain retailers that are indemnitees of PM USA.

-21-


(2)

Includes as one case the aggregated claims of 928 individuals (of which 583 individuals have claims against PM USA) that are proposed to be tried in a single proceeding in West Virginia. The
West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has ruled that the United States Constitution does not preclude a trial in two phases in this case. Issues related to defendants’ conduct, plaintiffs’ entitlement to punitive damages and a punitive
damages multiplier, if any, would be determined in the first phase. The second phase would consist of individual trials to determine liability, if any, and compensatory damages.

There are also a number of other tobacco-related actions pending outside the United
States against PMI and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including an estimated 130 individual smoking and health cases as of February 15, 2007 (Argentina (56), Australia (2), Brazil (56), Chile (6), Costa Rica (1), France (1), Italy (5), the
Philippines (1), Poland (1) and Scotland (1), compared with approximately 132 such cases on December 31, 2005, and approximately 121 such cases on December 31, 2004. In addition, in Italy, 17 cases are pending in the Italian
equivalent of small claims court where damages are limited to

€

2,000 per case, and three cases are pending in Finland and one
in Israel against defendants that are indemnitees of a subsidiary of PMI.

In addition, as of February 15, 2007, there were two smoking and health putative class actions pending outside the United States against PMI in Brazil (1) and Israel (1) compared with three such cases on December 31,
2005, and three such cases on December 31, 2004. Three health care cost recovery actions are pending in Israel (1), Canada (1) and France (1), against PMI or its affiliates, and two Lights/Ultra Lights class actions are pending in Israel.

Pending
and Upcoming Trials

As of December 31, 2006, six individual
smoking and health cases against PM USA are scheduled for trial in 2007. Trial in an individual smoking and health case in California (

Whiteley

) began on January 22, 2007. Cases against other tobacco companies are also scheduled for
trial through the end of 2007. Trial dates are subject to change.

Recent Trial
Results

Since January 1999, verdicts have been returned in 45
smoking and health, Lights/Ultra Lights and health care cost recovery cases in which PM USA was a defendant. Verdicts in favor of PM USA and other defendants were returned in 28 of the 45 cases. These 28 cases were tried in California (4), Florida
(9), Mississippi (1), Missouri (2), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1), New York (3), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), Rhode Island (1), Tennessee (2), and West Virginia (1). Plaintiffs’ appeals or post-trial motions challenging the verdicts are
pending in California, the District of Columbia, Florida and Missouri. A motion for a new trial has been granted in one of the cases in Florida. In addition, in December 2002, a court dismissed an individual smoking and health case in California at
the end of trial.

In July 2005, a jury in Tennessee returned a verdict
in favor of PM USA in a case in which plaintiffs had challenged PM USA’s retail promotional and merchandising programs under the Robinson-Patman Act.

Of the 17 cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs, eight have reached final resolution. A verdict against defendants in a health care cost
recovery case has been reversed and all claims were dismissed with prejudice. In addition, a verdict against defendants in a purported Lights class action in Illinois has been reversed and the case has been dismissed with prejudice. After exhausting
all appeals, PM USA has paid six judgments totaling $71,476,238, and interest totaling $33,799,281.

Bullock

: In August 2006, the California Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition to overturn the trial court’s reduction of the punitive damage award and granted PM
USA’s petition for review challenging the punitive damage award. The court granted review of the case on a “grant and hold” basis under which further action by the court is deferred pending the United States Supreme Court’s
decision on punitive damages in the

Williams

case described below.

(2)

Williams

: The trial court reduced the punitive damages award to $32 million, and PM USA and plaintiff appealed. In June 2002, the Oregon Court of Appeals
reinstated the $79.5 million punitive

-27-


damages award. Following the Oregon Supreme Court’s refusal to hear PM USA’s appeal, PM USA recorded a provision of $32 million in connection with this case
and petitioned the United States Supreme Court for further review. In October 2003, the United States Supreme Court set aside the Oregon appellate court’s ruling, and directed the Oregon court to reconsider the case in light of the 2003

State Farm

decision by the United States Supreme Court, which limited punitive damages. In June 2004, the Oregon Court of Appeals reinstated the $79.5 million punitive damages award. In February 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed
the Court of Appeals’ decision. Following this decision, PM USA recorded an additional provision of approximately $20 million in interest charges related to this case. The United States Supreme Court granted PM USA’s petition for writ of
certiorari in May 2006. On February 20, 2007, the United States Supreme Court vacated the $79.5 million punitive damages award in holding that the United States Constitution prohibits basing punitive damages awards on harm to
non-parties. The Court also found that states must assure that appropriate procedures are in place so that juries are provided with proper legal guidance as to the constitutional limitations on awards of punitive damages. Accordingly, the Court
remanded the case to the Oregon Supreme Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

In addition to the cases discussed above, in October 2003, a three-judge appellate panel in Brazil reversed a lower court’s dismissal of an individual smoking
and health case and ordered PMI’s Brazilian affiliate to pay plaintiff approximately $256,000 and other unspecified damages. PMI’s Brazilian affiliate appealed. In December 2004, the three-judge panel’s decision was vacated by an

en banc

panel of the appellate court, which upheld the trial court’s dismissal of the case. The case is currently on appeal to the Superior Court.

With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, excluding amounts relating to the

Engle

case, as of December 31, 2006, PM USA has posted
various forms of security totaling approximately $194 million, the majority of which have been collateralized with cash deposits, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals. The cash deposits are included in other assets on the consolidated
balance sheets.

Engle Class Action

In July 2000, in the second phase of the

Engle

smoking and health class action
in Florida, a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately $145 billion against various defendants, including $74 billion against PM USA. Following entry of judgment, PM USA posted a bond in the amount of $100 million
and appealed.

In May 2001, the trial court approved a stipulation
providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the

Engle

judgment will remain stayed against PM USA and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review. As a result of the stipulation, PM USA
placed $500 million into a separate interest-bearing escrow account that, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with Florida Rules of Civil
Procedure. In July 2001, PM USA also placed $1.2 billion into an interest-bearing escrow account, which will be returned to PM USA should it prevail in its appeal of the case. (The $1.2 billion escrow account is included in the December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheets as other assets. Interest income on the $1.2 billion escrow account is paid to PM USA quarterly and is being recorded as earned, in interest and other debt expense, net, in the consolidated
statements of earnings.) In connection with the stipulation, PM USA recorded a $500 million pre-tax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. In May 2003, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal
reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class. Plaintiffs petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for further review.

-28-


In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated, that the class approved
by the trial court be decertified, and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate. The court further declared the following Phase I findings are entitled to res
judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate: (i) that smoking causes various diseases; (ii) that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) that defendants’ cigarettes were
defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health
effects or addictive nature of smoking; (v) that all defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their
detriment; (vi) that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment; (vii) that all
defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (viii) that all defendants were negligent. The court also reinstated compensatory damage awards totaling approximately $6.9 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a
third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations. It is too early to predict how many members of the decertified class will file individual claims in the prescribed time period.

In August 2006, PM USA sought rehearing from the Florida Supreme Court on parts of its
July 2006 opinion, including the ruling (described above) that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by

Engle

class members. The rehearing motion also asked, among other things, that
legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the Third District Court of Appeal or in the Florida Supreme Court now be addressed. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in August 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability
of the statute of limitations to non-members of the decertified class. In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court refused to revise its July 2006 ruling, except that it revised the set of Phase I findings entitled to res judicata effect by
excluding finding (v) listed above (relating to agreement to misrepresent information), and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to the representations of fact made
by defendants. On January 11, 2007, the Florida Supreme Court issued the mandate from its revised opinion. On January 12, 2007, defendants filed a motion with the Florida Third District Court of Appeal requesting that the court address
legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the Third District or by the Florida Supreme Court. On February 21, 2007, the Third District Court of Appeal denied defendants’ motion.
Defendants intend to seek further appellate review.

Scott Class Action

In July 2003, following the first phase of the trial in the

Scott

class action, in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs, a Louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, including PM USA, in connection with plaintiffs’
medical monitoring claims, but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance. The jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and
diseases and marketed their products to minors. In May 2004, in the second phase of the trial, the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $590 million against all defendants jointly and severally, to fund a 10-year smoking cessation program.

In June 2004, the court entered judgment, which awarded plaintiffs the
approximately $590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced. As of February 15, 2007, the amount of prejudgment interest was approximately $444 million. PM USA’s share of the jury award and
prejudgment interest has not been allocated. Defendants, including PM USA appealed. Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at $50 million for all defendants in accordance with an
article of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure,

-29-


and a Louisiana statute (the “bond cap law”) fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the MSA (as defined below). Under the
terms of the stipulation, plaintiffs reserve the right to contest, at a later date, the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law. In September 2004, defendants collectively
posted a bond in the amount of $50 million.

In February 2007, the
Louisiana Court of Appeal issued a ruling on defendants’ appeal that, among other things: affirmed class certification but limited the scope of the class; struck certain of the categories of damages that comprised the judgment, reducing the
amount of the award by approximately $312 million; vacated the award of prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately $444 million as of February 15, 2007; and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking
cessation program are those who began smoking before, and whose claims accrued by, September 1, 1988. As a result, the Louisiana Court of Appeal remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion, including further reduction of the amount of
the award based on the size of the new class. Defendants intend to seek further appellate review.

Smoking and Health Litigation

Overview

Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in
smoking and health cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, nuisance, breach of express and implied warranties, breach of
special duty, conspiracy, concert of action, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes, and claims under the federal and state anti-racketeering statutes. Plaintiffs in the smoking and health actions seek various
forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble/multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and equitable
relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, statutes of limitations and preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.

Smoking and Health Class Actions

Since the dismissal in May 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on
behalf of allegedly addicted smokers, plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts. In general, these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or
states (although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope) and raise addiction claims and, in many cases, claims of physical injury as well.

Class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in 57 smoking and health class actions involving PM USA in Arkansas (1), the District of Columbia (2),
Florida (2), Illinois (2), Iowa (1), Kansas (1), Louisiana (1), Maryland (1), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Nevada (29), New Jersey (6), New York (2), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (1), Puerto Rico (1), South Carolina (1), Texas (1) and
Wisconsin (1). A class remains certified in the

Scott

class action discussed above.

A smoking and health class action is pending in Brazil. Plaintiff is a consumer organization, the Smoker
Health Defense Association (

ADESF

), which filed a claim against Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A. (now Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Commercio Ltda.) at the 19

th

Civil Court of São Paulo. Trial and appellate courts found that the action could proceed as a class under the Brazilian Consumer Defense Code. Philip Morris
Brasil Industria e Commercio Ltda. appealed this

-30-


decision and this appeal is pending before the Supreme Federal Court in Brazil. In addition, in February 2004, the trial court awarded the equivalent of approximately
R$1,000 (with the current exchange rate, approximately U.S. $450) per smoker per full year of smoking for moral damages plus interest at the rate of 1% per month, as of the date of the ruling. The court order contemplates a second stage of the
case in which individuals are to file their claims. Material damages, if any, will be assessed in this second phase. Defendants have appealed this decision to the São Paulo Court of Appeals, and execution of the judgment has been stayed until
the appeal is resolved.

In January 2006, plaintiffs brought a putative
class action

(Caronia)

in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of New York residents who: are age 50 or older; have smoked the

Marlboro

brand for 20 pack-years or more; and have neither been
diagnosed with lung cancer nor are under examination by a physician for suspected lung cancer. Plaintiffs seek the creation of a court-supervised program providing members of the purported class Low Dose CT Scanning in order to identify and diagnose
lung cancer.

Espinosa Class Action

In December 2006, plaintiffs brought this putative class action against PM USA and
other defendants in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois on behalf of individuals from throughout Illinois and/or the United States who purchased cigarettes manufactured by certain defendants from 1996 through the date of any judgment in
plaintiffs’ favor. Excluded from the purported class are any individuals who allege personal injury or health care costs. The complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants were negligent and violated the Illinois consumer fraud statute
by certain defendants’ steadily and purposefully increasing the nicotine level and absorption of their cigarettes into the human body, including in brands most popular with young people and minorities. On January 12, 2007, PM USA removed
the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation

Overview

In health care cost recovery litigation, domestic and foreign
governmental entities and non-governmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and, in some cases, of future expenditures and damages as well. Relief sought by some but not all
plaintiffs includes punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs,
additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees.

The claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking, as well as claims of indemnity,
negligence, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranty, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer
fraud, antitrust, deceptive trade practices and false advertising, and claims under federal and state anti-racketeering statutes.

Defenses raised include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a valid claim, lack of benefit, adequate remedy at law, “unclean
hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), lack of antitrust

-31-


standing and injury, federal preemption, lack of statutory authority to bring suit, and statutes of limitations. In addition, defendants argue that they should be
entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise. Defendants also argue that these cases are improper because
plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment. Under traditional theories of recovery, a payor of medical costs (such as an insurer) can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the
shoes” of the injured party. Defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party.

Although there have been some decisions to the contrary, most judicial decisions have
dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers. Nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts, relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote, have ordered or
affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions. The United States Supreme Court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals.

In March 1999, in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial, an Ohio jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts. In addition, a $17.8 million verdict against defendants (including $6.8 million against PM USA) was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in New York, and all claims were dismissed with
prejudice in February 2005 (

Blue Cross/Blue Shield

). The health care cost recovery case brought by the City of St. Louis, Missouri and approximately 50 Missouri hospitals, in which PM USA and ALG are defendants, remains pending without a
trial date.

Individuals and associations have also sued in purported
class actions or as private attorneys general under the Medicare As Secondary Payer statute to recover from defendants Medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smoking-related diseases. Cases brought in New York (

Mason

),
Florida (

Glover

) and Massachusetts (

United Seniors Association

) have been dismissed by federal courts, and plaintiffs’ appeal in

United Seniors Association

is pending.

A number of foreign governmental entities have filed health care cost recovery actions
in the United States. Such suits have been brought in the United States by 13 countries, a Canadian province, 11 Brazilian states and 11 Brazilian cities. All of these 36 cases have been dismissed. On February 23, 2007, the Delaware Supreme Court
affirmed the dismissal of the two remaining cases on appeal (brought by the Republic of Panama and the Brazilian State of São Paulo). In addition to the cases brought in the United States, health care cost recovery actions have also been
brought against tobacco industry participants, including PM USA, PMI and certain PMI subsidiaries in Israel (1), the Marshall Islands (1 dismissed), Canada (1), and France (1 dismissed, but subject to possible further appeal), and other entities
have stated that they are considering filing such actions. In September 2005, in the case in Canada, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that legislation passed in British Columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional, and, as a result, the case
which had previously been dismissed by the trial court was permitted to proceed. PM USA and other defendants’ challenge to the British Columbian court’s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the Court of Appeals of British Columbia and
defendants have sought leave to appeal the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada. Several other provinces in Canada have enacted similar legislation.

Settlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation

In November 1998, PM USA and certain other United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) with 46
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other United States
tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by

-32-


Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the “State Settlement Agreements”). The State Settlement Agreements require that the
domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts (excluding future annual payments under the National Tobacco Grower Settlement Trust discussed below), subject to adjustments for several factors, including
inflation, market share and industry volume: 2007, $8.4 billion and thereafter, $9.4 billion each year. In addition, the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an annual cap of $500
million.

The State Settlement Agreements also include provisions
relating to advertising and marketing restrictions, public disclosure of certain industry documents, limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws, restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions.

Possible Adjustments in MSA Payments for 2003 and 2004

Pursuant to the provisions of the MSA, domestic tobacco product manufacturers,
including PM USA, who are original signatories to the MSA (“OPMs”), are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the OPMs and the other MSA-participating manufacturers to the states and
territories that are parties to the MSA for the years 2003 and 2004. The proceedings are based on the collective loss of market share in each of 2003 and 2004 by all manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions
of the MSA to non-participating manufacturers (“NPMs”) who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions.

In these proceedings, an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the MSA parties is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the MSA were
a “significant factor” contributing to the collective loss of market share for the year in question. If the firm determines that the disadvantages of the MSA were such a “significant factor,” each state may avoid a downward
adjustment to its share of the OPMs’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year. Any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to those
states that do not establish such diligent enforcement. PM USA believes that the MSA’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of
three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the MSA. A number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a state-by-state basis.

In March of 2006, an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor
contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003. On February 12, 2007, this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the
participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004. Following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003, thirty-eight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a
declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003. The OPMs and other MSA-participating manufacturers have responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the MSA,
including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven MSA states and territories that have not filed declaratory judgment actions.

The issue of what forum will determine the states’ diligent enforcement claims, and the availability and the precise amount of any NPM Adjustment for either
2003 or 2004 will not be finally determined until late 2007 or thereafter. There is no certainty that the OPMs and other MSA-participating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings. If the OPMs do receive
such an adjustment, the adjustment would likely be applied as a credit against future MSA payments and would be allocated among the OPMs pursuant to the MSA’s provisions for allocation of the NPM Adjustment among the OPMs.

National Grower Settlement Trust

As part of the MSA, the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobacco-growing states to address concerns about the potential adverse
economic impact of the MSA on tobacco growers and quota holders. To that end, in 1999, four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers, including PM USA, established the National Tobacco Grower Settlement Trust (“NTGST”), a trust
fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders. The trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments, prior to application of various adjustments, scheduled to total $5.15 billion. Provisions of the NTGST
allowed for offsets to the extent that industry-funded payments were made for the benefit of growers or quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program.

In October 2004, the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 (“FETRA”)
was signed into law. FETRA provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry-funded buy-out of tobacco growers and quota holders. The cost of the buy-out, which is estimated at approximately $9.5
billion, is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product. The cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product. The quota buy-out
payments offset already scheduled payments to the NTGST. FETRA also obligated manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to cover any losses (up to $500 million) that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated
under the previous tobacco price support program. PM USA has paid $138 million for its share of the tobacco pool stock losses. ALG does not currently anticipate that the quota buy-out will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results
in 2007 and beyond.

Other MSA-Related Litigation

In April 2004, a lawsuit was filed in state court in Los Angeles, California, on
behalf of all California residents who purchased cigarettes in California from April 2000 to the present, alleging that the MSA enabled the defendants, including PM USA and ALG, to engage in unlawful price fixing and market sharing agreements. The
complaint sought damages and also sought to enjoin defendants from continuing to operate under those provisions of the MSA that allegedly violate California law. In June 2004, plaintiffs dismissed this case and refiled a substantially similar
complaint in federal court in San Francisco, California. The new complaint is brought on behalf of the same purported class but differs in that it covers purchases from June 2000 to the present, names the Attorney General of California as a
defendant, and does not name ALG as a defendant. In March 2005, the trial court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs have appealed.

Several actions are currently pending challenging the legality of various provisions of the MSA under various theories. Neither ALG nor PM USA is a party in
these actions. There is a suit pending against New York state officials, in which importers of cigarettes allege that the MSA and certain New York statutes enacted in connection with the MSA violate federal antitrust and constitutional law. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief on antitrust grounds. In September 2004, the trial court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the MSA and certain related
New York statutes on the grounds that the plaintiffs were unlikely to prove their allegations, but the court issued a preliminary injunction against an amendment repealing the “allocable share” provision of the New York Escrow Statute
pending further discovery. The parties’ motions for summary judgment are pending. Additionally, in a separate proceeding pending in New York federal court, plaintiffs seek to enjoin the statutes enacted by New York and 30 other states in
connection with the MSA on the grounds that the statutes violate the federal antitrust laws and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In September 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs
have stated a claim for relief and that the New York

-34-


federal court had jurisdiction over the 30 defendant Attorneys General from states other than New York and, in October 2006, the United States Supreme Court denied the
Attorneys Generals’ petition for writ of certiorari. In May 2006, the district court denied plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction against enforcement of the Escrow Statute’s “complementary legislation” based on an inability
to prove the facts alleged. Plaintiffs have appealed. In March 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a Louisiana trial court’s dismissal of federal constitutional challenges to certain provisions of the MSA. As
a result, the case will proceed to trial in federal court beginning in June 2007. Similar lawsuits are pending in other states on similar antitrust, Commerce Clause and/or other constitutional theories, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A similar proceeding has been brought under the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the United Nations. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently affirmed the dismissal of an
action in Kentucky. Plaintiff in that case has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for rehearing en banc. In addition, appeals of cases raising similar constitutional and antitrust challenges to the MSA are currently
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second, Sixth and Tenth Circuits.

Federal Government’s Lawsuit

In 1999, the United
States government filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against various cigarette manufacturers, including PM USA, and others, including ALG, asserting claims under three federal statutes, the Medical Care
Recovery Act (“MCRA”), the Medicare Secondary Payer (“MSP”) provisions of the Social Security Act and the civil provisions of RICO. Trial of the case ended in June 2005. The lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of
health care costs for tobacco-related illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs, including Medicare, military and veterans’ health
benefits programs, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The complaint alleged that such costs total more than $20 billion annually. It also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief, including disgorgement of
profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct, an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants, and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health
care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct. In September 2000, the trial court dismissed the government’s MCRA and MSP claims, but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief
under the civil provisions of RICO.

The government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately $280 billion is an appropriate remedy. In May 2004, the trial court issued an order denying
defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy. In February 2005, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the
government under the civil provisions of RICO and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim. In April 2005, the Court of Appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing. In July 2005, the
government petitioned the United States Supreme Court for further review of the Court of Appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy, and in October 2005, the Supreme Court denied the petition.

In June 2005, the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment
seeking remedies of approximately $14 billion, including $10 billion over a five-year period to fund a national smoking cessation program and $4 billion over a ten-year period to fund a public education and counter-marketing campaign. Further, the
government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable. The government’s
proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business

-35-


operations – including, but not limited to, restrictions on advertising and marketing, potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and
research and development, disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations.

In August 2006, the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government. The court held that certain defendants, including
ALG and PM USA, violated RICO and engaged in 7 of the 8 “sub-schemes” to defraud that the government had alleged. Specifically, the court found that:

•

defendants falsely denied, distorted and minimized the significant adverse health consequences of smoking;

•

defendants hid from the public that cigarette smoking and nicotine are addictive;

•

defendants falsely denied that they control the level of nicotine delivered to create and sustain addiction;

•

defendants falsely marketed and promoted “low tar/light” cigarettes as less harmful than full-flavor cigarettes;

•

defendants falsely denied that they intentionally marketed to youth;

•

defendants publicly and falsely denied that ETS is hazardous to non-smokers; and

•

defendants suppressed scientific research.

The court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants, but ordered the following relief: (i) an injunction against “committing any act of
racketeering” relating to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States; (ii) an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the Council
for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute, or the Center for Indoor Air Research, or any successor or affiliated entities of each; (iii) an injunction against “making, or causing to be made in any way, any material false, misleading, or
deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the United States public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes”; (iv) an injunction
against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material, including “lights,” “ultra lights” and “low tar,” which the
court found could cause consumers to believe a cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand; (v) the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of
smoking and nicotine, the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes, defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to insure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects
of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; (vi) the disclosure on defendants’ public document websites and in the Minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or
administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021, with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality; (vii) the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to
the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the Federal Trade Commission, for a period of ten years; (viii) certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any
cigarette brands, brand names, formulas or cigarette businesses within the United States; and (ix) payment of the government’s costs in bringing the action.

In September 2006, defendants filed notices of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In
September 2006, the trial court denied defendants’ motion to stay the judgment pending defendants’ appeals, and defendants then filed an emergency motion with the Court of Appeals to stay enforcement of the judgment pending their appeals.
In October, the

-36-


government filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals. In October 2006, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals granted defendants’ motion
and stayed the trial court’s judgment pending its review of the decision. Certain defendants, including PM USA and ALG, have filed a motion to clarify the trial court’s August 2006 Final Judgment and Remedial Order.

Lights/Ultra Lights Cases

Overview

Plaintiffs in these class actions (some of which have not been certified as such), allege, among other things, that the uses of the
terms “Lights” and/or “Ultra Lights” constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law fraud, or RICO violations, and seek injunctive and equitable relief, including restitution and, in certain cases, punitive damages.
These class actions have been brought against PM USA and, in certain instances, ALG and PMI or its subsidiaries, on behalf of individuals who purchased and consumed various brands of cigarettes, including

Marlboro Lights, Marlboro Ultra Lights,
Virginia Slims Lights

and

Superslims, Merit Lights

and

Cambridge Lights.

Defenses raised in these cases include lack of misrepresentation, lack of causation, injury, and damages, the statute of limitations, express preemption by
the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and implied preemption by the policies and directives of the Federal Trade Commission, non-liability under state statutory provisions exempting conduct that complies with federal regulatory
directives, and the First Amendment. Twenty cases are pending in Arkansas (2), Delaware (1), Florida (1), Illinois (1), Kansas (1), Louisiana (1), Maine (1), Massachusetts (1), Minnesota (1), Missouri (1), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (1), New
Jersey (1), New York (1), Oregon (1), Tennessee (1), Washington (1), and West Virginia (2). In addition, there are two cases pending in Israel. Other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions against ALG, PMI, and PM USA.

To date, trial courts in Arizona, Oregon and Washington have refused to
certify a class, an appellate court in Florida has overturned class certification by a trial court, the Ohio Supreme Court has overturned class certifications in two cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has dismissed a
purported Lights class action brought in Louisiana federal court (

Sullivan)

on the grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling & Advertising Act and the Supreme Court of Illinois has
overturned a judgment in favor of a plaintiff class in the

Price

case, which is discussed below. Intermediate appellate courts in Oregon and Washington have denied plaintiffs’ motions for interlocutory review of the trial courts’
refusals to certify a class. Plaintiffs in the Oregon case failed to appeal by the deadline for doing so. Plaintiffs in the case in Washington have sought further review. Plaintiffs in the Florida case have petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for
further review, and the Supreme Court has ordered briefing on why its

Engle

opinion should not control the decision in that case.

Trial courts have certified classes against PM USA in Massachusetts (

Aspinall

), Minnesota (

Curtis

), Missouri (

Craft

) and New York
(

Schwab)

. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has granted plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari on the issue of the appropriate venue in a purported Lights class action brought in Arkansas (

Watson

). PM USA has
appealed or otherwise challenged these class certification orders. Developments in these cases include:

•

Aspinall:

In August 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the class certification order. In April 2006, plaintiffs filed a
motion to redefine the class to include all persons who after November 25, 1994 purchased packs or cartons of

Marlboro Lights

cigarettes in Massachusetts that displayed the legend “Lower Tar & Nicotine” (the original
class definition did not include a reference to lower tar and nicotine). In August 2006, the trial court denied PM USA’s motion for summary judgment based on the state consumer protection statutory exemption and federal preemption. On motion of
the parties, the trial court has subsequently reported its decision to deny summary judgment to the appeals court for review and the trial court proceedings are stayed pending completion of the appellate review.

-37-


•

Curtis:

In April 2005, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied PM USA’s petition for interlocutory review of the trial court’s class
certification order. In September 2005, PM USA removed

Curtis

to federal court based on the Eighth Circuit’s decision in

Watson,

which upheld the removal of a Lights case to federal court based on the federal officer jurisdiction
of the Federal Trade Commission

.

In February 2006, the federal court denied plaintiffs’ motion to remand the case to state court. The case is now pending in federal court. The case has been stayed pending the outcome of

Dahl v. R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co.

, which was argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in December 2006.

•

Craft:

In August 2005, a Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification order. In September 2005, PM USA removed

Craft

to
federal court based on the Eighth Circuit’s decision in

Watson.

In March 2006, the federal trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion and remanded the case to the Missouri state trial court. In May 2006, the Missouri Supreme Court
declined to review the trial court’s class certification decision.

•

Schwab:

In September 2005, the trial court granted in part defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs’
claims for equitable relief and denied a number of plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment. In November 2005, the trial court ruled that the plaintiffs would be permitted to calculate damages on an aggregate basis and use “fluid
recovery” theories to allocate them among class members. In September 2006, the trial court denied defendants’ summary judgment motions and granted plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a nationwide class of all United States
residents that purchased cigarettes in the United States that were labeled “light” or “lights” from the first date defendants began selling such cigarettes until the date trial commences. The court also declined to certify the
order for interlocutory appeal, declined to stay the case and ordered jury selection to begin in January 2007, with trial scheduled to begin immediately after the jury is impaneled. In October 2006, a single judge of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit granted PM USA’s petition for a temporary stay of pre-trial and trial proceedings pending disposition of the petitions for stay and interlocutory review by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals. In November
2006, the Second Circuit granted interlocutory review of the trial court’s class certification order and stayed the case before the trial court pending the appeal.

In addition to these cases, in December 2005, in the

Miner

case pending in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Arkansas, plaintiffs moved for certification of a class composed of individuals who purchased

Marlboro Lights

or

Cambridge Lights

brands in Arkansas, California, Colorado, and Michigan. In December 2005, defendants filed a
motion to stay plaintiffs’ motion for class certification until the court ruled on PM USA’s motion to transfer venue to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. This motion was granted in January 2006. PM
USA’s motion for summary judgment based on preemption and the Arkansas statutory exemption is pending. Following the filing of this motion, plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss

Miner

without prejudice, which PM USA opposed. The court
then stayed the case pending the United States Supreme Court’s decision on a petition for writ of certiorari in the

Watson

case. In January 2007, the United States Supreme Court granted the petition for writ of certiorari. In addition,
plaintiffs’ motions for class certification are pending in cases in Kansas, New Jersey, New Mexico and Tennessee.

The Price Case

Trial in the

Price

case commenced in state court in Illinois in January 2003, and in March 2003, the judge found in favor of the plaintiff class and awarded approximately $7.1 billion in compensatory damages and $3
billion in punitive damages against PM USA. In April 2003, the judge reduced the amount of the appeal bond that PM USA must provide and ordered PM USA to place a pre-existing 7.0%, $6 billion long-term note from ALG to PM USA in an escrow account
with an Illinois financial institution. (Since this note is the result of an intercompany financing arrangement, it does not appear

-38-


on the consolidated balance sheets of ALG.) The judge’s order also required PM USA to make cash deposits with the clerk of the Madison County Circuit Court in the
following amounts: beginning October 1, 2003, an amount equal to the interest earned by PM USA on the ALG note ($210 million every six months), an additional $800 million in four equal quarterly installments between September 2003 and June 2004
and the payments of principal on the note, which are due in April 2008, 2009 and 2010. Plaintiffs appealed the judge’s order reducing the bond. In July 2003, the Illinois Fifth District Court of Appeals ruled that the trial court had exceeded
its authority in reducing the bond. In September 2003, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the reduced bond set by the trial court and announced it would hear PM USA’s appeal on the merits without the need for intermediate appellate court review.
In December 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions that the case be dismissed. In May 2006, the Illinois Supreme Court denied
plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing. In June 2006, the Illinois Supreme Court ordered the return to PM USA of approximately $2.2 billion being held in escrow to secure the appeal bond in the case and terminated PM USA’s obligations to pay
administrative fees to the Madison County Clerk. In November 2006, the United States Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari and in December 2006 the Circuit Court of Madison County entered final judgment in favor of PM
USA and dismissed the case with prejudice. In December 2006, the pre-existing 7.0%, $6 billion long-term note from ALG to PM USA that was in escrow pending the outcome of plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme
Court was returned to PM USA. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to vacate or withdraw the

Price

decision based upon the United States Supreme Court’s grant of the petition for writ of certiorari in the

Watson

case discussed above. PM
USA has filed its opposition to this motion.

Certain Other
Tobacco-Related Litigation

Tobacco Price
Cases

:

As of December 31, 2006, two cases were pending in Kansas and New Mexico in which plaintiffs allege that defendants, including PM USA and PMI, conspired to fix cigarette prices in violation of antitrust laws. ALG and
PMI are defendants in the case in Kansas. Plaintiffs’ motions for class certification have been granted in both cases. In February 2005, the New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification decision. In June 2006, defendants’
motion for summary judgment was granted in the New Mexico case. Plaintiffs in the New Mexico case have appealed.

Wholesale Leaders Cases

:

In June 2003, certain wholesale distributors of cigarettes filed suit in Tennessee against PM USA seeking to
enjoin the PM USA “2003 Wholesale Leaders” (“WL”) program that became available to wholesalers in June 2003. The complaint alleges that the WL program constitutes unlawful price discrimination and is an attempt to monopolize. In
addition to an injunction, plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest. The states of Tennessee and Mississippi intervened as plaintiffs in this litigation. In August 2003, the trial court issued a
preliminary injunction, subject to plaintiffs’ posting a bond in the amount of $1 million, enjoining PM USA from implementing certain discount terms with respect to the sixteen wholesale distributor plaintiffs, and PM USA appealed. In September
2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted PM USA’s motion to stay the injunction pending PM USA’s expedited appeal. In January 2004, Tennessee filed a motion to dismiss its complaint, and its complaint was
dismissed without prejudice in March 2004. In August 2005, the trial court granted PM USA’s motion for summary judgment, dismissed the case, and dissolved the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs appealed, and, in April 2006, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard oral argument on plaintiffs’ appeal. A decision by the Court of Appeals is pending.

Cigarette Contraband Cases

:  In May 2000 and August 2001, various departments of Colombia and the European Community and 10 Member States
filed suits in the United States against ALG and certain of its subsidiaries, including PM USA and PMI, and other cigarette manufacturers and their

-39-


affiliates, alleging that defendants sold to distributors cigarettes that would be illegally imported into various jurisdictions. In February 2002, the federal
district court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss the actions. In January 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissals of the cases based on the common law Revenue Rule, which bars a foreign
government from bringing civil claims in U.S. courts for the recovery of lost taxes. It is possible that future litigation related to cigarette contraband issues may be brought.

Cases Under the California Business and Professions Code

:

In June 1997 and July 1998, two suits (

Brown

and

Daniels

) were filed in California state court alleging that domestic cigarette manufacturers, including PM USA and others, have violated California Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500 regarding unfair, unlawful and
fraudulent business practices. Class certification was granted in both cases as to plaintiffs’ claims that class members are entitled to reimbursement of the costs of cigarettes purchased during the class periods and injunctive relief. In
September 2002, the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all claims in one of the cases (

Daniels

), and plaintiffs appealed. In October 2004, the California Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the trial
court’s ruling, and also denied plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing. In February 2005, the California Supreme Court agreed to hear plaintiffs’ appeal. In September 2004, the trial court in the other case granted defendants’ motion
for summary judgment as to plaintiffs’ claims attacking defendants’ cigarette advertising and promotion and denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claims based on allegedly false affirmative statements.
Plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing was denied. In March 2005, the court granted defendants’ motion to decertify the class based on a recent change in California law, which, in two July 2006 opinions, the California Supreme Court ruled
applicable to pending cases. Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the order that decertified the class was denied, and plaintiffs have appealed. In September 2006, an intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court’s order
decertifying the class in

Brown

. In November 2006, the California Supreme Court accepted review of the appellate court’s decision.

In May 2004, a lawsuit

(Gurevitch)

was filed in California state court on behalf of a purported class of all California residents who purchased the

Merit

brand of cigarettes since July 2000 to the present alleging that defendants, including PM USA, violated California’s Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500 regarding unfair, unlawful and fraudulent business practices,
including false and misleading advertising. The complaint also alleges violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, disgorgement, restitution, and attorneys’ fees. In July 2005,
defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted; however, plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend the complaint was also granted, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2005. In October 2005, the court stayed this action pending
the California Supreme Court’s rulings on two cases not involving PM USA. In July 2006, the California Supreme Court issued rulings in the two cases and held that a recent change in California law known as Proposition 64, which limits the
ability to bring a lawsuit to only those plaintiffs who have “suffered injury in fact” and “lost money or property” as a result of defendant’s alleged statutory violations, properly applies to pending cases. In September
2006, the stay was lifted and defendants filed their demurrer to plaintiffs’ amended complaint.

Certain Other Actions

IRS Challenges to PMCC Leases

:

The IRS concluded its examination of ALG’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999, and issued a final Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on
March 15, 2006. The RAR disallowed benefits pertaining to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999. Altria Group, Inc. has agreed with all conclusions of the RAR, with the exception of the disallowance of
benefits pertaining to several PMCC leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999. PMCC will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately $150 million of tax and net interest
assessed

-40-


and paid with regard to them. The IRS may in the future challenge and disallow more of PMCC’s leveraged leases based on recent Revenue Rulings, a recent IRS
Notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases (lease-in/lease-out (“LILO”) and sale-in/lease-out (“SILO”) transactions). PMCC believes that the position and supporting case law described in the RAR,
Revenue Rulings and the IRS Notice are incorrectly applied to PMCC’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the IRS’s position. PMCC and ALG intend to vigorously
defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation. In this regard, on October 16, 2006, PMCC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to claim refunds for a portion of these tax
payments and associated interest and intends to file complaints for the remainder. However, should PMCC’s position not be upheld, PMCC may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its
earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases, which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of Altria Group, Inc. in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. PMCC considered this
matter in its adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 and FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2.

It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases. An
unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to
prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 40 states now limit the
dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.

ALG and its
subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Except as discussed elsewhere in this
Item 3.

Legal Proceedings:

(i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.

It is possible that Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated results of operations, cash
flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, management
believes the litigation environment has substantially improved. ALG and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has a number of valid defenses to the
litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, ALG and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular
cases if they believe it is in the best interests of ALG’s stockholders to do so.

Third-Party Guarantees

At December 31,
2006, Altria Group, Inc.’s third-party guarantees, which are primarily related to excise taxes, and acquisition and divestiture activities, approximated $305 million, of which $286 million have no specified expiration dates. The remainder
expire through 2023, with $1 million expiring during 2007. Altria Group, Inc. is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third

-41-


party fails to make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. Altria Group, Inc. has a liability of $38 million on its consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2006, relating to these guarantees. In the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of ALG have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Altria Group, Inc. carried out an evaluation, with the participation of Altria Group, Inc.’s management, including ALG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Altria Group, Inc.’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based upon that evaluation, ALG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Altria Group, Inc.’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes in Altria Group, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Altria Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting.

(b)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Altria Group, Inc.’s management evaluated, with the participation of ALG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in Altria
Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and determined that there has been no change in Altria Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Altria Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting. However, as noted within Item 4 of Altria Group, Inc.’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
September 30, 2006, Kraft entered into a seven-year agreement in April 2006 to receive information technology services from Electronic Data Systems (“EDS”). Pursuant to this agreement, Kraft began to transition certain of its
processes and procedures into the EDS control environment during the quarter ended September 30, 2006. As Kraft migrates to the EDS environment, its management ensures that key controls of Kraft are mapped to applicable EDS controls, tests
transition controls prior to the migration date of those controls, and as appropriate, maintains and evaluates controls over the flow of information to and from EDS. Kraft expects this transition period to continue for three years. In addition, as
also noted within Item 4 of Altria Group, Inc.’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2006, PMI has begun a process of centralizing the functions of transaction processing, purchasing and factory
maintenance. As PMI migrates to this new environment, its management takes appropriate actions to ensure the continuity of key controls, and the transitions are reviewed as part of its testing of internal controls as they relate to the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements.

See Exhibit 13 for the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm containing an
attestation thereto.
