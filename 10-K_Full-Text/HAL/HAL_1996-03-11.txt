PART I

Item  1. Business.

     General  Development  of Business.  Halliburton  Company (the  Company) was
established in 1919 and incorporated  under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1924. The Company  provides energy  services and  engineering  and  construction
services.  Information  related to acquisitions and dispositions is set forth in
Note 13 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.
     Financial Information About Business Segments.  The Company is comprised of
two business  segments.  See Note 9 to the  financial  statements of this Annual
Report for financial information about these two business segments.
     Description  of Services and  Products.  The  following is a summary  which
briefly describes the Company's services and products for each business segment.
     Halliburton  Energy  Services  (Energy  Services)  provides a wide range of
services  and  products to provide  integrated  solutions  to  customers  in the
exploration,  development and production of oil and natural gas. Energy Services
operates  worldwide  serving  major oil  companies,  independent  operators  and
national oil companies.  The services and products  provided by Energy  Services
include cementing,  casing equipment and water control services;  completion and
production products;  directional drilling systems,  measurement while drilling,
logging while drilling and mud logging services; open and cased hole logging and
perforating  services  and  logging  and  perforating  products;  well  testing,
reservoir  description and evaluation services,  tubing conveyed well completion
systems and reservoir engineering services;  stimulation,  sand control services
and coiled  tubing  services;  and wellhead  pressure  control  equipment,  well
control,  hydraulic  workover  and  downhole  video  services.
     Engineering and Construction  Services (Brown & Root) includes services for
both land and marine activities. Included are technical and economic feasibility
studies, site evaluation, licensing, conceptual design, process design, detailed
engineering,  procurement, project and construction management, construction and
start-up  assistance  of electric  utility  plants,  chemical and  petrochemical
plants, refineries,  pulp and paper mills, metal processing plants, highways and
bridges, subsea construction,  fabrication and installation of subsea pipelines,
offshore platforms, production platform facilities, marine engineering and other
marine related  projects,  contract  maintenance  and operations and maintenance
services  for  both  industry  and  government,  engineering  and  environmental
consulting and waste management services for industry, utilities and government,
and remedial  engineering and  construction  services for hazardous waste sites.
     Markets  and  Competition.  The  Company  is  one of  the  world's  largest
diversified energy services and engineering and construction services companies.
The  Company's  services  and products  are sold in highly  competitive  markets
throughout the world.  Competition in both services and products is based upon a
combination of price,  service  (including  the ability to deliver  services and
products on an "as needed where needed" basis),  product  quality,  warranty and
technical  proficiency.  Some Energy  Services' and Engineering and Construction
Services'  customers have  indicated a preference  for  integrated  services and
solutions. These integrated solutions, in the case of Energy Services, relate to
all phases of  exploration  and  production  of oil and gas, and, in the case of
Engineering  and  Construction  Services,   relate  to  all  phases  of  design,
procurement,  construction,  project  management and  maintenance of a facility.
Demand for these types of integrated  solutions is based  primarily upon quality
of service, technical proficiency and overall price.
     The Company conducts  business  worldwide in over 100 countries.  Since the
market for the  Company's  services  and  products is so large and crosses  many
geographic lines, a meaningful  estimate of the number of competitors  cannot be
made.  The  markets  are,  however,  highly  competitive  with many  substantial
companies  operating  in each  market.  Generally,  the  Company's  services and
products are marketed through its own servicing and sales organizations. A small
percentage  of sales of Energy  Services'  products is made by supply stores and
third-party representatives.
     Operations  in  some  countries  may be  affected  by  unsettled  political
conditions,  expropriation or other governmental  actions,  and exchange control
and currency  problems.  The Company believes the geographic  diversification of
its business  activities reduces the risk that loss of its operations in any one
country  would be material to the  conduct of its  operations  taken as a whole.
Information regarding the Company's exposures to foreign currency  fluctuations,
risk  concentration and financial  instruments used to minimize risk is included
in Note 11 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.


     Customers and Backlog.  Substantially  all of the Company's Energy Services
and a significant  portion of Engineering and Construction  Services are related
to the energy industry. In 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively,  78%, 78% and 79%
of the  Company's  revenues  were derived from the sale of products and services
to,  including  construction  for, the energy industry.  The following  schedule
summarizes the backlog of engineering and construction  projects at December 31,
1995 and 1994:

     It is  estimated  that nearly 65% of the backlog  existing at December  31,
1995  will  be  completed  during  1996.  The  Company  does  not  believe  that
engineering  and  construction  backlog  should  necessarily  be relied on as an
indication of future operating results since such backlog figures are subject to
substantial fluctuations. Arrangements included in backlog are in many instances
extremely complex,  nonrepetitive in nature and may fluctuate in contract value.
Many contracts do not provide for a fixed amount and are subject to modification
or  termination  by the  customer.  Due to the size of  certain  contracts,  the
termination  or  modification  of any one or more  contracts  or the addition of
other contracts may have a substantial and immediate  effect on backlog.  Orders
for Energy  Services are  generally  placed by customers on the basis of current
need.  Therefore,  backlog of orders for these  services  and  products  are not
material.
     Raw  Materials.  Raw  materials  essential  to the  Company's  business are
normally readily available.  Where the Company is dependent on a single supplier
for any materials  essential to its business,  the Company is confident  that it
could make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of interruption in
the supply of such materials.
     Research, Development and Patents. The Company maintains an active research
and development  program to assist in the  improvement of existing  products and
processes,  the development of new products and processes and the improvement of
engineering  standards  and  practices  that  serve  the  changing  needs of its
customers.  Information relating to expenditures for research and development is
included in Note 1 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.
     The Company  owns a large  number of patents and has pending a  substantial
number of patent  applications  covering various  products and processes.  It is
also licensed  under  patents  owned by others.  The Company does not consider a
particular patent or group of patents to be material to the Company's business.
     Seasonality.  Weather  and natural  phenomena  can  temporarily  affect the
performance of the Company's services.  Winter months in the Northern Hemisphere
tend to affect operations negatively,  but the widespread geographical locations
of the Company's services serve to mitigate the seasonal nature of the Company's
business.
     Employees.  At December 31, 1995 the Company employed  approximately 57,300
people of which 23,300 were located outside the United States.
     Regulation.  The  Company  is subject  to  various  environmental  laws and
regulations.   Compliance  with  such  requirements  has  neither  substantially
increased capital  expenditures or adversely affected the Company's  competitive
position,  nor materially affected the Company's earnings.  The Company does not
anticipate  any such material  adverse  effects in the  foreseeable  future as a
result  of  such  existing  laws  and  regulations.  Note  10 to  the  financial
statements  of this Annual  Report  discusses  the  Company's  involvement  as a
potentially  responsible  party in  remedial  activities  to  clean  up  various
"Superfund" sites.

Item 2.   Properties.

     Information  relating  to  lease  payments  is  included  in Note 10 to the

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  AND  FINANCIAL
CONDITION

     BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENT  AND  OUTLOOK  Approximately  80%  of  the  Company's
revenues  are  derived  from  services  and  products  delivered  to the  energy
industry. The Company operates in over 100 countries around the world to provide
a  variety  of  energy  services  and  engineering  and  construction  services.
Operations in some countries may be affected by unsettled political  conditions,
expropriation or other governmental  actions,  and exchange control and currency
problems.  The Company believes the geographic  diversification  of its business
activities reduces the risk that loss of its operations in any one country would
be material to the conduct of its  operations as a whole.  
     The energy industry.  The energy industry has experienced declining selling
prices per barrel of oil equivalent, adjusted for inflation, during the past ten
years. Per barrel costs of finding,  developing and producing  hydrocarbons have
also  declined.  This is the result of several  factors.  Energy  companies have
restructured  to  reduce  costs.   Technological  advances  such  as  horizontal
drilling,  geosteering,  logging while drilling,  multi-lateral completions, 3-D
seismic and coiled tubing  applications  are  decreasing  costs,  improving well
productivity and optimizing the ultimate  recovery of hydrocarbon  reserves.  In
addition,  there is a trend toward incentive  contracts between energy companies
and their suppliers,  alliances,  contracts to produce, outsourcing arrangements
and integrated  solution approaches in order to reduce costs and share risks and
gains from  efficiencies.  Although in early stages of development,  the Company
expects that the  integrated  solutions  approach  will be a major future growth
area. The current  outlook based upon  published  sources is that demand for oil
and natural gas will increase  with economic  growth and that prices for oil and
natural gas will be stable near term and increase  moderately  longer term.  One
major  uncertainty  is the potential  negative  impact on oil prices should Iraq
reenter the market.  Significant  market areas with  increasing  exploration and
development  activities  include  international  and the  Gulf  of  Mexico.
     Services to the energy  industry.  The operations of the Company devoted to
the energy  industry are impacted by changes in oil and natural gas  development
activities in major producing areas  throughout the world.  These activities are
sensitive to government  actions in major producing  countries,  oil and natural
gas  prices and  capital  spending  for  hydrocarbon  exploration,  development,
production,  processing and pipeline delivery networks.  In response to customer
efforts to reduce costs and increase production, the Company has reorganized its
operations  to reduce its overall  service and product  delivery  costs  through
increased productivity and cost efficiencies.  The Company has the capability to
provide a wide range of services  needed to operate an existing  oil and natural
gas field or a new field and to handle all phases of bringing  energy to market,
including  drilling and completing wells,  building pipelines and other means of
transportation and building refineries. The Company provides project management,
development planning,  well construction,  production enhancement and production
maintenance  services to the energy  industry  through its Energy  Services  and
Engineering and Construction  Services segments.  Based upon the outlook for the
energy  industry,   the  Company  expects  revenue  growth  in  1996  with  some
improvement in operating margins.  
     Other industries  served.  The remaining 20% of the Company's  revenues are
derived from engineering, construction,  maintenance, environmental services and
logistical support services to governmental and industrial  customers worldwide.
According to published sources, these markets are expected to grow 15% to 20% in
1996.  These  markets are  sensitive  to changes in the  economies of the world,
government actions in the major economies and capital spending by industries and
governments  throughout the world. 
     The Company's outlook.  The Company's outlook could be negatively  impacted
by any of the factors noted above including  significant  changes in oil and gas
prices, world economic and political  conditions,  and new or modified embargoes
against oil and gas producing countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     Revenues  in 1995  were  $5,698.7  million,  an  increase  of 3% over  1994
revenues of $5,510.2  million but a 6% decrease  from 1993  revenues of $6,094.1
million.  Excluding  the revenues of businesses  sold in 1994,  revenues in 1995
increased by 5% over 1994 revenues and by 1% over 1993  revenues.  Approximately
51% of the  Company's  consolidated  revenues  were derived  from  international
activities  in 1995  compared  to 45% in  1994  and  43% in  1993.  Consolidated
international revenues increased 17% in 1995 over 1994 and 19% over 1993. Energy
Services 1995 revenues  increased by 4% to $2,623.4  million in 1995 compared to
1994  but  declined  by 11%  from  1993  revenues.  Excluding  the  revenues  of
businesses sold in 1994, Energy Services 1995 revenues increased by 7% over 1994
and  6%  over  1993  primarily  due to  higher  international  activity  levels,
partially offset by a decline in the United States. Energy Services revenues per
rotary rig, excluding the revenues of businesses sold in 1994, were up by 11% in
1995 over 1994 and up by 6% over 1993.  The increases in revenues per rotary rig
were  accomplished  at the same time the rotary rig count declined by 3% in 1995
compared to 1994 and was the same as 1993. International revenues per rotary rig
increased 15% in 1995 over 1994 and 10% over 1993.  United  States  revenues per
rotary  rig  increased  5% in 1995  over 1994 but was down  about 1% from  1993.
Engineering and Construction  Services 1995 revenues increased by 3% to $3,075.3
million in 1995 compared to 1994, but decreased by 2% compared to 1993.


     Operating  income was $383.2  million in 1995 compared to $236.1 million in
1994 and an operating loss of $91.5 million in 1993. Excluding the special items
and businesses sold in 1994 as described below,  1995 operating income increased
by 54% over  1994  operating  income  of  $248.4  million  and by 68% over  1993
operating  income  of  $227.7  million.   Approximately  63%  of  the  Company's
consolidated operating income was derived from international  activities in 1995
compared to 46% in 1994 and 60% in 1993.  Consolidated  international  operating
margins were 8% in 1995 compared to 5% in 1994 and 6% in 1993.  Energy  Services
operating income in 1995 was $313.7 million,  compared to $191.8 million in 1994
and a loss of $148.4 million in 1993. Excluding the special items and businesses
sold in 1994 as described  below,  operating  income in 1995  increased 54% over
1994 and 84% over 1993.  Operating  income  increased in all geographic  regions
worldwide.  Operating  margins  during 1995,  1994 and 1993 were 12%, 8% and 7%,
respectively.  The increase in 1995 margins was due to lower  indirect costs and
international  revenue  growth.  Lower  margins  in 1994 were due  primarily  to
decreased  activities  in the North Sea,  Middle East and Asia  Pacific,  market
disturbances in Nigeria and Yemen,  unsettled  economic,  political and business
conditions in the CIS and pricing  pressures in the United  States.  Engineering
and Construction  Services  operating income in 1995 increased 53% over 1994 and
31% over  1993 to $103.0  million.  The  increase  in 1995  operating  income is
primarily  due to improved  performance  in  international  marine  construction
activities and  petrochemical  engineering  and  construction  activities in the
Middle East.  Operating  income in 1994 includes a $5.0 million gain on the sale
of an environmental remediation subsidiary.



     Businesses  sold  in  1994  were  the  geophysical  products  and  services
business, natural gas compression business and the workover platform business.
     Special  items  recognized  in 1994 and 1993 are as follows:  In 1994,  the
Company  sold its natural  gas  compression  business  and  recognized  a $102.0
million gain in other  nonoperating  income ($64.3 million net of income taxes).
In  addition,  the Company  recognized a $42.6  million  charge  against  Energy
Services  operating  income  ($27.7  million net of income  taxes) to  recognize
severance costs for the termination of about 2,700  employees.  The terminations
mostly  impacted  middle and senior  management  levels and various product line
support  and  general  and  administrative   employees.  In  1993,  the  Company
recognized a $301.8  million charge against  Energy  Services  operating  income
($263.8 million net of income taxes) to reflect the net realizable  value of the
Company's  geophysical  operations  which were disposed of in January 1994.  The
Company  also  provided a $20.0  million  charge in 1993  ($13.0  million net of
income taxes)  related to Energy  Services  non-geophysical  employee  severance
costs.  The  provision for income taxes in 1993 was reduced by $40.4 million due
to a settlement with the Internal  Revenue  Service  relating to tax assessments
for the 1980 - 1987  years and also  reduced by $6.4  million  due to changes in
Federal income tax laws. See Note 5 to the financial statements.
     Interest  income  increased in 1995 to $27.8  million from $16.1 million in
1994 and $14.0 million in 1993 due primarily to higher levels of invested cash.
     Foreign  currency gains  (losses)  netted to a gain of $1.5 million in 1995
compared to losses of $16.0 million in 1994 and $20.8 million in 1993.  Included
in the 1995 results were gains from  devaluations  of the Nigerian Naira and the
Venezuelan  Bolivar  offset  by  losses in other  currencies,  particularly  the
Mexican Peso. Losses in 1994 and 1993 related primarily to Brazil and Venezuela.
Losses in 1993 also included losses from certain African currency exposures. The
Company  routinely  hedges its exposures to currency  fluctuations  using simple
currency derivative  instruments.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for a
description of such exposures and derivative instruments.
     Provision  for income taxes was higher in 1995 than in 1994 and 1993 due to
increased income. The effective income tax rates,  excluding the businesses sold
in 1994 and the special items outlined  above,  declined to 36% in 1995 from 42%
in 1994 and 47% in 1993. The declines in the effective  income tax rate were due
primarily  to the  decrease  in losses not  currently  benefited  and  increased
realization of available net operating losses.





     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS consists of the Company's Insurance Services Group.
The  Company   declared  a  dividend  on  December  26,  1995  and  subsequently
distributed its property and casualty insurance subsidiary,  Highlands Insurance
Group,  Inc. (HIGI),  to its shareholders in a tax-free  spin-off on January 23,
1996.  The operations of the Insurance  Services  Group have been  classified as
discontinued  operations.  During 1995,  HIGI  increased  its reserves for claim
losses and related  expenses and  provisions  for certain  legal  matters  which
together with certain other  provisions  associated with the Company's  complete
exit from the insurance  industry resulted in a $67.2 million charge against net
earnings. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company ended the year 1995 with cash and equivalents of $174.9 million
compared with $375.3  million in 1994 and $7.5 million in 1993.  The decrease in
cash and  equivalents  is  primarily  due to the  prepayment  of debt of  $432.7
million, partially offset by increased cash flows from operating activities. The
Company's cash return on gross invested  capital,  consistent with the Company's
Cash Value  Added  performance  measurement,  adopted  in 1994,  was 13% in 1995
compared to 9% in 1994 and 5% in 1993.  This is due to improved  operating  cash
flows,  dispositions of businesses and  unproductive  assets,  the prepayment of
debt and the spin-off of HIGI.
     CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING  ACTIVITIES  were $632.0 million in 1995 compared
to  $415.4  million  in 1994 and  $269.6  million  in 1993.  The  increases  are
attributable  primarily to increased income and, in 1995,  reductions in working
capital.
     CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING  ACTIVITIES  used $238.3 million in 1995 compared
to $210.9  million in cash  provided in 1994 and $323.4  million of cash used in
1993. Capital expenditures  increased in 1995 by 24% over 1994 and 18% over 1993
mostly  representing  investments  in new  technologies  such as  logging  while
drilling and multi-lateral  completions.  The Company's capital expenditures are
expected to continue to increase in 1996 as new technologies will continue to be
developed  and  deployed.  In 1994,  the Company sold  substantially  all of the
assets of its geophysical  services and products business for $190.0 million and
its natural gas compression business for $205.0 million.
     CASH  FLOWS  USED FOR  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  were  $591.3  million in 1995
compared to $252.7  million in 1994 and $81.0  million in 1993.  The increase in
outflows  is due to higher  payments of  long-term  indebtedness.  In 1995,  the
entire outstanding principal amounts of the zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures of $390.7  million and the $42.0 million term loan were redeemed with
available cash resources.  See Note 6 to the financial statements.  In 1994, the
Company  redeemed the remaining  $23.8 million of its 10.2%  debentures and made
$48.8 million in installments on the $73.8 million note issued by the Company to
the buyer of the  geophysical  business.  In 1993,  the Company  redeemed  $56.5
million  principal amount of its debentures.  Total debt was 11%, 26% and 27% of
total  capitalization  at the end of 1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.  The
Company has the ability to borrow  additional  short-term and long-term funds if
necessary.  See  Note 6 to the  financial  statements  regarding  the  Company's
various  short-term lines of credit. In 1993, in connection with the acquisition
of the drilling systems business,  the Company issued 6,857,000 shares of Common
Stock  previously held as treasury stock valued at  approximately  $247 million.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
     The  Company is  involved as a  potentially  responsible  party in remedial
activities to clean up various  "Superfund"  sites under applicable  Federal law
which  imposes  joint and  several  liability,  if the harm is  indivisible,  on
certain persons without regard to fault, the legality of the original  disposal,
or  ownership  of the  site.  Although  it is very  difficult  to  quantify  the
potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management of
the Company  believes  that any liability of the Company with respect to all but
one of such  sites  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the  results of
operations  of  the  Company.  See  Note  10 to  the  financial  statements  for
additional information on the one site.



RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

     Halliburton Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of its
published financial  statements.  The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States
and,  as  such,  include  amounts  based  on  judgments  and  estimates  made by
management.  The Company  also  prepared the other  information  included in the
annual  report and is  responsible  for its  accuracy and  consistency  with the
financial statements.
     The financial  statements have been audited by the  independent  accounting
firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted  access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the
board of directors and committees of the board.
     The  Company   maintains  a  system  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  which is intended to provide  reasonable  assurance to the Company's
management  and  board of  directors  regarding  the  preparation  of  financial
statements.  The  system  includes a  documented  organizational  structure  and
division of responsibility,  established policies and procedures including codes
of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate, which are communicated throughout
the Company, and the careful selection,  training and development of our people.
Internal  auditors  monitor the  operation  of the internal  control  system and
report  findings and  recommendations  to management and the board of directors,
and  corrective  actions  are taken to address  control  deficiencies  and other
opportunities  for  improving  the  system as they are  identified.  The  board,
operating  through its audit committee,  which is composed entirely of directors
who are not  officers or employees  of the  Company,  provides  oversight to the
financial reporting process.
     There  are  inherent  limitations  in the  effectiveness  of any  system of
internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or  overriding  of controls.  Accordingly,  even an effective  internal  control
system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.  Furthermore,  the  effectiveness of an internal control system may
change over time.
     The Company  assessed its internal  control  system in relation to criteria
for effective internal control over financial  reporting  described in "Internal
Control-Integrated   Framework"   issued   by  the   Committee   of   Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  upon that  assessment,  the
Company  believes that, as of December 31, 1995, its system of internal  control
over financial reporting met those criteria.

REPORT  OF  INDEPENDENT  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTANTS  To the  Shareholders  and Board of
Directors,
Halliburton Company:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton
Company (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiary  companies as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
shareholders'  equity for each of the three years in the period  ended  December
31, 1995.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of Halliburton
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of Halliburton
Company  and  subsidiary  companies  as of December  31, 1995 and 1994,  and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31,  1995,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note  1. Significant Accounting Policies
     The  Company  employs  accounting  policies  that  are in  accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States. The preparation
of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  Company  management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements,  and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.
     Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  All material
intercompany  accounts and  transactions  are  eliminated.  Investments in other
affiliated  companies in which the Company has at least 20%  ownership  and does
not  have  management  control  are  accounted  for on  the  equity  method.  In
connection  with the  discontinuance  of the Company's  insurance  segment,  the
Company  has adopted a  classified  balance  sheet  format.  Certain  prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
     Revenues  and  Income  Recognition.  The  Company  recognizes  revenues  as
services are rendered or products are shipped.  The distinction between services
and product sales is based upon the overall  business  intent of the  particular
business  operation.  Revenues from  construction  contracts are reported on the
percentage of completion  method of accounting  using  measurements  of progress
toward completion  appropriate for the work performed.  All known or anticipated
losses on any  contracts  are  provided  for  currently.  Claims for  additional
compensation are recognized during the period such claims are resolved.
     Research and Development.  Research and development expenses are charged to
income as incurred.  Such charges were $88.5 million in 1995,  $109.5 million in
1994 and $126.5 million in 1993. In addition,  the Company capitalized  software
development costs related primarily to integrated  information  technologies and
project  management  of $3.9  million  in 1995,  $6.4  million in 1994 and $39.8
million in 1993.
     Income Per Share.  Income per share is based on the weighted average number
of common  shares and common  share  equivalents  outstanding  during each year.
Common share equivalents  included in the computation  represent shares issuable
upon assumed exercise of stock options which have a dilutive effect.
     Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
     Receivables.  The Company's  receivables are generally not  collateralized.
Notes and accounts  receivable at December 31, 1995 include $22.3 million ($30.1
million at December 31, 1994) due from customers in accordance  with  applicable
retainage  provisions of  engineering  and  construction  contracts,  which will
become billable upon future  deliveries or completion of such contracts.  Of the
December  31,  1995  amount,  approximately  $17.8  million  is  expected  to be
collected  during 1996 and the  remainder is due in subsequent  years.  Unbilled
work on uncompleted  contracts generally  represents work currently billable and
such work is usually billed during normal billing processes in the next month.
     Inventories.  Inventories  are  stated  at cost  which is not in  excess of
market.  Cost  represents  invoice or production cost for new items and original
cost  less  allowance  for  condition  for  used  material  returned  to  stock.
Production  cost includes  material,  labor and  manufacturing  overhead.  About
one-third  of all  sales  items  (including  related  work  in  process  and raw
materials) are valued on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Inventories of sales
items owned by foreign  subsidiaries  and inventories of operating  supplies and
parts are generally valued at average cost.
     Depreciation,  Amortization and Maintenance.  Depreciation and amortization
for  financial  reporting  purposes is provided  primarily on the  straight-line
method over the  estimated  useful  lives of the assets not  exceeding 40 years.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed; expenditures for renewals
and improvements are generally capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset,
the related cost and accumulated  depreciation or amortization  are removed from
the  accounts  and any gain or loss is  recognized.  In the event that facts and
circumstances   indicate   that  assets  may  be  impaired,   an  evaluation  of
recoverability would be performed.  If an evaluation is required,  the estimated
future  undiscounted  cash flows  associated with the asset would be compared to
the asset's  carrying  amount to determine  if a  write-down  to market value or
discounted cash flow value is required.
     Income Taxes. A valuation  allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not these items will either  expire before the Company is
able to realize their  benefit,  or that future  deductibility  is prohibited or
uncertain.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax  consequences  of events  that have been  realized  in the  financial
statements or tax returns.
     Derivative  Instruments.  The  Company  enters  into  derivative  financial
transactions  to hedge  existing or  projected  exposures  to  changing  foreign
exchange rates,  interest  rates,  security  prices,  or commodity  prices.  The
Company does not enter into derivative  transactions  for speculative  purposes.
Hedges of derivative financial  transactions are generally carried at fair value
with the resulting gains and losses reflected in the results of operations.


     Foreign Currency Translation. Foreign entities whose functional currency is
the U.S. dollar translate  monetary assets and liabilities at year-end  exchange
rates and  non-monetary  items are  translated at historical  rates.  Income and
expense  accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year,
except  for  depreciation  and cost of product  sales  which are  translated  at
historical rates.  Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are recognized
in  consolidated  income  in the  year of  occurrence.  Foreign  entities  whose
functional currency is the local currency translate net assets at year-end rates
and income and expense accounts at average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting
from these translations are reflected in the Shareholders' Equity section titled
"Cumulative translation adjustment".

Note 2.  Inventories
     About one-third of all sales items  (including  related work in process and
raw materials) are valued using the LIFO method.  If the average cost method had
been in use for inventories on the LIFO basis, total inventories would have been
about $18.3 million and $21.9 million  higher than reported at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.



Note 3. Property, Plant and Equipment


Note 4.  Related Companies
     The Company  conducts some of its operations  through various joint venture
and other partnership forms which are principally accounted for using the equity
method. Included in the Company's revenues for 1995, 1994 and 1993 are equity in
income of related  companies of $88.4 million,  $93.0 million and $76.3 million,
respectively.  When the  Company  sells or  transfers  assets  to an  affiliated
company that is accounted for using the equity method and the affiliated company
records  the  assets at fair  value,  the excess of the fair value of the assets
over the Company's  net book value is deferred and  amortized  over the expected
lives of the assets.  Deferred gains included in the Company's other liabilities
were  $10.1   million  and  $19.4   million  at  December  31,  1995  and  1994,
respectively.  Summarized  financial statements for European Marine Contractors,
Limited,  a 50% owned company which specializes in engineering,  procurement and
construction of marine pipelines,  and for the remaining  combined jointly owned
operations which are not consolidated are as follows:





Note 5.  Income Taxes
     The components of the (provision) benefit for income taxes are:



     Included in deferred  income taxes are foreign tax credits of $31.6 million
in 1995 and $18.4  million in 1994.  The U.S. and foreign  components  of income
(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests are
as follows:




     The primary components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities
and the related valuation allowances are as follows:


     The Company has foreign tax credits which expire in 2000 of $11.5  million.
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards which expire as follows:  1996,
$11.5 million;  1997, $19.3 million;  1998, $27.0 million;  1999, $30.2 million;
2000  through   2010,   $108.7   million;   and   indefinite,   $64.6   million.
Reconciliations between the actual benefit (provision) for income taxes and that
computed by applying the U.S.  statutory rate to income or loss from  continuing
operations before income taxes and minority interests are as follows:



     The Company has received statutory notices of deficiency for the 1989, 1990
and 1991 tax years from the Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) of $51.8  million,
$92.9  million and $16.8  million,  respectively,  excluding  any  penalties  or
interest.  The Company believes it has meritorious  defenses and does not expect
that any liability  resulting from the 1989,  1990 or 1991 tax years will result
in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position.
In 1993, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS for the 1980-1987 taxable
years.  As a result of the  settlement,  as well as  significant  prepayments of


taxes in prior years, the Company received a refund and net income was increased
by $40.4 million in 1993.

Note 6. Lines of Credit and Long-Term Debt



     The Company has  short-term  lines of credit  totaling  $125.0 million with
several U.S. banks.  No borrowings  were  outstanding at December 31, 1995 under
these credit facilities.  At December 31, 1995, $4.8 million of other short-term
debt was  outstanding.  The Company's 8.75%  debentures due February 15, 2021 do
not have sinking fund requirements and are not redeemable prior to maturity.  In
September  1995,  the  Company  redeemed  all of  the  zero  coupon  convertible
subordinated  debentures  due March 13, 2006 for $390.7  million in cash,  which
represents the original issue price plus accrued  original issue discount to the
redemption date. In addition,  in December 1995, the Company redeemed all of the
$42.0 million term loan.  The remaining  $23.8 million of the 10.2% sinking fund
debentures were redeemed in 1994.  Long-term debt of $5.2 million matures during
1996 and there are no maturities due for the succeeding four years.

Note 7.  Common Stock
     The Company's 1993 Stock and Long-Term  Incentive Plan (1993 Plan) provides
for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards: (1) stock options,
including  incentive stock options and  non-qualified  stock options;  (2) stock
appreciation  rights,  in  tandem  with  stock  options  or  freestanding;   (3)
restricted stock; (4) performance  share awards;  and (5) stock value equivalent
awards.  Under the terms of the 1993 Plan,  5.5 million  shares of the Company's
Common Stock were reserved for issuance to key employees.  At December 31, 1995,
2.0 million shares were available for future grants.  Stock option  transactions
are summarized as follows:



     All stock  options are granted at fair market  value of the Common Stock at
the grant date.  The weighted  average fair value of the stock  options  granted
during 1995 was $13.20.  The fair value of each stock  option grant is estimated
on the date of grant  using the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with the
following  weighted  average  assumptions  used for  grants  in 1995:  risk-free
interest rate of 6.22%;  expected dividend yield of 2.38%; expected life of five
years;  and expected  volatility of 32.11%.  Stock options  generally expire ten
years from the grant date or three years after date of  retirement,  if earlier.
Stock  options  vest over a three  year  period,  with  one-third  of the shares
becoming exercisable on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
The  outstanding  stock  options at December  31,  1995 have a weighted  average
contractual life of 8.92 years. The number of stock option shares exercisable at
December  31, 1995 was  745,744.  These stock  options  have a weighted  average
exercise price of $34.31 per share.
     The  Company  accounts  for the 1993  Plan in  accordance  with  Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25,  under which no  compensation  cost has been


recognized for stock option awards. Had compensation cost for the 1993 Plan been
determined  consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock - Based  Compensation" (SFAS 123), the Company's pro forma
net income and  earnings  per share for 1995 would have been $164.5  million and
$1.44,  respectively.  Because  the SFAS 123 method of  accounting  has not been
applied to options  granted  prior to January 1, 1995,  the  resulting pro forma
compensation  cost may not be  representative  of that to be  expected in future
years.
     Restricted  shares awarded under the 1993 Plan for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were
206,350,  80,600  and  107,000,  respectively.  The  shares  awarded  are net of
forfeitures  of 4,900 and  5,000  shares  in 1995 and  1994,  respectively.  The
weighted  average  fair  market  value  per share at the date of grant of shares
granted in 1995 was $40.88. The Company's Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors  (Restricted  Stock  Plan)  allows for each  non-employee  director to
receive an annual  award of 200  restricted  shares of Common Stock as a part of
compensation. The Company reserved 50,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to
non-employee  directors.  The Company issued 1,600 restricted shares in 1995 and
1,800  restricted  shares in both 1994 and 1993 under this  plan.  The  weighted
average  fair market  value per share at the date of grant of shares  granted in
1995 was $40.75.
     The  Company's  Employees'   Restricted  Stock  Plan  was  established  for
employees  who are not officers,  for which 100,000  shares of Common Stock have
been reserved.  The Company awarded 1,750 and 96,750  restricted  shares in 1995
and 1994,  respectively,  and 900 restricted  shares were forfeited in 1995. The
weighted  average  fair  market  value  per share at the date of grant of shares
granted in 1995 was $35.00.
     Under the terms of the Company's career executive incentive stock plan, 7.5
million  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock were  reserved  for issuance to
officers and key employees at a purchase  price not to exceed par value of $2.50
per share.  At December 31, 1995,  5.9 million shares (net of 1.0 million shares
forfeited)  have  been issued  under the plan.  No further grants will  be  made
under the career executive incentive stock plan.
     Restricted  shares  issued  under the 1993  Plan,  Restricted  Stock  Plan,
Employees'  Restricted Stock Plan and the career executive  incentive stock plan
are  limited  as  to  sale  or  disposition  with  such   restrictions   lapsing
periodically  over an  extended  period of time.  The fair  market  value of the
stock,  on the date of issuance,  is being amortized and charged to income (with
similar  credits to paid-in  capital in excess of par value)  generally over the
average  period  during  which  the  restrictions   lapse.   Compensation  costs
recognized  in income for 1995 was $7.0  million.  At  December  31,  1995,  the
unamortized amount is $23.9 million.

Note 8.  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
     In 1986,  the Company  declared a dividend of one preferred  stock purchase
right (a Right) on each outstanding  share of common stock,  terms of which were
subsequently modified as of February 15, 1990 and December 15, 1995 (the Amended
Rights  Agreement).  Pursuant to the Amended Rights  Agreement,  each Right will
entitle the holder thereof to buy one  one-hundredth of a share of the Company's
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, at an exercise
price of $150, subject to certain  antidilution  adjustments.  The Rights do not
have any voting rights and are not entitled to dividends.
     The Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances  involving a
potential business combination.  Following certain other events after the Rights
become  exercisable,  each Right will  entitle its holder to an amount of common
stock of the Company, or, in certain circumstances,  securities of the acquiror,
having a then-current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
The Rights are redeemable at the Company's option at any time before they become
exercisable.  The Rights  expire on December 15, 2005. No event during 1995 made
the Rights exercisable.

Note 9.  Business Segment Information
     The Company  operates in two segments - Energy Services and Engineering and
Construction  Services.  Energy Services' products and services include drilling
systems and services,  pressure  pumping  equipment  and  services,  logging and
perforating,  specialized  completion and production equipment and services, and
well  control.  Engineering  and  Construction  Services  provides  engineering,
construction,  project  management,  facilities  operation and maintenance,  and
environmental services for industrial and governmental customers.
     The Company's  equity in income or losses of related  companies is included
in  revenues  and  operating  income of each  applicable  segment.  Intersegment
revenues included in the revenues of the other business segments are immaterial.
Sales between geographic areas and export sales are also immaterial. General and
administrative  expenses were $157.8 million,  $182.0 million and $195.9 million
for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Depreciation
and amortization expenses were increased in 1993 by the loss for the sale of the
geophysical  business in 1994  discussed in Note 13 by $128.9  million.  General
corporate  assets are primarily  comprised of cash and  equivalents  and certain
other investments.






Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
     Leases. At December 31, 1995, the Company was obligated under noncancelable
operating leases,  expiring on various dates to 2108, principally for the use of
land,  offices,  equipment and field  facilities.  Aggregate  rentals charged to
operations  for such leases  totaled  $70.4 million in 1995,  $105.3  million in
1994,  and $130.8 million in 1993.  Future  aggregate  rentals on  noncancelable
operating leases are as follows: 1996, $50.3 million; 1997, $41.8 million; 1998,
$31.7 million; 1999, $23.0 million;  2000, $14.0 million; and thereafter,  $94.2
million.


     Environmental.  The Company is involved as a potentially  responsible party
(PRP) in  remedial  activities  to  clean up  various  "Superfund"  sites  under
applicable Federal law which imposes joint and several liability, if the harm is
indivisible,  on certain  persons  without regard to fault,  the legality of the
original  disposal,  or ownership of the site.  Although it is very difficult to
quantify the potential impact of compliance with environmental  protection laws,
management  of the Company  believes  that any  liability  of the  Company  with
respect to all but one of such sites will not have a material  adverse effect on
the  results of  operations  of the  Company.  With  respect to a site in Jasper
County,  Missouri (Jasper County Superfund Site), sufficient information has not
been developed to permit  management to make such a determination and management
believes the process of determining the nature and extent of remediation at this
site and the total costs thereof will be lengthy.  Brown & Root,  Inc.  (Brown &
Root), a subsidiary of the Company,  has been named as a PRP with respect to the
Jasper County Superfund Site by the  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). The
Jasper County  Superfund  Site includes  areas of mining  activity that occurred
from the 1800's through the mid 1950's in the southwestern  portion of Missouri.
The site  contains lead and zinc mine  tailings  produced from mining  activity.
Brown & Root is one of nine  participating  PRPs which have  agreed to perform a
Remedial  Investigation/Feasibility  Study (RI/FS),  which is not expected to be
completed  until the third  quarter of 1996.  Although the entire  Jasper County
Superfund Site  comprises 237 square miles as listed on the National  Priorities
List, in the RI/FS scope of work, the EPA has only  identified  seven areas,  or
subsites,  within this area that need to be studied and then possibly remediated
by the PRPs.  Additionally,  the  Administrative  Order on Consent for the RI/FS
only requires  Brown & Root to perform RI/FS work at one of the subsites  within
the site, the Neck/Alba subsite, which only comprises 3.95 square miles. Brown &
Root's share of the cost of such a study is not expected to be material.  At the
present time Brown & Root cannot determine the extent of its liability,  if any,
for remediation costs on any reasonably practicable basis.
     Other.  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal
proceedings.  Although the ultimate  dispositions  of such  proceedings  are not
presently  determinable,  in the opinion of the Company any  liability  that may
ensue will not be material in relation to the  consolidated  financial  position
and results of operations of the Company.

Note 11.  Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration
     Foreign  Exchange Risk. The Company  operates in over 100 countries  around
the world and has exposures to currency fluctuations in approximately 80 foreign
currencies.  These  exposures  subject the Company to the risk that the eventual
dollar net cash flows from sales to customers and purchases from suppliers could
be  adversely  affected  by changes in  exchange  rates.  Some  currencies  have
established  markets  that  facilitate  the active  exchange of one currency for
another (traded  currencies),  but most currencies are not widely traded and are
actively controlled by their respective governments (non-traded currencies).  It
is the  Company's  policy to hedge  significant  exposures to potential  foreign
exchange  losses  considering   current  market  conditions,   future  operating
activities  and the cost of hedging the  exposure  in relation to the  perceived
risk of loss.  Techniques in managing foreign exchange risk include, but are not
limited  to,  foreign  currency  borrowing,  investing,  and the use of currency
derivative  instruments.  Foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
are not permitted.
     Market  Risk.  As part of the  Company's  efforts to  minimize  market risk
associated with foreign currency  exchange rate  volatility,  the Company hedges
its  exposure  in  traded  currencies  through  the use of  currency  derivative
instruments,  specifically,  forward  exchange  contracts  and foreign  exchange
option contracts.  Such contracts  generally have an expiration date of one year
or less.  Forward  exchange  contracts  (commitments  to buy or sell a specified
amount of a foreign  currency at a specified  price and time) are generally used
to hedge  identifiable  foreign  currency  commitments.  Gains or losses on such
contracts are deferred and recognized  when the offsetting  gains and losses are
recognized on the related hedged items. Foreign exchange option contracts (which
convey the right,  but not the obligation,  to sell or buy a specified amount of
foreign  currency  at a specified  price) are  generally  used to hedge  foreign
currency  commitments  with an  indeterminable  maturity  date.  The use of some
contracts may limit the Company's ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates.  Forward and option contracts associated with foreign
currency commitments having  indeterminable  maturity dates are marked to market
monthly with the resulting  gains or losses  included in current  period income.
While  hedging   instruments  are  subject  to   fluctuations  in  value,   such
fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being
hedged.  The  forward or option  contracts  utilized  are all  purchased  from a
selected  group of highly rated banks.  None of the forward or option  contracts
are exchange  traded.  At December 31, 1995,  the Company held foreign  currency
forward contracts with net notional amounts totaling $12.4 million, in which the
Company was the buyer of $3.4 million and the seller of $15.8 million of foreign
currencies,  and foreign  currency  option  contracts with net notional  amounts
totaling  $54.1  million in which the Company was the buyer of $18.1 million and
the seller of $72.2  million of foreign  currencies.  At December 31, 1994,  the
Company held  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  with net  notional  amounts
totaling $11.8  million,  in which the Company was the buyer of $5.1 million and
the seller of $16.9 million of foreign  currencies,  and foreign currency option
contracts with net notional amounts totaling $12.2 million, in which the Company
was the buyer of $26.0  million  and the  seller  of $38.2  million  of  foreign
currencies.  The Company actively  monitors its foreign  currency  exposure (net


position)  and  adjusts  the  amounts  hedged as  appropriate.  The table  below
summarizes   the  Company's  net  assets   (liabilities)   exposed  to  currency
fluctuations  at December  31,  1995,  in traded  (other  than U.S.  dollar) and
non-traded foreign currencies as well as the net notional amounts of the related
hedging contracts held.

     Exposures to non-traded  currencies  are generally not hedged due primarily
to lack of available  markets or cost  considerations.  The Company  attempts to
manage its working capital position to minimize foreign currency  commitments in
non-traded  currencies and recognizes that pricing for the services and products
offered in such countries  should cover the cost of exchange rate  devaluations.
The  Company  has  historically   incurred   transaction  losses  in  non-traded
currencies.  The risk of loss is  primarily  due to the  magnitude  of  currency
devaluations experienced in those currencies rather than the size of the foreign
currency  exposures.  Net assets subject to currency exposure resulting from the
use of  functional  currencies  other  than the U.S.  dollar  in which  exchange
movements affect  shareholders' equity were $143.0 million in 1995.
     Credit Risk. Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations  of credit risk are primarily cash  equivalents,  investments and
trade  receivables.  It is the Company's  practice to place its cash equivalents
and investments in high quality securities with various investment institutions.
The Company  derives the  majority of its  revenues  from sales and services to,
including  engineering and  construction  for, the energy  industry.  Within the
energy industry,  trade receivables are generated from a broad and diverse group
of customers.  There are  concentrations of receivables in the United States and
the United Kingdom. The Company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the
expected  collectibility of all trade accounts receivable.  The notional amounts
of the Company's foreign exchange  contracts do not generally  represent amounts
exchanged  by the  parties,  and thus,  are not a measure of the exposure of the
Company or of the cash  requirements  relating  to these  contracts.  The credit
exposure of the Company on foreign  exchange  contracts  is  represented  by the
carrying  amount of such contracts.  Counterparties  are selected by the Company
based on creditworthiness,  which the Company continually  monitors,  and on the
counterparties'  ability to  perform  their  obligations  under the terms of the
transactions.  There are no significant  concentrations  of credit risk with any
individual  counterparty  or groups of  counterparties  related to the Company's
derivative contracts.  The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to
meet their  obligations  under these  contracts  given their high credit ratings
and, as such, considers the credit risk associated with its derivative contracts
to be minimal.
     Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The estimated fair value of long-term
debt at  December  31,  1995 and 1994 was $247.9  million  and  $626.1  million,
respectively,  as compared to the carrying  amount of $200.0  million and $643.1
million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The fair value of long-term
debt is based on quoted  market  prices  for those or similar  instruments.  The
carrying  amount of  short-term  financial  instruments  (cash and  equivalents,
receivables,  and certain other  liabilities)  as reflected in the  consolidated
balance  sheets  approximates  fair value due to the short  maturities  of these
instruments. The fair value of currency derivative instruments,  which generally
approximates  the  carrying  amount,  was less than $2.5 million at December 31,
1995 and 1994.

Note 12.  Retirement Plans
     Retirement  Plans.  The Company has various  retirement plans which cover a
significant  number of its  employees.  The  major  pension  plans  are  defined
contribution  plans,  which  provide  pension  benefits  in return for  services
rendered,  provide an individual  account for each  participant,  and have terms
that specify how contributions to the participant's account are to be determined
rather  than the amount of  pension  benefits  the  participant  is to  receive.
Contributions  to these plans are based on pre-tax  income and/or  discretionary
amounts  determined  on an annual basis.  The Company's  expense for the defined
contribution  plans  totaled $94.2  million,  $98.0 million and $54.6 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Other pension plans include defined benefit
plans,  which define an amount of pension  benefit to be provided,  usually as a
function of one or more factors such as age, years of service,  or compensation.
As a result of the sizable  reduction  in the number of  employees,  curtailment
gains of $1.3 million and $8.9 million are reflected in the net amortization and
deferral component of net periodic pension cost for 1995 and 1994, respectively.
  


These  plans are  funded to  operate  on an  actuarially  sound  basis.  Assumed
long-term rates of return on plan assets,  discount rates in estimating  benefit
obligations  and rates of  compensation  increases vary for the different  plans
according to the local economic  conditions.  Plan assets are primarily invested
in equity and fixed income  securities  of entities  domiciled in the country of
the plan's operation. The rates used are as follows:




     The net periodic pension cost for defined benefit plans is as follows:


     The  reconciliation  of the funded  status for defined  benefit plans where
assets exceed accumulated benefits is as follows:




     The  reconciliation  of the funded  status for defined  benefit plans where
accumulated benefits exceed assets is as follows:



     Postretirement  Medical Plan. The Company offers a  postretirement  medical
plan to certain  employees that qualify for  retirement  and, on the last day of
active employment, are enrolled as participants in the Company's active employee
medical plan. The Company's  liability is limited to a fixed contribution amount
for each participant or dependent.  Effective in September 1993,  coverage under
this  plan  ceases  when  the  participant   reaches  age  65.  However,   those
participants  aged 65 or over on January 1, 1994, have the option to participate
in an expanded  prescription drug program in lieu of the medical  coverage.  The
plan participants share the total cost for all benefits provided above the fixed
Company contribution and participants' contributions are adjusted as required to
cover benefit payments.  The Company has made no commitment to adjust the amount
of its contributions; therefore, the computed accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation  amount  is not  affected  by the  expected  future  healthcare  cost
inflation  rate.  The weighted  average  discount rate used in  determining  the
accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation was 7% in 1995, 8% in 1994 and 7%
in 1993.

     Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following components:


     Non-pension   postretirement  benefits  are  funded  by  the  Company  when
incurred.  The Company's  postretirement medical plan's funded status reconciled
with the  amounts  included  in the  Company's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 is as follows:



Note 13.  Acquisitions and Dispositions
     See Note 14 as to the disposition of the Company's insurance segment.
     The Company sold its natural gas compression business unit in November 1994
for  $205.0  million  in cash.  The sale  resulted  in a pretax  gain of  $102.0


million,  or 56 cents per  share  after  tax.  The  business  unit sold owns and
operates a large  natural gas  compressor  rental fleet in the United States and
Canada. The compressors are used to assist in the production, transportation and
storage of natural gas.
     In January 1994,  the Company sold  substantially  all of the assets of its
geophysical  services and products business to Western Atlas  International Inc.
for $190.0 million in cash and notes subject to certain  adjustments.  The notes
of $90.0  million were sold for cash in the first  quarter of 1994. In addition,
the Company  issued $73.8 million in notes to Western Atlas to cover some of the
costs  of  reducing  certain  geophysical  operations,  including  the  cost  of
personnel  reductions,  leases of geophysical  marine vessels and the closing of
duplicate facilities.  The Company's notes to Western Atlas are payable over two
years at a rate of interest of 4%. An initial  installment  of $33.8 million was
made in February 1994, and quarterly installments of $5.0 million have been made
thereafter. The Company recognized a $301.8 million charge ($263.8 million after
tax) in 1993  related  to the  sale of its  geophysical  business.  This  charge
includes  $120.7  million  for the  write-down  to the net  realizable  value of
equipment and other assets; $54.0 million for anticipated operating and contract
losses through the dates of disposition or completion;  $43.4 million for marine
vessel leases and mobilization;  $35.1 million for facility leases and closures;
$34.4  million for  personnel and  severance;  and $14.2 million for  transition
costs and other  related  matters.  Services and products  provided  through the
geophysical  business  include  seismic  data  collection  and  data  processing
services  for  both  land  and  marine   seismic   exploration   activities  and
manufacturing and sales of seismic equipment.  The revenues,  operating loss and
net loss of the  geophysical  operations,  excluding  the  charge in 1993,  were
$404.4 million, $20.1 million, and $20.3 million, respectively.
     In March 1993,  the  Company  acquired  the assets of Smith  International,
Inc.'s  Directional  Drilling Systems and Services business for 6,857,000 shares
of Halliburton Company Common Stock previously held as treasury stock, valued at
approximately  $247 million.  The Company  recorded  $135.8 million as excess of
cost over net assets acquired.  The excess of cost over net assets acquired will
be amortized over 40 years.

Note 14. Discontinued Operations
     On January 23,  1996,  the  Company  spun-off  its  property  and  casualty
insurance  subsidiary,  Highlands  Insurance Group,  Inc. (HIGI),  in a tax-free
distribution  to  holders of  Halliburton  Company  common  stock.  Each  common
shareholder of the Company  received one share of common stock of HIGI for every
ten shares of  Halliburton  Company  common  stock.  Approximately  11.4 million
common shares of HIGI were issued in conjunction with the spin-off.
     After the spin-off  transaction,  HIGI issued $62.9 million of  convertible
subordinated  debentures  due December 31, 2005 with  detachable  Series A and B
Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrants to  Insurance  Partners,  L.P.  and  Insurance
Partners  Offshore  (Bermuda),   L.P.  (IP)  and  to  certain  members  of  HIGI
management.
     The convertible  subordinated debentures issued are convertible into common
stock of HIGI after one year from  issuance at the option of the  holders.  HIGI
can redeem the debentures at any time after December 31, 2002. The holders would
receive approximately 3.9 million shares of HIGI, or approximately 25% ownership
interest in HIGI, if all of the  debentures  are converted  into common stock of
HIGI at a conversion  price of $16.16 per share.  Interest on the  debentures is
payable semiannually in cash at 10% per annum.
     The detachable  Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrants (Series A Warrants)
enable the holders to purchase HIGI common stock at an exercise  price of $14.69
per share, equal to an additional  ownership interest of approximately 21% after
giving effect to the assumed  conversion of the  debentures  and the exercise of
the Series A Warrants. If all of the Series A Warrants were exercised,  IP would
receive  approximately  4.0 million  shares of HIGI.  The exercise price and the
number of shares of HIGI  common  stock into  which the  Series A  Warrants  are
exercisable  will be  subject to  adjustment  in  certain  circumstances.  These
warrants expire on December 31, 2005.
     The detachable  Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrants (Series B Warrants)
enable the holders to purchase  shares of HIGI common stock at an exercise price
of $14.69,  equal to an additional  ownership interest of 5% after giving effect
to the assumed conversion of the debentures and the exercise of the Series A and
B Warrants. The Series B Warrants become exercisable by the holders in the event
that the average  closing  market price of HIGI common stock  exceeds 1.61 times
the  exercise  price for any 30  consecutive  trading days prior to December 31,
2000  but  after  December  31,  1998.  If all of the  Series  B  Warrants  were
exercised, the holders would receive approximately 1.0 million additional shares
of HIGI.  The exercise  price and the number of shares of HIGI common stock into
which the Series A Warrants are  exercisable  will be subject to  adjustment  in
certain  circumstances.  The detachable Series B Warrants expire on December 31,
2005.
     If the  debentures are converted into common stock of HIGI and the Series A
and B Warrants are utilized by the holders to purchase common stock of HIGI, the
holders will own approximately 44% of HIGI.


     The following summarizes the results of operations and consolidated balance
sheets of the discontinued operations. Such amounts are summarized as follows:





    In the third quarter of 1995, HIGI conducted an extensive review of its loss
and loss  adjustment  expense  reserves to assess HIGI's reserve  position.  The
review  process  consisted  of gathering  new  information  and  refining  prior
estimates and primarily focused on assumed reinsurance and overall environmental
and asbestos exposure.  As a result of such review,  HIGI increased its reserves
for loss and loss adjustment  expenses and certain legal matters and the Company
also recognized the estimated  expenses related to the spin-off  transaction and
additional compensation costs and other regulatory and legal provisions directly
associated  with  discontinuing  the  insurance  services  business  segment  as
follows:



     The review of the insurance  policies and reinsurance  agreements was based
upon a recent actuarial study and HIGI  management's  best estimates using facts
and trends currently known,  taking into  consideration the current  legislative
and legal  environment.  Developed  case law and adequate  claim  history do not
exist for such  claims.  Estimates  of the  liability  are  reviewed and updated


continually.  Due to the  significant  uncertainties  related to these  types of
claims,  past  claim  experience  may  not be  representative  of  future  claim
experience.
     The Company  also  realized a valuation  allowance  for deferred tax assets
primarily  related to HIGI's  insurance  claim loss  reserves.  The  Company had
provided a valuation  allowance  for all temporary  differences  related to HIGI
based upon its intent announced in 1992 that it was pursuing the sale of HIGI. A
taxable  transaction  would have made it more  likely  than not that the related
benefit or future deductibility would not be realized.  The spin-off transaction
was  tax-free  and  allows  HIGI to  retain  its tax  basis and the value of its
deferred tax asset.

To the Board of Directors
European Marine Contractors Limited

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of European Marine
Contractors  Limited  as  of  December  31,  1995  and  1994,  and  the  related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  total  recognised  gains and  losses  and
cashflows for the each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audit.



We conducted our audits in accordance  with United  Kingdom  auditing  standards
which do not differ in any  significant  respect  from United  States  generally
accepted  auditing  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurances about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates made by the  management,  as well as evaluating the overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.



In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of
European  Marine  Contractors  Limited at December  31,  1995 and 1994,  and the
consolidated  results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period  ended  December  31,  1995 in  conformity  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom

1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Accounting Convention

     The financial  statements are prepared under the historical cost convention
     as modified  to include  the  revaluation  of certain  fixed  assets and in
     accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.

     Basis of Consolidation

     The group  financial  statements  consolidate  the financial  statements of
     European  Marine  Contractors  Limited and EMC  Nederland BV drawn up to 31
     December each year.

     Joint Ventures

     The  company's  share of the results of  unincorporated  joint  ventures is
     proportionally  consolidated  in the  group  profit  and loss  account  and
     balance sheet.

     Goodwill

     Purchased  goodwill is  amortised  through the profit and loss account over
     the directors' original estimate of its useful life.

     Depreciation

     Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less the
     expected  residual value of each fixed asset over its expected  useful life
     as follows:

      Marine floating equipment - at 25% per annum   on a reducing balance basis
      Buildings and leasehold
        improvements            - over 3-15 years    on a straight line basis
      Plant & Machinery:-
         Other marine equipment - over 2-5 years     on a straight line basis
         Office equipment       - over 4-5 years     on a straight line basis

     Depreciation  on assets  under  construction  is  provided  when assets are
     partially brought into use during the year, at the appropriate rate above.

     Equipment Maintenance

     The marine floating equipment is dry-docked for major repairs in accordance
     with statutory  requirements.  Other maintenance works are carried out on a
     yearly basis.  Provisions  towards  meeting both these costs are being made
     each year  based on an  estimate  of costs to be  incurred  and the  future
     utilisation programmes.

     Stocks

     Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

     Foreign Currency

     The financial statements of consolidated undertakings are translated at the
     rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.

     The exchange  adjustments  arising on re-translating the opening net assets
     are taken directly to reserves.

     Operating Leases

     Rentals paid in respect of  operating  leases are charged to the profit and
     loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

     Pensions

     Pension scheme  contributions  are made in accordance with actuarial advice
     and are charged to the profit and loss  account so as to spread the pension
     cost over the anticipated period of service of scheme members.

     Government Grants

     Government Grants on capital expenditure are credited to a deferral account
     and are released to revenue  over the expected  useful life of the relevant
     asset by equal annual amounts.

     Long Term Contracts

     Profit on long term  contracts  is taken as the work is carried  out if the
     final  outcome  can be  assessed  with  reasonable  certainty.  The  profit
     included is  calculated  on a basis to reflect the  proportion  of the work
     carried out at the year end, by  recording  turnover  and related  costs as
     contract activity progresses.  Turnover is calculated on that proportion of
     total  contract  value which costs  incurred to date bear to total expected
     costs for that contract.  Revenues derived from variations on contracts are
     recognised  only  when  they  have  been  accepted  by the  customer.  Full
     provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are
     first foreseen.

     Deferred Taxation

     Deferred  taxation is  provided  under the  liability  method on all timing
     differences  which are  expected  to reverse in the  future  without  being
     replaced,  calculated at the rate at which it is estimated that tax will be
     payable.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  only  where  recovery  is
     reasonably certain.

2    TURNOVER

     Turnover  comprises  that part of each contract  value  represented by work
     completed at the balance sheet date. Turnover excludes applicable VAT.

     The net assets of the group are substantially  located in the North Sea and
