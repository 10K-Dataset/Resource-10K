Description of business

Halliburton Company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. Its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1924. Inspired by the past and leading into the future, what started with a single product from a single location is now a global enterprise. We are proud of our over 100 years of operation, innovation, collaboration, and execution. Halliburton has fostered a culture of unparalleled service to the world's major, national and independent oil and gas producers. With approximately

55,000

employees, representing 140 nationalities in more than


countries, we help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset.

2019 Highlights

Item 1 | Business

Business strategy

Our value proposition is to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We strive to achieve superior growth and returns for our shareholders by delivering technology and services that improve efficiency, increase recovery and maximize production for our customers. Our objectives are to:

-

create a balanced portfolio of services and products supported by global infrastructure and anchored by technological innovation to further differentiate our company;

-

reach a distinguished level of operational excellence that reduces costs and creates real value;

-

preserve a dynamic workforce by being a preferred employer to attract, develop and retain the best global talent; and

-

maintain the highest ethical and business standards and health, safety and environmental performance.

For further discussion on our business strategies, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Executive Overview."

Markets and competition

We are one of the world’s largest diversified energy services companies. Our services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and products include: price; service delivery; health, safety and environmental standards and practices; service quality; global talent retention; understanding the geological characteristics of the hydrocarbon reservoir; product quality; warranty; and technical proficiency.

We conduct business worldwide in more than


countries. The business operations of our divisions are organized around four primary geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East/Asia. In


,


and


, based on the location of services provided and products sold,

51%

,

58%

and

53%

, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during these periods. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about our geographic operations. Because the markets for our services and products are vast and cross numerous geographic lines, it is not practicable to provide a meaningful estimate of the total number of our competitors. The industries we serve are highly competitive, and we have many substantial competitors. Most of our services and products are marketed through our service and sales organizations.

The following charts depict the company's revenue split between its four primary geographic regions for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


.

Operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, health or similar issues, sanctions, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. We believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that loss of operations in any one country, other than the United States, would be materially adverse to our business, consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition.

Information regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration and financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Instrument Market Risk” and in

Note 15

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1 | Business

Customers

Our revenue during the past three years was derived from the sale of services and products to the energy industry. No single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in any period presented.

Raw materials

Raw materials essential to our business are normally readily available. Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, such as proppants (primarily sand), hydrochloric acid and gels, including guar gum (a blending additive used in hydraulic fracturing). We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials. Our procurement department uses our size and buying power to enhance our access to key materials at competitive prices.

Patents

We own a large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent applications covering various products and processes. We are also licensed to utilize technology covered by patents owned by others, and we license others to utilize technology covered by our patents. We do not consider any particular patent to be material to our business operations.

Seasonality

Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services, but the widespread geographical locations of our operations mitigate those effects. Examples of how weather can impact our business include:

-

the severity and duration of the winter in North America can have a significant impact on natural gas storage levels and drilling activity;

-

the timing and duration of the spring thaw in Canada directly affects activity levels due to road restrictions;

-

typhoons and hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations; and

-

severe weather during the winter normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia.

Additionally, customer spending patterns for software, completion tools and various other oilfield services and products typically result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year. Conversely, customer spending patterns and budget constraints may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the second half of the year.

Employees

At

December 31, 2019

, we employed approximately

55,000

people worldwide compared to approximately

60,000

at

December 31, 2018

. At

December 31, 2019

, approximately

15%

of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Based upon the geographic diversification of these employees, we do not believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.

Environmental regulation

We are subject to numerous environmental, legal and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide. For further information related to environmental matters and regulation, see

Note 10

to the consolidated financial statements and "Item 1(a). Risk Factors.”

Hydraulic fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates fractures extending from the well bore into the rock formation to enable natural gas or oil to move more easily from the rock pores to a production conduit. A significant portion of our Completion and Production segment provides hydraulic fracturing services to customers developing shale natural gas and shale oil. From time to time, questions arise about the scope of our operations in the shale natural gas and shale oil sectors, and the extent to which these operations may affect human health and the environment.

At the direction of our customer, we design and generally implement a hydraulic fracturing operation to 'stimulate' the well's production, once the well has been drilled, cased and cemented. Our customer is generally responsible for providing the base fluid (usually water) used in the hydraulic fracturing of a well. We frequently supply the proppant (primarily sand) and at least a portion of the additives used in the overall fracturing fluid mixture. In addition, we mix the additives and proppant with the base fluid and pump the mixture down the wellbore to create the desired fractures in the target formation. The customer is responsible for disposing and/or recycling for further use any materials that are subsequently produced or pumped out of the well, including flowback fluids and produced water.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1 | Business

As part of the process of constructing the well, the customer will take a number of steps designed to protect drinking water resources. In particular, the casing and cementing of the well are designed to provide 'zonal isolation' so that the fluids pumped down the wellbore and the oil and natural gas and other materials that are subsequently pumped out of the well will not come into contact with shallow aquifers or other shallow formations through which those materials could potentially migrate to freshwater aquifers or the surface.

The potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing have been studied by numerous government entities and others. In 2004, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an extensive study of hydraulic fracturing practices, focusing on coalbed methane wells, and their potential effect on underground sources of drinking water. The EPA’s study concluded that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells poses little or no threat to underground sources of drinking water. In December 2016, the EPA released a final report, “

Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States

” representing the culmination of a six-year study requested by Congress. While the EPA report noted a potential for some impact to drinking water sources caused by hydraulic fracturing, the agency confirmed the overall incidence of impacts is low. Moreover, a number of the areas of potential impact identified in the report involve activities for which we are not generally responsible, such as potential impacts associated with withdrawals of surface water for use as a base fluid and management of wastewater.

We have proactively developed processes to provide our customers with the chemical constituents of our hydraulic fracturing fluids to enable our customers to comply with state laws as well as voluntary standards established by the Chemical Disclosure Registry,

www.fracfocus.org

. We have also invested considerable resources in developing hydraulic fracturing technologies, in both the equipment and chemistry portions of our business, which offer our customers a variety of environment-friendly options related to the use of hydraulic fracturing fluid additives and other aspects of our hydraulic fracturing operations. We created a hydraulic fracturing fluid system comprised of materials sourced entirely from the food industry. In addition, we have engineered a process that uses ultraviolet light to control the growth of bacteria in hydraulic fracturing fluids, allowing customers to minimize the use of chemical biocides. We are committed to the continued development of innovative chemical and mechanical technologies that allow for more economical and environment-friendly development of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves, and that reduce noise while complying with Tier 4 lower emission legislation.

In evaluating any environmental risks that may be associated with our hydraulic fracturing services, it is helpful to understand the role that we play in the development of shale natural gas and shale oil. Our principal task generally is to manage the process of injecting fracturing fluids into the borehole to 'stimulate' the well. Thus, based on the provisions in our contracts and applicable law, the primary environmental risks we face are potential pre-injection spills or releases of stored fracturing fluids and potential spills or releases of fuel or other fluids associated with pumps, blenders, conveyors, or other above-ground equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process.

Although possible concerns have been raised about hydraulic fracturing, the circumstances described above have helped to mitigate those concerns. To date, we have not been obligated to compensate any indemnified party for any environmental liability arising directly from hydraulic fracturing, although there can be no assurance that such obligations or liabilities will not arise in the future.  For further information on risks related to hydraulic fracturing, see "Item 1(a). Risk Factors.”

Working capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and equivalents, short-term investments and cash flow generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs.

Item 1(a).

Risk Factors

.

When considering an investment in Halliburton Company, all of the risk factors described below and other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report should be carefully considered. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Demand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can cause them to reduce or defer major expenditures. We also have a small number of integrated projects that have remuneration tied to hydrocarbon production. Reduction in oil and gas prices can affect the overall returns for these projects, either lengthening the time until the expected returns are realized or by impairing the value of the asset. Any prolonged reductions of commodity prices or expectations of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, and could result in asset impairments and severance costs.

Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:

-

the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;

-

the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain oil production levels;

-

the level of oil production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC countries;

-

oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;

-

the cost of, and constraints associated with, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;

-

governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;

-

weather conditions, natural disasters and health or similar issues, such as pandemics or epidemics;

-

worldwide political, military and economic conditions; and

-

increased demand for alternative energy and electric vehicles, including government initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas.

Our business is dependent on capital spending by our customers, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our business is directly affected by changes in capital expenditures by our customers, and reductions in their capital spending could reduce demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Some of the items that may impact our customer's capital spending include:

-

oil and natural gas prices, including volatility of oil and natural gas prices and expectations regarding future prices;

-

the inability of our customers to access capital on economically advantageous terms, which may be impacted by, among other things, a decrease of investors' interest in hydrocarbon producers because of environmental and sustainability initiatives;

-

changes in customers' capital allocation, leading to less focus on growth;

-

restrictions on our customers' ability to get their produced oil and natural gas to market due to infrastructure limitations;

-

the consolidation of our customers;

-

customer personnel changes; and

-

adverse developments in the business or operations of our customers, including write-downs of oil and natural gas reserves and borrowing base reductions under customer credit facilities.

Any significant reduction in commodity prices or a change in our customers’ expectations of commodity prices, economic growth or supply and demand for oil and natural gas may result in capital budget reductions in the future. Any

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

substantial and unexpected drop in commodity prices in the future, even if the drop is relatively short-lived, could similarly affect our customers’ expectations and capital spending, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that

could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:

-

political and economic instability, including:

•

civil unrest, acts of terrorism, war and other armed conflict;

•

inflation; and

•

currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions; and

-

governmental actions that may:

•

result in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;

•

result in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;

•

limit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;

•

impose sanctions on our ability to conduct business with certain customers or persons;

•

result in the deprivation of contract rights; and

•

result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.

For example, due to the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries, our operations, revenue and profits are subject to the adverse consequences of war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, currency controls and governmental actions. These and other risks described above could result in the loss of our personnel or assets, cause us to evacuate our personnel from certain countries, cause us to increase spending on security worldwide, cause us to cease operating in certain countries, disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Areas where we operate that have significant risk include, but are not limited to: the Middle East, North Africa, Angola, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia and Venezuela. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our operations are subject to cyberattacks that

could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. Examples of these digital technologies include analytics, automation, and cloud services. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. We routinely monitor our systems for cyber threats and have processes in place to detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we have experienced occasional cyberattacks and attempted breaches over the past year, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections. We detected and remediated all of these incidents. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on our business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. No known leakage of material financial, technical or customer data occurred as a result of cyberattacks against us and none of the incidents mentioned above had a material adverse effect on our business, operations, reputation, or consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition.

If our systems, or our business associates' systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; interruption of our business operations; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our business associates, employees and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

Our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits United States companies and their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, agents, or joint venture partners that could be in violation of anti-corruption laws, even though some of these parties are not subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. We are also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws. Allegations of violations of applicable anti-corruption laws have resulted and may in the future result in internal, independent, or government investigations. Violations of anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

In addition, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. During 2014, the United States and European Union imposed sectoral sanctions directed at Russia’s oil and gas industry. Among other things, these sanctions restrict the provision of U.S. and EU goods, services and technology in support of exploration or production for deep water, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil in Russia. These sanctions resulted in our winding down and ending work on two projects in Russia in 2014, and have prevented us from pursuing certain other projects in Russia. In 2017 and 2018, the U.S. Government imposed additional sanctions against Russia, Russia’s oil and gas industry and certain Russian companies. Our ability to engage in certain future projects in Russia or involving certain Russian customers is dependent upon whether or not our involvement in such projects is restricted under U.S. or EU sanctions laws and the extent to which any of our current or prospective operations in Russia or with certain Russian customers may be subject to those laws. Those laws may change from time to time, and any expansion of sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas industry could further hinder our ability to do business in Russia or with certain Russian customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

In 2017, the U.S. Government announced sanctions directed at certain Venezuelan individuals and imposed additional economic sanctions around certain categories of trade financing transactions in Venezuela. In the first quarter of 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued additional guidance on these sanctions which purports to prohibit the acceptance of payments on receivables issued on or after August 25, 2017 and outstanding longer than 90 days from customers subject to U.S. sanctions related to Venezuela in the absence of an OFAC license. During the first quarter of 2018, we wrote down all of our remaining investment in Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, OFAC issued additional sanctions targeting the Venezuela energy sector and granted a general license to us to continue our operations in Venezuela, subject to previously issued OFAC sanctions. This general license

was set to expire on July 27, 2019, but has been extended several times and is now set to expire on April 22, 2020

. We are continuing our limited operations in Venezuela pursuant to this general license and continuing to evaluate our operations in advance of the April 22, 2020 termination of the general license.

The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. In addition, investigations by governmental authorities and legal, social, economic and political issues in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

Changes in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with laws in the countries in which we conduct business may negatively impact our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to and transfer personnel or equipment among some of those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.

In the countries in which we conduct business, we are subject to multiple and, at times, inconsistent regulatory regimes, including those that govern our use of radioactive materials, explosives and chemicals in the course of our operations. Various national and international regulatory regimes govern the shipment of these items. Many countries, but not all, impose special controls upon the export and import of radioactive materials, explosives and chemicals. Our ability to do business is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these multiple regulatory requirements applicable to these special products. In addition, the various laws governing import and export of both products and technology apply to a wide range of services and products we offer. In turn, this can affect our employment practices of hiring people of different nationalities because these laws may prohibit or limit access to some products or technology by employees of various nationalities. Changes in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with these laws may negatively impact our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to and transfer personnel or equipment among some of the countries in which we operate and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.

The adoption of any future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Various federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as actions in other countries, have been or could be undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in many U.S. states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that generally include protections for proprietary information. Legislation, regulations and/or policies have also been adopted at the state level that impose other types of requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations (such as limits on operations in the event of certain levels of seismic activity).  Additional legislation and/or regulations have been adopted or are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations. Four states (New York, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington) have banned the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing, Oregon has adopted a five-year moratorium, and Colorado has enacted legislation providing local governments with regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing operations. Local jurisdictions in some states have adopted ordinances that restrict or in certain cases prohibit the use of hydraulic fracturing, although many of these ordinances have been challenged and some have been overturned.

In addition, governmental authorities in various foreign countries where we have provided or may provide hydraulic fracturing services have imposed or are considering imposing various restrictions or conditions that may affect hydraulic fracturing operations.

The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Liabilities arising out of well incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Events can occur at well sites where we conduct our operations, including blowouts potentially resulting in explosions, fires, personal injuries, property damage, pollution and potential legal responsibility. For example, a well where we provided services in Indonesian waters experienced a well control issue in July 2019, which resulted in hydrocarbons being released into the water surrounding the well site. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases and limitations on liability with our customers, and liability insurance coverage, to protect us from potential liability related to such occurrences, and, although no claim has been asserted against us, we expect we would do so with respect to the event in Indonesia. However, we do not have these contractual provisions in all contracts, and even where we do, it is possible that the respective customer or insurer could seek to avoid or be financially unable to meet its obligations or a court may decline to enforce such provisions. Damages that are not indemnified or released could greatly exceed available insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the United States and the other countries where we do business. We evaluate and address the environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties in order to avoid future liabilities and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, claims have been made against us under environmental laws and regulations. In the United States, environmental laws and regulations

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

typically impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties. We are periodically notified of potential liabilities at federal and state superfund sites. These potential liabilities may arise from both historical Halliburton operations and the historical operations of companies that we have acquired. Our exposure at these sites may be materially impacted by unforeseen adverse developments both in the final remediation costs and with respect to the final allocation among the various parties involved at the sites. The relevant regulatory agency may bring suit against us for amounts in excess of what we have accrued and what we believe is our proportionate share of remediation costs at any superfund site. We also could be subject to third-party claims, including punitive damages, with respect to environmental matters for which we have been named as a potentially responsible party. Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws or related third-party claims could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Failure on our part to comply with, and the costs of compliance with, applicable health, safety and environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

In addition to the numerous environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to health and safety. Among those laws and regulations are those covering hazardous materials and requiring emission performance standards for facilities. For example, our well service operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances. We also store, transport and use radioactive and explosive materials in certain of our operations. Applicable regulatory requirements include those concerning:

-

the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials;

-

the importation and use of radioactive materials;

-

the use of underground storage tanks;

-

the use of underground injection wells; and

-

the protection of worker safety both onshore and offshore.

These and other requirements generally are becoming increasingly strict. The failure to comply with the requirements, many of which may be applied retroactively, may result in:

-

administrative, civil and criminal penalties;

-

revocation of permits to conduct business; and

-

corrective action orders, including orders to investigate and/or clean up contamination.

Failure on our part to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations or costs arising from regulatory compliance, including compliance with changes in or expansion of applicable regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternative energy sources may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. State, national and international governments and agencies in areas in which we conduct business continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

Our business could be materially and adversely affected by severe or unseasonable weather where we have operations.

Our business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather, particularly in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Russia and the North Sea. Many experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions may include:

-

evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services;

-

weather-related damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations;

-

weather-related damage to our facilities and project work sites;

-

inability to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules;

-

decreases in demand for oil and natural gas during unseasonably warm winters; and

-

loss of productivity.

Changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.

We have operations in more than


countries. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned and revenue-based tax withholding. Our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. The final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for the year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements.

We are subject to foreign currency exchange risks and limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries or to repatriate assets from some countries.

A sizable portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses is in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:

-

foreign currency exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and

-

limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.

As an example, we conduct business in countries that have restricted or limited trading markets for their local currencies and restrict or limit cash repatriation. We may accumulate cash in those geographies, but we may be limited in our ability to convert our profits into United States dollars or to repatriate the profits from those countries.

Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.

We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.

If we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced.

The market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

If we lose one or more of our significant customers or if our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We depend on a limited number of significant customers. While no single customer represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.

In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic or commodity price environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We sometimes provide integrated project management services in the form of long-term, fixed price contracts that may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, supplier and contractor pricing and performance, and potential claims for liquidated damages.

We sometimes provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business in the form of long-term, fixed price contracts. Some of these contracts are required by our customers, primarily national oil companies (NOCs). These services include acting as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost over-runs. These customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to their reserves, which is a subjective process that involves location and volume estimation, that may result in cost over-runs, delays and project losses. In addition, NOCs often operate in countries with unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, or other types of community issues. These issues may also result in cost over-runs, delays and project losses.

Providing services on an integrated basis may also require us to assume additional risks associated with operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, supplier pricing and performance, and potential claims for liquidated damages. We rely on third-party subcontractors and equipment providers to assist us with the completion of these types of contracts. To the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials in a timely manner and on reasonable terms, our ability to complete a project in accordance with stated deadlines or at a profit may be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price work, we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts. These delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to compensate our customers for these delays. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project.

Constraints in the supply of, prices for and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.

Raw materials essential to our business, such as proppants (primarily sand), hydrochloric acid, and gels, including guar gum, are normally readily available. Shortage of raw materials as a result of high levels of demand or loss of suppliers during market challenges can trigger constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. Many of the raw materials essential to our business require the use of rail, storage and trucking services to transport the materials to our jobsites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of or otherwise constrain our supply of raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials used in our business and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.

Our acquisitions, dispositions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

We continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint venture interests. These transactions are intended to (but may not) result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may use cash on hand or be financed by additional borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also affect our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 1(a) | Risk Factors

These transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that:

-

any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all;

-

any acquisitions would result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;

-

any acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;

-

the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, including under the FCPA, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;

-

any disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow;

-

use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or

-

any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions, including integration efforts, would not divert management resources.

Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.

We conduct some operations through joint ventures in which unaffiliated third parties may control the operations of the joint venture or we may share control. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.

Our ability to operate and our growth potential could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot attract, employ and retain technical personnel at a competitive cost.

Many of the services that we provide and the products that we sell are complex and highly engineered and often must perform or be performed in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize and enhance these services and products. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease and any growth potential could be impaired.

The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Financial results

We experienced challenging market dynamics in


as our customers in the North America market fundamentally shifted from growth to capital discipline, impacting our business through reduced customer activity and pricing pressure, while the international markets continued their recovery. We executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service quality, and remained focused on generating strong returns and cash flow. The following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.

During


, we generated total company revenue of

$22.4 billion

, a 7% decrease from the

$24.0 billion

of revenue generated in 2018, with our Completion and Production (C&P) segment declining by 12% and our Drilling and Evaluation (D&E) segment improving by 4%. We reported a total company operating loss of approximately

$448 million

in


driven by

$2.5 billion

of impairments and other charges. This compares to operating income of

$2.5 billion

in


. A significant decline in stimulation activity and pricing in North America land during 2019 negatively impacted operating results, coupled with reduced drilling activity in the Middle East.

Our North America revenue declined 18% in 2019, as compared to 2018, driven by reduced customer activity and pricing, and our decision to focus on customers that provide better returns. The North America land rig count decreased

26%

from its high point in early 2019 to its low point in December 2019, with a 9% drop from the third to the fourth quarter. Customer activity declined across all basins in North America land during the fourth quarter of 2019, affecting both our drilling and completions businesses. This reduction in activity resulted in part from our North American customers’ increase in capital discipline. With this backdrop, we moved quickly to implement a service delivery improvement strategy and initiate cost reductions, which included proactively managing our fleet count to anticipated levels of near-term demand, executing personnel reductions, and rationalizing our real estate portfolio. We performed this exercise with a focus on adjusting our cost structure to improve financial performance. We did, however, experience growth in many of our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses and will continue to focus on these businesses going forward.

With strong growth opportunities internationally, we continued to benefit from the recovery in this market as revenue increased 10% in 2019, as compared to 2018, outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. All international regions significantly contributed to this revenue increase, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, with meaningful contributions from both of our divisions. Our Completion and Production division led with a 13% increase in revenue due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia, while our Drilling and Evaluation division grew international revenues by 8% with increased activity levels in all markets, particularly Norway, Mexico, China and Nigeria.

Item 7 | Executive Overview

Business outlook

2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world's top hydrocarbon producer. Our company was an early participant in this development and invested and innovated alongside our customers since the beginning. As unconventionals enter the maturation phase and as capital spending by our customers has decreased, we remain committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment. The cost containment measures we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 should benefit our business as we adapt to this dynamic market environment.

In North America,

the shale industry is facing its biggest challenge since the 2015 downturn with a strong focus on capital discipline. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the market experienced a long-awaited attrition of equipment. More equipment is expected to exit the market in 2020 driven by lower demand and increasing service intensity. After systematically rationalizing and reducing equipment supply in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels, in 2020 we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet. We also expect customer spending behavior to remain similar to 2019 in which some operators spend a higher portion of their budgets earlier in the year. With North America customer spending expected to decline again in 2020, we will continue our strategy to maximize returns with an appropriate level of service capacity while continuing to invest in technologies that improve margins.

We plan to continue strategic growth opportunities with our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses. Our Wireline and Perforating, Artificial Lift, and Specialty Chemical product lines all produced strong double-digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in U.S. land, and we intend to build on this momentum and spread it to other services.

Internationally, we expect a third consecutive year of customer spending growth. We believe we have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete successfully across the international markets.

Our pipeline of projects is strong and we expect continued growth in our Drilling and Evaluation division as our iCruise rotary steerable drilling platform roll-out continues, new offshore drilling activity begins around the world, and we operate a full year of our Norway integrated contracts. Pricing in certain international regions is improving, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020. We are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we are making strategic choices about the work we pursue to deliver returns-driven growth in the international markets. We intend to be prudent with capital allocation with a strategic reallocation of assets to opportunities with better returns, driving the right pricing discussions with customers. We believe that with increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing improvements, and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services, we will achieve international margin expansion.

In 2020, we will continue to focus on delivering margin expansion and strong returns and cash flow while continuing to build the foundation for a longer-term recovery. We intend to dynamically respond to the changing market, invest effectively and remain flexible in our cost structure. We believe in responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, and investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation and returns. We will continue to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and align our business with customers in the fastest growing market segments with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen.

We intend to continue to strengthen our product service lines through a combination of organic growth, investment and selective acquisitions. We plan to continue executing the following strategies in


:

-

prudently allocating capital into strategic markets around the world;

-

collaborating with, and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for, our customers;

-

Item 7 | Executive Overview

Capital expenditures

During


, our capital expenditures were approximately $

1.5 billion

, a decrease of 24% from 2018, which were predominantly made in our

Sperry Drilling

,

Production Enhancement

,

Artificial Lift

,

Wireline and Perforating

, and

Production Solutions

product service lines. We intend to reduce our capital expenditures by 20% in 2020 to approximately $1.2 billion. We believe this level of spend, approximately 60% of which we plan to allocate to our Completion and Production division, will allow continued investments in our anticipated international growth while continuing to adjust our business to the current conditions in North America. Within this reduced budget, we will continue investing in and growing certain of our businesses, expanding our Artificial Lift footprint, continuing our global roll-out of our iCruise rotary steerable drilling platform, and focusing on digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs. However, the allocation of capital expenditures across business lines may change depending on market conditions. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors, regardless of the market environment.

Financial markets, liquidity and capital resources

We believe we have invested our cash balances conservatively and secured sufficient financing to help mitigate any near-term negative impact on our operations from adverse market conditions. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

$2.3 billion

of cash and equivalents and

$3.5 billion

of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility which expires in 2024. We believe this provides us with sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For additional information on market conditions, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Business Environment and Results of Operations.”

We paid

$630 million

of dividends to our shareholders.

–

We repurchased approximately

4.5 million

shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of approximately

$100 million

.

Future sources and uses of cash

We manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. Capital spending for


is currently expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of approximately 20% from 2019. For additional information on capital expenditures, see “Executive Overview.”

We are actively evaluating our debt maturity profile and other opportunities around uses of cash, which could include paying off portions of near-term debt, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or shareholder return opportunities.

Currently, our quarterly dividend rate is

$0.18

per common share, or approximately

$158 million

. Subject to Board of Directors approval, our intention is to continue paying dividends at our current rate during


. Our Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. Approximately

$5.2 billion

remained authorized for repurchases as of

December 31, 2019

and may be used for open market and other share purchases.

Contractual obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

:

(a)

Represents principal amounts of long-term debt, including current maturities of debt, which excludes any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts.

(b)

Interest on debt includes


years of interest on

only and are based on assumptions that are subject to change as we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contributions for years after


.

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. We had

$425 million

of gross

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources

unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, at

December 31, 2019

, of which we estimate $235 million may require a cash payment by us. We estimate that $205 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.

Other factors affecting liquidity

Financial position in current market.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

$2.3 billion

of cash and equivalents and

$3.5 billion

of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility which expires in 2024. Furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and our available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to address

the challenges and opportunities of the current market and

our global cash needs in


, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, dividends, if any, and contingent liabilities.

Guarantee agreements.

In the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately

$2.1 billion

of letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization.

Credit ratings.

Our credit ratings with Standard & Poor’s (S&P) remain A- for our long-term debt and A-2 for our short-term debt, with a negative outlook. Our credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service (Moody's) remain Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our short-term debt, with a stable outlook.

Customer receivables

. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. See

Note 5

to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Item 7 | Business Environment and Results of Operations

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We operate in more than


countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. Our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. The industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. In


,


and


, based on the location of services provided and products sold,

51%

,

58%

and

53%

, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.

Operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, health or similar issues, sanctions, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. We believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that an interruption of operations in any one country, other than the United States, would be materially adverse to our consolidated results of operations.

Activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. Also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption.

Some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity.

Additionally, many of our customers in North America have shifted their strategy from production growth to operating within cash flow and generating returns.

Lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. Our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.

The following table shows the average oil and natural gas prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), United Kingdom Brent crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas:

The historical average rig counts based on the weekly Baker Hughes rig count data were as follows:

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 7 | Business Environment and Results of Operations

Crude oil prices have been extremely volatile over the past five years. WTI oil spot prices declined significantly beginning in 2014 from a peak price of $108 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26 per barrel in February 2016, a level which had not been experienced since 2003. Since the low point experienced in early 2016, oil prices increased substantially, with WTI oil spot prices reaching a high of $77 per barrel in June 2018. In late 2018, oil prices again declined with WTI oil spot prices reaching a low of $44 per barrel in December

, but rising to a high of $66 per barrel in April 2019. The average full year 2019 WTI crude oil spot price of $57 decreased 12% from the average 2018 price

.

In the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) January 2020 "Short Term Energy Outlook," the EIA projected Brent prices to average $65 per barrel in 2020 and $68 per barrel in 2021, while WTI prices were projected to average approximately $5.50 less per barrel through 2020 and 2021. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) January 2020 "Oil Market Report" forecasts 2020 global demand to average approximately 101.5 million barrels per day, an increase of 1% from 2019, driven by increases in the Asia Pacific region, while all other regions remain approximately the same.

The Henry Hub natural gas spot price in the United States averaged

$2.54

per MMBtu in


, a decrease of $0.63 per MMBtu, or 20%, from


. The EIA January 2020 “Short Term Energy Outlook” projects Henry Hub natural gas prices to average $2.33 per MMBtu in 2020 and some upward price pressures to emerge in 2021 causing the average price to increase to $2.54 per MMBtu.

North America operations

The average North America rig count decreased 146 rigs, or 12%, for the full year


as compared to


.

The market for both drilling and completion services softened during the second half of 2019 with a continued reduction in activity as customers were focused on staying within their capital spending budgets. Some of the other factors leading to activity reductions included an oversupplied gas market and concerns about oil demand softness. In 2020, based on current information, we expect customers in U.S. land to reduce capital spending by approximately 10% from 2019 levels.

International operations

The average international rig count for


increased 110 rigs, or 11% compared to


. We continue to see a broad-based recovery across numerous international geographies, and we expect more revenue and margin growth opportunities coming from mature fields and shallow water markets in 2020. Barring a global economic slowdown, broader offshore recovery should add momentum to the international growth. In 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to slightly increase, making it the third consecutive year of spending growth.

Venezuela.

The general license issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of Treasury, which allows us to continue operating in Venezuela despite OFAC sanctions imposed against the Venezuelan energy industry, was set to expire on July 27, 2019, but has been extended several times and is now set to expire on April 22, 2020. Consequently, unless OFAC further extends the term of the general license, we will cease operations in Venezuela on that date in order to comply with the sanctions. In that event, it is unlikely that we will be able to remove our assets that remain in Venezuela and those assets may be expropriated. Since we have previously written down all of our investment in Venezuela and have maintained limited operations in this country during the general license period, we do not expect the expiration of the license to have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Item 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. Our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. We identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:

-

forecasting our effective income tax rate, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;

-

legal and investigation matters;

-

valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill;

-

purchase price allocation for acquired businesses; and

-

allowance for bad debts.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.

Income tax accounting

We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:

-

a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;

-

a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;

-

the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and

-

the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

We determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures:

-

identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences;

-

measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;

-

measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;

-

measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and

-

reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment in the use of assumptions and estimates. Additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results. Unforeseen events may significantly impact these variables, and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to both continuing and discontinued operations.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates

We have operations in more than


countries. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned and revenue-based tax withholding. Our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. The final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements.

Tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. These examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. Predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. Factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. We review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest and penalties as needed based on this outcome. We provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

Legal and investigation matters

As discussed in

Note 10

of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. As of

December 31, 2019

, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. For other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. Attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. Our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. We attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. We have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.

Value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. We conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

When conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on a the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets, which requires some judgment. We then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group’s carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis is based on estimates such as management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. See

Note 2

to the consolidated financial statements for impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates

We perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the Completion and Production division and the Drilling and Evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.

The impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. If market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. See

Note 1

to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.

Acquisitions - purchase price allocation

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Our acquisitions may also include contingent consideration, or earn-out provisions, which provide for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. These earn-out provisions are estimated and recognized at fair value at the acquisition date based on projected earnings or other financial metrics over specified periods after the acquisition date. These estimates are reviewed during the specified period and adjusted based on actual results.

Allowance for bad debts

We evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers and whether the receivables involve retainages. We also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. Based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.

At December 31, 2019, our allowance for bad debts totaled $776 million, or 15.4% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. At December 31, 2018, our allowance for bad debts totaled $738 million, or 12.8% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. The allowance for bad debts in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable with our primary customer in Venezuela. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2019 would have resulted in a $51 million adjustment to 2019 total operating costs and expenses. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

At

December 31, 2019

, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately

$2.1 billion

of letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds were outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. None of these off balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 7 | Financial Instrument Market Risk

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. The objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. The counterparties to our forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.

We use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. With respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our foreign exchange hedges, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the United States dollar as of

December 31, 2019

would result in a $91 million, pre-tax, loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than United States dollars. With respect to interest rates sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our interest rate swap, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate would result in approximately an additional $1 million of interest charges for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Halliburton Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

based upon criteria set forth in the

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of

December 31, 2019

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The effectiveness of Halliburton’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY

by

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors

Halliburton Company:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated

February 11, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of the Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets

As discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.3 billion and a related valuation allowance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.

We identified the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter. This evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets, specifically related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits, required subjective auditor judgment to assess the forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Changes in assumptions regarding forecasted taxable income could have an impact on the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls related to the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls related to the development of forecasts of future taxable income. We evaluated the assumptions used in the development of forecasts of future taxable income by comparing to historical actuals while considering current and anticipated future commodity prices or market events. We also evaluated the Company’s history of realizing deferred tax assets by evaluating the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits.

Assessment of the Fair Value of Property, Plant and Equipment

As discussed in Notes 1, 2, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the gross amount of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2019 was $19.9 billion and related accumulated depreciation of $12.6 billion. The Company recognizes impairment on property, plant and equipment when the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group is less than the carrying amount of the asset group. The Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We identified the assessment of the Company’s estimate of the fair value of property, plant and equipment as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the significant assumptions used in determining the discounted cash flows needed to estimate the fair value of the asset groups, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margin and the discount rate used.

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s process to estimate the discounted cash flows of the asset groups, including controls related to the significant assumptions. We evaluated the Company’s development of the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by identifying and assessing the sources of data that management used in their assessment. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin for consistency with relevant historical data, changes in the business, and external industry data.  In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist with evaluating the selected discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors

Halliburton Company:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Halliburton Company's and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

-

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

-

Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated

February 11, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

HALLIBURTON COMPANY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1

.

Description of Company and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Company

Halliburton Company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. Its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1924. We help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset. We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world and operate under

two

divisions, which form the basis for the

two

operating segments we report, the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment.

Use of estimates

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:

-

the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and

-

the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

We believe the most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the forecasting of our effective income tax rate and the valuation of deferred taxes, legal reserves, long-lived asset valuations, purchase price allocations, and allowance for bad debts. Ultimate results could differ from our estimates.

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in companies in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. If we do not have significant influence, we use the cost method of accounting. In addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation.

Revenue recognition

Our services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices but do not include right of return provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. The vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. We recognize revenue based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. We also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with and the financial condition of our customers. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour or similar basis.

See

Note 4

for further information on revenue recognition.

Research and development

We maintain an active research and development program. The program improves products, processes and engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs of our customers, such as those related to high pressure and high temperature environments, and also develops new products and processes. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


and

$


million

in


.

Cash equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of

three months

or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost. Production cost includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead. The majority of our inventory is recorded on the average cost method. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, estimated product demand and technological developments.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Allowance for bad debts

We establish an allowance for bad debts through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. Our policy is to write off bad debts when the customer accounts are determined to be uncollectible.

Property, plant and equipment

Other than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to impairment, property, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes, wherever permitted. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. Planned major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for additions, modifications and conversions are capitalized when they increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

We record as goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are detailed below by reportable segment.

The reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the third quarter, and more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. Due to the impairments and other charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our goodwill impairment assessment through December 31, 2019. As a result of our goodwill impairment assessments performed in the years ended December 31,


,


and


, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore,

no

goodwill impairments were deemed necessary.

For further information on our goodwill impairment assessments, see "Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

– Critical Accounting Estimates.”

We amortize other identifiable intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows, ranging from

one year

to

twenty-eight years

. The components of these other intangible assets generally consist of patents, license agreements, non-compete agreements, trademarks and customer lists and contracts.

Evaluating impairment of long-lived assets

When events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. For assets classified as held for use, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. We then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. If the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis and recognize any resulting impairment. When an asset is classified as held for sale, the asset’s book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held for sale.

See

Note 2

for further information on impairments and other charges recorded in 2019.

Income taxes

We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative instruments

At times, we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected through the results of operations. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against:

-

the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings; or

-

recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings. Recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage foreign currency exchange risk are included in “Other, net” on the consolidated statements of operations. Gains or losses on interest rate derivatives are included in “Interest expense, net.”

Foreign currency translation

Foreign entities whose functional currency is the United States dollar translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates. Revenue and expense transactions are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses associated with nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates. Gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in “Other, net” in the year of occurrence.

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee’s service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. Additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.

See

Note 13

for additional information related to stock-based compensation.

Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 2

Impairments and Other Charges

Market conditions negatively impacted our business during 2019, particularly in North America. We experienced continued pricing pressure and customer activity reductions for our products and services. The North America land rig count decreased


%

from its high point in early 2019 to its low point in December 2019, and we idled equipment throughout the year to adjust to changing activity levels. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the North America market continued to deteriorate with a


%

decrease in the average land rig count compared to the third quarter. Customer activity declined across all basins, affecting both our drilling and completions businesses, and pricing pressure persisted during the year-end tendering season.

As a result of these market conditions and our service delivery improvement strategy, we took actions during the fourth quarter of 2019 to proactively manage our equipment fleet, rationalize our portfolio of real estate facilities, and initiate reductions in our global workforce in an effort to mitigate the impact of market deterioration and better align our workforce with anticipated activity levels. As part of our real estate rationalization, we identified owned properties to sell and leased properties to abandon. We reviewed the recoverability of our long-lived assets and, based upon our impairment assessments, we determined the carrying amount of some of our long-lived assets exceeded their respective fair values.

We determined the fair value of our long-lived assets based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the exception of real estate facilities classified as held for sale for which fair value was based on third party sales price estimates. These fair value assessments required the use of estimates which represent significant unobservable inputs. The discounted cash flow analysis utilized management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, the remaining useful life and service potential of the asset, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. As such, these analyses incorporate inherent uncertainties about commodity prices, supply and demand for our services, and future market conditions that are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments. If market conditions worsen, our fair value assumptions of estimated future cash flows could be materially altered and we may be required to record additional asset impairments. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.

As a result of the events described above, we recorded impairments and other charges of approximately

$

2.5

billion

during the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following table presents various pre-tax charges we recorded during the years ended

December 31, 2019

which are reflected within "Impairments and other charges" on our consolidated statements of operations.

Of the

of impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately

$

1.6

billion

was attributable to our Completion and Production segment and approximately

$


million

was attributable to our Drilling and Evaluation segment. Long-lived asset impairments include impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and real estate facilities. The

Business Segment and Geographic Information

We operate under

two

divisions, which form the basis for the

two

operating segments we report: the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment. For more information about the product service lines included in each segment, see "Part I, Item 1. Business.” The business operations of our divisions are organized around

four

primary geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East/Asia. Our equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within cost of services and cost of sales on our statements of operations, which is part of operating income of the applicable segment.

Operations by business segment

The following tables present financial information on our business segments.

Revenue

Revenue is recognized based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. The vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. In recognizing revenue for our services and products, we determine the transaction price of purchase orders or contracts with our customers, which may consist of fixed and variable consideration. We also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with and the financial condition of our customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within


to


days

. Other judgments involved in recognizing revenue include an assessment of progress towards completion of performance obligations for certain long-term contracts, which involve estimating total costs to determine our progress towards contract completion and calculating the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize.

Disaggregation of revenue

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Contract balances

We perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. The timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customer’s payment, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents advance consideration received from customers for contracts where revenue is recognized on future performance of service. Deferred revenue, as well as revenue recognized during the period relating to amounts included as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period, was not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent firm contracts for which work has not been performed and future revenue recognition is expected. We have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of

one year

or less. We have some long-term contracts related to software and integrated project management services such as lump sum turnkey contracts. For software contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time throughout the license period when the software is considered to be a right to access our intellectual property. For lump sum turnkey projects, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, which requires us to exercise judgment. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for these long-term contracts is not material.

Leases

We adopted a comprehensive new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. The details of the significant changes to our accounting policies resulting from the adoption of the new standard are set out below. We adopted the standard using the optional modified retrospective transition method; accordingly, the comparative information as of December 31, 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the previous lease standard. Under the new lease standard, assets and liabilities that arise from all leases are required to be recognized on the balance sheet for lessees. Previously, only capital leases, which are now referred to as finance leases, were recorded on the balance sheet. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately

$

1.0

billion

of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. See

Note 17

for additional information about the new accounting standard.

Beginning January 1, 2019, for all leases with a term in excess of 12 months, we recognized a lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while finance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. For all leases with a term of 12 months or less, we elected the practical expedient to not recognize lease assets and liabilities. We recognize lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We are a lessee for numerous operating leases, primarily related to real estate, transportation and equipment. The vast majority of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of


years

or less, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. We generally do not include renewal or termination options in our assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain. The accounting for some of our leases may require judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the incremental borrowing rates to utilize in our net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate, and assessing the likelihood of renewal or termination options. We also have some lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. For certain equipment leases, such as offshore vessels and drilling rigs, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.

The following tables illustrate the financial impact of our leases as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, along with other supplemental information about our existing leases:

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total rentals on our operating leases under the previous lease standard, net of sublease rentals, were

In accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a company’s foreign earnings accumulated under the legacy tax laws are deemed to be repatriated into the United States. We have provided federal and state income tax related to this deemed repatriation. We have not provided incremental United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of

Our Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended (Stock Plan), provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of stock-based awards:

-

stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;

-

restricted stock awards;

-

restricted stock unit awards;

-

stock appreciation rights; and

-

stock value equivalent awards.

There are currently no stock appreciation rights, stock value equivalent awards, or incentive stock options outstanding. Under the terms of the Stock Plan, approximately


million

shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees and non-employee directors. At

December 31, 2019

, approximately


million

shares were available for future grants under the Stock Plan. The stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the Stock Plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.

In addition to the provisions of the Stock Plan, we also have stock-based compensation provisions under our Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

Each of the active stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below.

Stock options

The majority of our options are generally issued during the second quarter of the year. All stock options under the Stock Plan are granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. Employee stock options generally vest ratably over a period of

three years

and expire

The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility of options granted was a blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on actively traded options on our common stock and upon the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of options granted was based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees.

The assumptions and resulting fair values of options granted were as follows:

Restricted stock

Restricted shares issued under the Stock Plan are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse periodically generally over a period of

five years

. Restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established policies. Upon termination of employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the ESPP, eligible employees may have up to


%

of their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. The ESPP contains

four

three-month offering periods commencing on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The price at which common stock may be purchased under the ESPP is equal to


%

of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each offering period. Effective January 1, 2020, this purchase price threshold was changed from

Income per Share

Basic income or loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share includes additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Antidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted income or loss per share as their impact was antidilutive.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

The carrying amount of cash and equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.

The carrying amount and fair value of our total debt, including short-term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt, is as follows:

Our debt categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities with transactions occurring on the last

two days

of period-end. Our debt categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using significant observable inputs for similar liabilities where estimated values are determined from observable data points on our other bonds and on other similarly rated corporate debt or from observable data points of transactions occurring prior to

two days

from period-end and adjusting for changes in market conditions. Differences between the periods presented in our level 1 and level 2 classification of our long-term debt relate to the timing of when transactions are executed. We have

no

debt categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy based on unobservable inputs.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. The objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of our forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps was not material as of

December 31, 2019

or

December 31, 2018

. The counterparties to our derivatives are primarily global commercial and investment banks.

HAL 2019 FORM 10-K |



Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Foreign currency exchange risk

We have operations in many international locations and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, our functional currency, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Techniques in managing foreign currency exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign currency borrowing and investing and the use of currency exchange instruments. We attempt to selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign currency exchange losses based on current market conditions, future operating activities and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. The purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities is to minimize the risk that our cash flows from the purchase and sale of products and services in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

We use forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies of certain countries in which we do business internationally. These instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes, generally have an expiration date of

one year

or less and are not exchange traded. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being managed. The use of some of these instruments may limit our ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Derivatives are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded currencies). We attempt to manage our working capital position to minimize foreign currency exposure in non-traded currencies and recognize that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should account for the cost of exchange rate devaluations. We have historically incurred transaction losses in non-traded currencies.

The notional amounts of open foreign exchange derivatives were

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

. The notional amounts of these instruments do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these contracts. The fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

is included in “Other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. The fair value of these instruments is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with certain inputs, such as notional amounts hedged, exchange rates, and other terms of the contracts that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.

Interest rate risk

We are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings do not give rise to significant interest rate risk due to their short-term nature. We had fixed rate long-term debt totaling

$

10.3

billion

at both

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

. We maintain an interest rate management strategy that is intended to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates in the aggregate for our debt portfolio. We use interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating LIBOR-based rates. Our interest rate swaps, which expire when the underlying debt matures, are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt and are determined to be highly effective. These derivative instruments are marked to market with gains and losses recognized currently in interest expense to offset the respective gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had an interest rate swap relating to one of our debt instruments with a total notional amount of

$


million

. The fair value of this interest rate swap as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

is included in “Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. The fair value of this interest rate swap is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with inputs, such as the notional amount, LIBOR rate spread and settlement terms that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.

Credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents and trade receivables. It is our practice to place our cash equivalents in high quality investments with various institutions. Our trade receivables are from a broad and diverse group of customers and are generally not collateralized. As of

December 31, 2019

,


%

of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States. As of

December 31, 2018

,


%

of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States. We maintain an allowance for bad debts based upon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. See

Note 5

for further information.

We do not have any significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty to our derivative contracts. We select counterparties to those contracts based on our belief that each counterparty’s profitability, balance sheet and capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is unlikely to be materially adversely affected by foreseeable events.

Retirement Plans

Our company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of our employees. These plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans:

-

our defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. These plans provide an individual account for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the participant’s account are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the participant is to receive. Contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of pre-tax income, after-tax income, or discretionary amounts determined on an annual basis. Our expense for the defined contribution plans for continuing operations totaled

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


and

$

-

our defined benefit plans, which include both funded and unfunded pension plans, define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of service and/or compensation. The unfunded obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our United States defined benefit plans were not material for the periods presented; and

Item 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit obligations and rates of compensation increases vary by plan according to local economic conditions. Where possible, discount rates were determined based on the prevailing market rates of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined based upon an evaluation of our plan assets and historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Standards adopted in 2019

Leases

Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted an accounting standard update issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) related to accounting for leases, which requires lessees to record assets and liabilities that arise for all leases on their balance sheet and expanded financial statement disclosures for both lessees and lessors. We adopted this standard using the optional modified retrospective transition method. As such, the comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease standard in effect during those periods. We also elected other practical expedients provided by the new standard, including the package of practical expedients, the short-term lease recognition practical expedient in which leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our leases. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately

$

1.0

billion

of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. Additionally, capital leases have been reclassified on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 to conform to current period presentation. This consisted of

$


million

reclassified from property, plant and equipment to other assets and

$


million

reclassified from long-term debt to other liabilities. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. See

Note 6

for further information about the new lease standard and our expanded lease disclosures.

Controls and Procedures

.

In accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2019

to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2019

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

See page 35 for Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and page 38 for Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
