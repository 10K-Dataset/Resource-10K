General
      description of business

Halliburton
      Company’s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
      the State of Delaware in 1924. Halliburton Company provides a variety of
      services, products, maintenance, engineering, and construction to energy,
      industrial, and governmental customers.

Our
      six
      business segments are organized around how we manage the business: Production
      Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, Digital and
      Consulting Solutions, Government and Infrastructure, and Energy and Chemicals.
      We refer to the combination of Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions segments as
      our
      Energy Services Group (ESG) and to the Government and Infrastructure and Energy
      and Chemicals segments as KBR. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial
      statements for financial information about our business segments.

Description
      of services and products

We
      offer
      a broad suite of services and products through our six business segments. The
      following summarizes our services and products for each business
      segment.

ENERGY
      SERVICES GROUP

The
      ESG
      provides a wide range of services and products to customers for the exploration,
      development, and production of oil and gas. The ESG serves major, national,
      and
      independent oil and gas companies throughout the world.

Production
      Optimization

Our
      Production Optimization segment primarily tests, measures, and provides means
      to
      manage and/or improve well production once a well is drilled and, in some cases,
      after it has been producing. This segment consists of production enhancement
      services and completion tools and services.

Production
      enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
      sand control services, coiled tubing tools and services, and hydraulic workover
      services. Stimulation services optimize oil and gas reservoir production through
      a variety of pressure pumping services and chemical processes, commonly known
      as
      fracturing and acidizing. Pipeline process services include pipeline and
      facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping, chemical
      systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the midstream
      and downstream sectors of the energy business. Sand control services include
      fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the prevention of formation
      sand production.

Completion
      tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
      surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
      completion systems, production automation, expandable liner hanger systems,
      sand
      control systems, slickline equipment and services, self-elevated workover
      platforms, tubing-conveyed perforating services and products, well servicing
      tools, and reservoir performance services. Reservoir performance services
      include drill stem and other well testing tools and services, underbalanced
      applications and real-time reservoir analysis, data acquisition services, and
      production applications.

Also
      included in this segment is WellDynamics, an intelligent well completions joint
      venture, which we consolidate for accounting purposes. Additionally, subsea
      operations conducted by Subsea 7, Inc., of which we formerly owned 50%, were
      included in this segment. We accounted for our 50% ownership of Subsea 7, Inc.
      using the equity method until January 2005, when we completed the sale of our
      interest in this joint venture to our partner, Siem Offshore (formerly DSND
      Subsea ASA).

Fluid
      Systems

Our
      Fluid
      Systems segment focuses on providing services and technologies to assist in
      the
      drilling and construction of oil and gas wells. This segment offers cementing
      and drilling fluids systems.

Cementing
      is the process used to bond the well and well casing while isolating fluid
      zones
      and maximizing wellbore stability. Cement and chemical additives are pumped
      to
      fill the space between the casing and the side of the wellbore. Our cementing
      service line also provides casing services and equipment.


Baroid
      Fluid Services provides drilling fluid systems, performance additives, solids
      control, and waste management services for oil and gas drilling, completion,
      and
      workover operations. In addition, Baroid Fluid Services sells products to a
      wide
      variety of industrial customers. Drilling fluids usually contain bentonite
      or
      barite in a water or oil base. Drilling fluids primarily improve wellbore
      stability and facilitate the transportation of cuttings from the bottom of
      a
      wellbore to the surface. Drilling fluids also help cool the drill bit, seal
      porous well formations, and assist in pressure control within a wellbore.
      Drilling fluids are often customized by onsite engineers for optimum stability
      and enhanced oil production.

Also
      included in this segment is our investment in Enventure, an expandable casing
      joint venture, which we account for using the cost method.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

Our
      Drilling and Formation

Evaluation
      segment is primarily involved in the drilling and formation evaluation process
      during bore-hole construction. Major services and products offered
      include:

-

drilling
                systems and services;

-

drill
                bits; and

-

logging
                services.

Sperry
      Drilling Services provides drilling systems and services. These services include
      directional and horizontal drilling, measurement-while-drilling,
      logging-while-drilling, multilateral systems, and rig site information systems.
      Our drilling systems offer directional control while providing important
      measurements about the characteristics of the drill string and geological
      formations while drilling directional wells. Real-time operating capabilities
      enable the monitoring of well progress and aid decision-making
      processes.

Security
      DBS Drill Bits provides roller cone rock bits, fixed cutter bits, and related
      downhole tools used in drilling oil and gas wells. In addition, coring services
      and equipment are provided to acquire cores of the formation drilled for
      evaluation.

Logging
      services include open-hole wireline services, which provide information on
      formation evaluation such as resistivity, porosity, and density, rock mechanics,
      and fluid sampling. Cased-hole services are also offered, which provide cement
      bond evaluation, reservoir monitoring, pipe evaluation, pipe recovery, and
      perforating.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

Our
      Digital and Consulting Solutions segment provides integrated exploration,
      drilling, and production software information systems, consulting services,
      real-time operations, and other integrated solutions.

Landmark
      is a supplier of integrated exploration, drilling, and production software
      information systems as well as professional and data management services for
      the
      upstream oil and gas industry. Landmark software transforms vast quantities
      of
      seismic, well log, and other data into detailed computer models of petroleum
      reservoirs. The models are used by our customers to achieve optimal business
      and
      technical decisions in exploration, development, and production activities.
      Data
      management services provide efficient storage, browsing, and retrieval of large
      volumes of exploration and petroleum data. The services and products offered
      by
      Landmark integrate data workflows and operational processes across disciplines,
      including geophysics, geology, drilling, engineering, production, economics,
      finance, corporate planning, and key partners and suppliers.

This
      segment also provides value-added oilfield project management and integrated
      solutions to independent, integrated, and national oil companies. These
      offerings make use of all of our oilfield services, products, technologies,
      and
      project management capabilities to assist our customers in optimizing the value
      of their oil and gas assets.

Additionally,
      this segment holds investments in upstream oil and gas properties, primarily
      in
      the North America region, which leverage our technology, knowledge, and access
      to services and products.

KBR

KBR
      provides a wide range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers
      and government entities worldwide through two business segments, Government
      and
      Infrastructure and Energy and Chemicals.

Government
      and Infrastructure

Our
      Government and Infrastructure segment focuses on:

-

construction,
                maintenance, and logistics services for government operations, facilities,
                and installations;


-

civil
                engineering, construction, consulting, and project management services
                for
                state and local government agencies and private
                industries;

-

integrated
                security solutions, including threat definition assessments, mitigation,
                and consequence management; design, engineering and program management;
                construction and delivery; and physical security, operations, and
                maintenance;

-

dockyard
                operation and management through the Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited
                (DML), which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes, with
                services that include design, construction, surface/subsurface fleet
                maintenance, nuclear engineering and refueling, and weapons engineering;
                and

-

privately
                financed initiatives, in which KBR funds the development or provision
                of
                an asset, such as a facility, service, or infrastructure for a government
                client, which we then own, operate and maintain, enabling our clients
                to
                utilize new assets at a reasonable
                cost.

Also
      included in this segment is our investment in the Alice Springs-Darwin Railroad
      (ASD). ASD is a privately financed project that was formed in 2001 to build
      and
      operate the transcontinental railroad from Alice Springs to Darwin, Australia.
      ASD has been granted a 50-year concession period by the Australian government.
      KBR provided engineering, procurement, and construction services for ASD and
      is
      the largest equity holder in the project with a 36.7% interest, with the
      remaining equity held by eleven other participants. We account for this
      investment under the equity method.

As
      part
      of our infrastructure projects, we occasionally take an ownership interest
      in
      the constructed asset, with a view toward monetization of that ownership
      interest after the asset has been operating for some period and increases in
      value. In this regard, in September 2005 we sold our 13% interest in a joint
      venture that owned the Dulles Greenway Toll Road in Virginia and recorded an
      $85
      million gain on the sale.

Energy
      and Chemicals

Our
      Energy and Chemicals segment is a global engineering, procurement, construction,
      technology, and services provider for the energy and chemicals industries.
      Working both upstream and downstream in support of our customers, the Energy

      in this segment are a number of joint ventures including the
      following:

-

TSKJ
                is a joint venture company formed to design and construct large scale
                projects in Nigeria. TSKJ’s members are Technip, SA of France,
                Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V., which is an affiliate of ENI SpA of
                Italy,
                JGC Corporation of Japan, and KBR, each of which owns 25%. TSKJ has
                completed five LNG production facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria
                and is
                currently working on a sixth such facility. We account for this investment

                KBR and
                45% by JGC Corporation. We consolidate MWKL for financial reporting
                purposes.


Business
      strategy

Our
      business strategy is to maintain global leadership in providing energy services
      and products and engineering and construction services. Our ability to be a
      global leader depends on meeting four key goals:

-

establishing
                and maintaining technological
                leadership;

-

achieving
                and continuing operational
                excellence;

-

creating
                and continuing innovative business relationships;
                and

-

preserving
                a dynamic workforce.

We
      also
      plan to initiate the separation of KBR from Halliburton in 2006. Our decision
      to
      separate KBR arose primarily because we do not believe the full value of KBR
      is
      currently reflected in Halliburton’s stock price, and few synergies exist
      between the two business units. Our current plan is to effect an initial public
      offering (IPO) of less than 20% of KBR. We believe the IPO market is attractive,
      and valuation multiples of publicly traded engineering and construction
      companies are currently favorable. In response to interest we have received,
      we
      may consider selling some pieces of KBR, but this is not expected to change
      our
      IPO plans for the remainder of KBR. We expect that a Form S-1 for KBR will
      be
      filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after
      the
      2005 audited financial statements of KBR are complete. Any sale of KBR stock
      would be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and such shares of common
      stock would only be offered and sold by means of a prospectus. This annual

Markets
      and competition

We
      are
      one of the world’s largest diversified energy services and engineering and
      construction services companies. Our services and products are sold in highly
      competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales
      of
      our services and products include:

-

price;

-

service
                delivery (including the ability to deliver services and products
                on an “as
                needed, where needed” basis);

-

health,
                safety, and environmental standards and
                practices;

-

service
                quality;

-

product
                quality;

-

warranty;
                and

-

technical
                proficiency.

We
      conduct business worldwide in about 100 countries. In 2005, based on the
      location of services provided and products sold, 27% of our consolidated revenue
      was from the United States, 24% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq,
      primarily related to our work for the United States Government, and 10% of
      our
      consolidated revenue was from the United Kingdom. In 2004, 26% of our
      consolidated revenue was from Iraq and 22% of our consolidated revenue was
      from
      the United States. In 2003, 27% of our consolidated revenue was from the United
      States and 15% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq. No other country
      accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during these periods.
      See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional financial
      information about geographic operations in the last three years. Because the
      markets for our services and products are vast and cross numerous geographic
      lines, a meaningful estimate of the total number of competitors cannot be made.
      The industries we serve are highly competitive and we have many substantial
      competitors. Largely all of our services and products are marketed through
      our
      servicing and sales organizations.

Operations
      in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
      acts of terrorism, civil unrest, expropriation or other governmental actions,
      and exchange control and currency problems. Except for our government services
      work in Iraq discussed above, we believe the geographic diversification of
      our
      business activities reduces the risk that loss of operations in any one country
      would be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a
      whole.

Information
      regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration,
      and
      financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
      Financial Instrument Market Risk and in Note 17 to the consolidated financial
      statements.


Customers

Our
      revenue during the past three years was mainly derived from the sale of services
      and products to the energy industry, including 61% in 2005, 54% in 2004, and
      66%
      in 2003. Revenue from the United States Government, resulting primarily from
      work performed in the Middle East by our Government and Infrastructure segment,
      represented 31% of our 2005 consolidated revenue, 39% of our 2004 consolidated
      revenue, and 26% of our 2003 consolidated revenue. No other customer represented
      more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented.

Backlog

Backlog
      represents the total dollar amount of revenue we expect to realize in the future
      as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us.
      Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles,
      and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the
      methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog. Backlog may
      not be indicative of future operating results. Many contracts do not provide
      for
      a fixed amount of work to be performed and are subject to modification or
      termination by the customer. The termination or modification of any one or
      more
      sizeable contracts or the addition of other contracts may have a substantial
      and
      immediate effect on backlog.

We
      generally include the full value of contracts in backlog when a contract is
      awarded and/or the scope is definitized. On our projects related to
      unconsolidated joint ventures, we include our percentage ownership of the joint
      venture’s backlog. For long-term contracts, the amount included in backlog is
      limited to five years. In many instances, arrangements included in backlog
      are
      complex, nonrepetitive in nature, and may fluctuate in contract value and
      timing. Where contract duration is indefinite, projects included in backlog
      are
      limited to the estimated value of work to be completed within the following
      twelve months. Certain contracts provide maximum dollar limits, with actual
      authorization to perform work under the contract being agreed upon on a periodic
      basis with the customer. In these arrangements, only the amounts authorized
      are
      included in backlog. For projects where we solely act in a project management
      capacity, we only include our management scope of each project in
      backlog.

The
      following table summarizes our project backlog:

We
      estimate that 76% of the Government and Infrastructure segment backlog and
      52%
      of the Energy and Chemicals segment backlog at December 31, 2005 will be
      completed during 2006. Approximately 56% of total backlog at December 31, 2005
      related to cost-reimbursable contracts with the remaining 44% relating to
      fixed-price contracts. Our backlog for projects related to unconsolidated joint
      ventures totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and $1.1 billion at December
      31, 2004. The increase in the government orders firm but not yet funded, letters
      of intent, and contracts awarded but not signed related to Task Order No. 89,
      assigned in the second quarter of 2005 under the LogCAP contract, that replaced
      several task orders that were nearing completion. Our backlog excludes contracts
      for recurring hardware and software maintenance and support services offered
      by
      Landmark.


Raw
      materials

Raw
      materials essential to our business are normally readily available. Current
      market conditions have triggered constraints in the supply chain of certain
      raw
      materials, such as, sand, cement, and specialty metals. The majority of our
      risk
      associated with the current supply chain constraints occurs in those situations
      where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource.
      Given high activity levels, particularly in the United States, we are
      proactively seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as
      manage the rising costs of raw materials. Our procurement department is actively
      leveraging our size and buying power through several programs designed to ensure
      that we have access to key materials at the best possible prices.

Research
      and development costs

We
      maintain an active research and development program. The program improves
      existing products and processes, develops new products and processes, and
      improves engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs
      of
      our customers. Our expenditures for research and development activities were
      $220 million in 2005, $234 million in 2004, and $221 million in 2003, of which
      over 97% was company-sponsored in each year.

Patents

We
      own a
      large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent
      applications covering various products and processes. We are also licensed
      to
      utilize patents owned by others. We do not consider any particular patent or
      group of patents to be material to our business operations.

Seasonality

On
      an
      overall basis, our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. Weather
      and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services,
      but the widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate
      those effects. Examples of how weather can impact our business
      include:

-

the
                severity and duration of the winter in North America can have a
                significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for
                natural
                gas;

-

the
                timing and duration of the spring thaw in Canada directly affects
                activity
                levels due to road restrictions;

-

typhoons
                and hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations;
                and

-

severe
                weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity
                levels in the North Sea and Russia.

In
      addition, due to higher spending near the end of the year by customers for
      software, Landmark results of operations are generally stronger in the fourth
      quarter of the year than at the beginning of the year.

Employees

At
      December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 106,000 people worldwide compared
      to 97,000 at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, approximately 9% of our
      employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Based upon the
      geographic diversification of these employees, we believe any risk of loss
      from
      employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the
      conduct of our operations taken as a whole.

Environmental
      regulation

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.


In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations.

All
      of
      our owned properties are unencumbered.

In
      addition, we have 145 international and 108 United States field camps from
      which
      the ESG delivers its services and products. We also have numerous small
      facilities that include sales offices, project offices, and bulk storage
      facilities throughout the world. We own or lease marine fabrication facilities
      covering approximately 446 acres in Texas, England (primarily related to DML),
      and Scotland, which are used by KBR. Our marine facilities located in Texas
      and
      Scotland are currently for sale.

We
      have
      mineral rights to proven and probable reserves of barite and bentonite. These
      rights include leaseholds, mining claims, and owned property. We process barite
      and bentonite for use in our Fluid Systems segment in addition to supplying
      many
      industrial markets worldwide. Based on the number of tons of bentonite consumed
      in fiscal year 2005, we estimate that our 20 million tons of proven reserves
      in
      areas of active mining are sufficient to fulfill our internal and external
      needs
      for the next 14 years. We estimate that our 2.6 million tons of proven reserves
      of barite in areas of active mining equate to a 12-year supply based on current
      rates of production. These estimates are subject to change based on periodic
      updates to reserve estimates, future consumption, mining economics, and changes
      in environmental legislation.

We
      believe all properties that we currently occupy are suitable for their intended
      use.

Item
      5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities.

Halliburton
      Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Information
      relating to the high and low market prices of common stock and quarterly
      dividend payments is included under the caption “Quarterly Data and Market Price
      Information” on page 115 of this annual report. Cash dividends on common stock
      for 2005 and 2004 in the amount of $0.125 per share were paid in March, June,
      September, and December of each year. Our Board of Directors intends to consider
      the payment of quarterly dividends on the outstanding shares of our common
      stock
      in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends, however, will
      be
      at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other
      things, future earnings, general financial condition and liquidity, success
      in
      business activities, capital requirements, and general business
      conditions.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up
      to
      $1.0 billion. The Board of Directors approved a dividend for the first quarter
      of 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2006
      of
      $0.15 per share, payable on March 23, 2006 reflecting a dividend increase of
      $0.025 per share. The Board of Directors also approved a 2:1 stock split,
      subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 annual shareholders meeting of
      a
      proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from one
      billion shares to two billion shares. Each shareholder would receive one
      additional share for each outstanding share held by the shareholder on the
      record date for the stock split. The record date will be announced after the
      approval of the increase in authorized shares of common stock.

At
      February 15, 2006, there were 20,912 shareholders of record. In calculating
      the
      number of shareholders, we consider clearing agencies and security position
      listings as one shareholder for each agency or listing.

      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
      of
      the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
      Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
      and
      procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005 to provide reasonable
      assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
      submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
      reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
      Commission’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include
      controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
      disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated
      and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
      Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
      required disclosure.

There
      has
      been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
      during the three months ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected,
      or
      is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
      reporting.

HALLIBURTON
      COMPANY

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

EXECUTIVE
      OVERVIEW

While
      2005 began with the finalization of our asbestos and silica settlements in
      January, the highlight of the year was the strong operational performance of
      both of our business units, the Energy Services Group (ESG) and
      KBR.

ESG
      improved performance with a 26% increase in revenue and an 80% increase in
      operating income, compared to 2004. ESG operating margin (defined as operating
      income divided by revenue) increased nearly seven percentage points to 22.6%
      from 15.8% in 2004. ESG’s improved operating income and margins in 2005 compared
      to 2004 are a direct result of:

-

higher
                demand for oilfield services, with annual average worldwide rig counts
                increasing approximately 15%;

-

improved
                utilization of equipment, which was evident by an increase in our
                revenue
                per fracturing job over 2004;

-

increased
                pricing, particularly in areas of high demand and tight supply;
                and

-

our
                continued focus on operating performance and return on capital. Our
                focus
                centered on exiting underperforming operations, achieving improved
                contract terms with our customers, and redeploying resources to more
                attractive markets.

At
      KBR,
      we saw the benefits from restructuring KBR in 2004. KBR delivered $498 million
      in operating income in 2005, resulting in a 4.6% operating margin. KBR revenue
      decreased in 2005 as a result of lower revenue on government services projects
      in the Middle East, while operating income increased $840 million over 2004.
      These results reflect:

-

large
                losses in 2004 on our offshore fixed-price engineering, procurement,
                installation, and commissioning (EPIC) projects that did not recur
                in
                2005, combined with improved profitability on our cost-reimbursable
                engineering projects;

-

award
                fees received for our work in Iraq and the complete resolution of
                disputed
                dining facilities, fuel costs, and other issues, which resulted in
                the
                recording of $103 million of operating income related to our LogCAP
                and
                RIO contracts; and

-

profit
                on newly awarded liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids (GTL),
                or
                gas monetization infrastructure projects, designed to commercialize
                gas
                reserves around the world. Our backlog in these gas monetization
                projects
                was $3.7 billion at December 31,
                2005.

During
      2005, our operations were negatively impacted by several hurricanes in the
      Gulf
      of Mexico. ESG lost approximately $80 million in estimated revenue and
      approximately $45 million in estimated operating income primarily due to the
      temporary suspension of work related to damaged and lost customer rigs. KBR
      also
      incurred $5 million in expenses related to the hurricanes.

We
      achieved our goal of reducing our debt-to-capitalization ratio to the mid-30s.
      We redeemed $500 million of senior notes in April 2005 and paid off $300 million
      of floating rate senior notes that matured in October 2005. Our
      debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2005 was 33%.

The
      outlook for our business is positive. Strong commodity prices, a lack of excess
      oil supply compared to historical up-cycle periods, and continuing strong cash
      flow are driving increased spending plans for our exploration and production
      customers. We believe oil and gas prices will fluctuate in the future, but
      the
      fundamentals that support increased demand for our services or products are
      not
      expected to change significantly in the near term. We also expect continued
      growth in gas monetization projects, a particular strength for KBR. We believe
      the North American market will continue to grow in 2006, and we plan to deploy
      additional capital and labor resources in this market. We also expect regions
      outside North America to grow, particularly in the Middle East, Northern Africa,
      Russia, and the deep-water offshore markets, as we execute our international
      growth and investment strategy.

As
      such,
      in 2006 we are focusing on:

-

improving
                the utilization of our equipment and deploying additional resources
                to
                address the growing demand for our services and
                products;


-

increasing
                pricing (as the market allows) for ESG’s services and products due to
                expected labor and material cost increases and high demand from
                customers;

-

leveraging
                our technologies to provide our customers with the ability to more
                efficiently drill wells and to increase the productivity of those
                wells;

-

capitalizing
                on our strengths in the LNG and GTL markets. Forecasted LNG market
                growth
                remains strong and is expected to grow further. Significant numbers
                of new
                LNG liquefaction plant and LNG receiving terminal projects are proposed
                worldwide and are in various stages of development. Our experience
                in
                providing engineering, design, and construction services in the liquefied
                natural gas industry, particularly liquefaction facilities, positions
                us
                to benefit from the growth we are seeing in this industry;
                and

-

diversifying
                the services of our Government and Infrastructure segment. We expect
                our
                work under the LogCAP contract to see a more rapid decline during
                than we saw in 2005. As a result, we are focused on diversifying
                the
                Government and Infrastructure project portfolio and we continued
                to expand
                our work for the United States Navy under the CONCAP construction
                contingency contract and are positioned for future contingency work
                for
                the United States Air Force under the AFCAP contract. In addition,
                we have
                strengthened our position with the United Kingdom Ministry of
                Defence.

We
      also
      plan to initiate the separation of KBR from Halliburton in 2006. Our decision
      to
      separate KBR arose primarily because we do not believe the full value of KBR
      is
      currently reflected in Halliburton’s stock price, and few synergies exist
      between the two business units. Our current plan is to effect an initial public
      offering (IPO) of less than 20% of KBR. We believe the IPO market is attractive
      and valuation multiples of publicly traded engineering and construction
      companies are currently favorable. In response to interest we have received,
      we
      may consider selling some pieces of KBR, but this is not expected to change
      our
      IPO plans for the remainder of KBR. We expect that a Form S-1 for KBR will
      be
      filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after
      the
      2005 audited financial statements of KBR are complete. Any sale of KBR stock
      would be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and such shares of common
      stock would only be offered and sold by means of a prospectus. This annual
      report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer
      to
      buy any securities of KBR, and there will not be any sale of any such securities
      in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior
      to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such
      state.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up
      to
      $1.0 billion. The Board of Directors approved a dividend for the first quarter
      of 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2006
      of
      $0.15 per share, payable on March 23, 2006 reflecting a dividend increase of
      $0.025 per share. The Board of Directors also approved a 2:1 stock split,
      subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 annual shareholders meeting of
      a
      proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from one
      billion shares to two billion shares. Each shareholder would receive one
      additional share for each outstanding share held by the shareholder on the
      record date for the stock split. The record date will be announced after the
      approval of the increase in authorized shares of common stock.

Detailed
      discussions of our United States government contract work, the Foreign Corrupt
      Practices Act investigations, and our liquidity and capital resources follow.
      Our operating performance is described in “Business Environment and Results of
      Operations” below.

United
      States Government Contract Work

We
      provide substantial work under our government contracts to the United States
      Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. These contracts include
      our worldwide United States Army logistics contracts, known as LogCAP, and
      contracts to rebuild Iraq’s petroleum industry, such as PCO Oil South. Our
      government services revenue related to Iraq totaled approximately $5.4 billion
      in 2005, $7.1 billion in 2004, and $3.6 billion in 2003.


Given
      the
      demands of working in Iraq and elsewhere for the United States government,
      we
      expect that from time to time we will have disagreements or experience
      performance issues with the various government customers for which we work.
      If
      performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government
      retains the right to pursue remedies which could include threatened termination
      or termination, under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated,
      we may not receive award fees under the affected contract, and our ability
      to
      secure future contracts could be adversely affected, although we would receive
      payment for amounts owed for our allowable costs under cost-reimbursable
      contracts. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers
      for
      any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as
      forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or
      debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative
      publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions
      as
      a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry,
      reduce our ability to compete for new contracts, and may also have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
      and
      cash flow.

DCAA
      audit issues

Our
      operations under United States government contracts are regularly reviewed
      and
      audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and other governmental
      agencies. The DCAA serves in an advisory role to our customer. When issues
      are
      found during the governmental agency audit process, these issues are typically
      discussed and reviewed with us. The DCAA then issues an audit report with its
      recommendations to our customer’s contracting officer. In the case of management
      systems and other contract administrative issues, the contracting officer is
      generally with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). We then work
      with
      our customer to resolve the issues noted in the audit report. If our customer
      or
      a government auditor finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract,
      these costs are not reimbursable, or, if already reimbursed, the costs must
      be
      refunded to the customer.

Dining
      facilities (DFAC).

During
      2003, the DCAA raised issues related to our invoicing to the Army Materiel
      Command (AMC) for food services for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel
      in Iraq and Kuwait. During 2004, we received notice from the DCAA that it was
      recommending withholding 19.35% of our DFAC billings relating to subcontracts
      entered into prior to February 2004 until it completed its audits. Approximately
      $213 million had been withheld as of March 31, 2005. Subsequent to February
      2004, we renegotiated our DFAC subcontracts to address the specific issues
      raised by the DCAA and advised the AMC and the DCAA of the new terms of the
      arrangements. We have had no objection by the government to the terms and
      conditions associated with our new DFAC subcontract agreements. On March 31,
      2005, we reached an agreement with the AMC regarding the costs associated with
      the DFAC subcontractors, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion. Under the
      terms of the agreement, the AMC agreed to the DFAC subcontractor costs except
      for $55 million, which it retained from the $213 million previously withheld
      amount. In the second quarter of 2005, the government released the funds to
      KBR.

During
      2005, we reached settlement agreements with all but one subcontractor, Eurest
      Support Services (Cyprus) International Limited, or ESS, and resolved $44
      million of the $55 million disallowed DFAC subcontractor costs. Accordingly,
      we
      paid the amounts due to all subcontractors with whom settlements have been
      finalized, in accordance with the agreement reached with the government, but
      withheld the remaining $11 million pending settlement with ESS. On September
      30,
      2005, ESS filed suit against us alleging various claims associated with its
      performance as a subcontractor in conjunction with our LogCAP contract in Iraq.
      The case was settled during the first quarter of 2006 without material impact
      to
      us.

Fuel.

In
      December 2003, the DCAA issued a preliminary audit report that alleged that
      we
      may have overcharged the Department of Defense by $61 million in importing
      fuel
      into Iraq. The DCAA questioned costs associated with fuel purchases made in
      Kuwait that were more expensive than buying and transporting fuel from Turkey.
      We responded that we had maintained close coordination of the fuel mission
      with
      the Army Corps of Engineers (COE), which was our customer and oversaw the
      project throughout the life of the task orders, and that the COE had directed
      us
      to use the Kuwait sources. After a review, the COE concluded that we obtained
      a
      fair price for the fuel. Nonetheless, Department of Defense officials referred
      the matter to the agency’s inspector general, which we understand commenced an
      investigation.


The
      DCAA
      issued various audit reports related to task orders under the RIO contract
      that
      reported $275 million in questioned and unsupported costs. The majority of
      these
      costs were associated with the humanitarian fuel mission. In these reports,
      the
      DCAA compared fuel costs we incurred during the duration of the RIO contract
      in
      2003 and early 2004 to fuel prices obtained by the Defense Energy Supply Center
      (DESC) in April 2004 when the fuel mission was transferred to that agency.
      During the fourth quarter of 2005, we resolved all outstanding issues related
      to
      the RIO contract with our customer and settled the remaining questioned costs
      under this contract.

Laundry.

Prior to
      the fourth quarter of 2005, we received notice from the DCAA that it recommended
      withholding $18 million of subcontract costs related to the laundry service
      for
      one task order in southern Iraq for which it believes we and our subcontractors
      have not provided adequate levels of documentation supporting the quantity
      of
      the services provided. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the DCAA issued a notice
      to disallow costs totaling approximately $12 million, releasing $6 million
      of
      amounts previously withheld. The $12 million has been withheld from the
      subcontractor. We are working with the DCMA and the subcontractor to resolve
      this issue.

Containers.

In June
      2005, the DCAA recommended withholding certain costs associated with providing
      containerized housing for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel in Iraq.
      Approximately $55 million has been withheld as of December 31, 2005 (down from
      $60 million originally reported because some issues have been resolved). The
      DCAA recommended that the costs be withheld pending receipt of additional
      explanation or documentation to support the subcontract costs. We have provided
      information we believe addresses the concerns raised by the DCAA. None of these
      amounts have been withheld from our subcontractors. We are working with the
      government and our subcontractors to resolve this issue.

Other
      issues.

The DCAA
      is continuously performing audits of costs incurred for the foregoing and other
      services provided by us under our government contracts. During these audits,
      there are likely to be questions raised by the DCAA about the reasonableness
      or
      allowability of certain costs or the quality or quantity of supporting
      documentation. No assurance can be given that the DCAA might not recommend
      withholding some portion of the questioned costs while the issues are being
      resolved with our customer. Because of the intense scrutiny involving our
      government contracts operations, issues raised by the DCAA may be more difficult
      to resolve. We do not believe any potential withholding will have a significant
      or sustained impact on our liquidity.

Investigations

In
      early
      2004, our internal audit function identified a potential $4 million overbilling
      by La Nouvelle Trading & Contracting Company, W.L.L. (La Nouvelle), one of
      our subcontractors under the LogCAP contract in Iraq, for services performed
      during 2003. In accordance with our policy and government regulation, the
      potential overcharge was reported to the Department of Defense Inspector
      General’s office as well as to our customer, the AMC. We reimbursed the AMC to
      cover that potential overbilling while we conducted our own investigation into
      the matter. We subsequently terminated La Nouvelle’s services under the LogCAP
      contract. In October 2004, La Nouvelle filed suit against us alleging $224
      million in damages as a result of its termination. During the second quarter
      of
      2005, this suit was settled without material impact to us. See Note 12 to the
      consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2005, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) issued
      two
      indictments associated with these issues against a former KBR procurement
      manager and a manager of La Nouvelle.

In
      October 2004, we reported to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s
      office that two former employees in Kuwait may have had inappropriate contacts
      with individuals employed by or affiliated with two third-party subcontractors
      prior to the award of the subcontracts. The Inspector General’s office may
      investigate whether these two employees may have solicited and/or accepted
      payments from these third-party subcontractors while they were employed by
      us.

In
      October 2004, a civilian contracting official in the COE asked for a review
      of
      the process used by the COE for awarding some of the contracts to us. We
      understand that the Department of Defense Inspector General’s office may review
      the issues involved.


We
      understand that the DOJ, an Assistant United States Attorney based in Illinois,
      and others are investigating these and other individually immaterial matters
      we
      have reported relating to our government contract work in Iraq. If criminal
      wrongdoing were found, criminal penalties could range up to the greater of
      $500,000 in fines per count for a corporation or twice the gross pecuniary
      gain
      or loss. We also understand that current and former employees of KBR have
      received subpoenas and have given or may give grand jury testimony related
      to
      some of these matters.

Withholding
      of payments

During
      2004, the AMC issued a determination that a particular contract clause could
      cause it to withhold 15% from our invoices until our task orders under the
      LogCAP contract are definitized. The AMC delayed implementation of this
      withholding pending further review. During the third quarter of 2004, we and
      the
      AMC identified three senior management teams to facilitate negotiation under
      the
      LogCAP task orders, and these teams concluded their effort by successfully
      negotiating the final outstanding task order definitization on March 31, 2005.
      This made us current with regard to definitization of historical LogCAP task
      orders and eliminated the potential 15% withholding issue under the LogCAP
      contract.

Upon
      the
      completion of the RIO contract definitization process, the COE released all
      previously withheld amounts related to this contract in the fourth quarter
      of
      2005.

The
      PCO
      Oil South project has definitized substantially all of the task orders, and
      we
      have collected a significant portion of the amounts previously withheld. We
      do
      not believe the withholding will have a significant or sustained impact on
      our
      liquidity because the withholding is temporary, and the definitization process
      is substantially complete.

We
      are
      working diligently with our customers to proceed with significant new work
      only
      after we have a fully definitized task order, which should limit withholdings
      on
      future task orders for all government contracts.

In
      addition, we had probable unapproved claims totaling $69 million at December
      31,
      2005 for the LogCAP and PCO Oil South contracts. These unapproved claims related
      to contracts where our costs have exceeded the customer’s funded value of the
      task order.

DCMA
      system reviews

Report
      on estimating system.

On
      December 27, 2004, the DCMA granted continued approval of our estimating system,
      stating that our estimating system is “acceptable with corrective action.” We
      are in the process of completing these corrective actions. Specifically, based
      on the unprecedented level of support that our employees are providing the
      military in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we needed to update our estimating
      policies and procedures to make them better suited to such contingency
      situations. Additionally, we have completed our development of a detailed
      training program and have made it available to all estimating personnel to
      ensure that employees are adequately prepared to deal with the challenges and
      unique circumstances associated with a contingency operation.

Report
      on purchasing system.

As a
      result of a Contractor Purchasing System Review by the DCMA during the fourth
      quarter of 2005, the DCMA granted the continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system. The DCMA’s approval letter, dated October 28, 2005,
      stated that our purchasing system’s policies and practices are “effective and
      efficient, and provide adequate protection of the Government’s
      interest.”

Report
      on accounting system.

We
      received two draft reports on our accounting system, which raised various issues
      and questions. We have responded to the points raised by the DCAA, but this
      review remains open. Once the DCAA finalizes the report, it will be submitted
      to
      the DCMA, who will make a determination of the adequacy of our accounting
      systems for government contracting.

The
      Balkans

We
      have
      had inquiries in the past by the DCAA and the civil fraud division of the DOJ
      into possible overcharges for work performed during 1996 through 2000 under
      a
      contract in the Balkans, for which inquiry has not yet been completed by the
      DOJ. Based on an internal investigation, we credited our customer approximately
      $2 million during 2000 and 2001 related to our work in the Balkans as a result
      of billings for which support was not readily available. We believe that the
      preliminary DOJ inquiry relates to potential overcharges in connection with
      a
      part of the Balkans contract under which approximately $100 million in work
      was
      done. We believe that any allegations of overcharges would be without merit.
      Amounts accrued related to this matter as of December 31, 2005 are not
      material.


Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into payments made in connection with
      the
      construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a multibillion dollar natural
      gas liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
      Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related criminal investigation. The
      government has also issued a subpoena to Halliburton seeking information, which
      we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection with
      multiple projects or services over the past 20 years located both in and outside
      of Nigeria in which The M .W. Kellogg Company, M. W. Kellogg, Ltd., Kellogg
      Brown & Root or their joint ventures, as well as the Halliburton energy
      services business, were participants. M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. is a joint venture
      in
      which Kellogg Brown & Root has a 55% interest. The M. W. Kellogg Company was
      a subsidiary of Dresser Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser
      Industries and was later merged with a subsidiary of ours to form Kellogg Brown
      & Root.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). We have been cooperating
      with the SEC and the DOJ, as well as with investigations into the Bonny Island
      project in France and Nigeria. Our Board of Directors has appointed a committee
      of independent directors to oversee and direct the FCPA
      investigations.

The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries (which included M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. and The M .W. Kellogg
      Company)) and include TSKJ’s use of a Japanese trading company that contracted
      to provide services to TSKJ. We have produced documents to the SEC and the
      DOJ
      both voluntarily and pursuant to subpoenas, and we are making our employees
      available to the SEC and the DOJ for interviews. In addition, we understand
      that
      the SEC has issued a subpoena to A. Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a
      consultant and chairman of KBR, and to others, including certain current and
      former KBR employees and at least one subcontractor of KBR. We further
      understand that the DOJ has invoked its authority under a sitting grand jury
      to
      issue subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we
      understand that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ
      and
      the SEC with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
      subpoenas.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (an affiliate of ENI
      SpA
      of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (as successor
      to The M. W. Kellogg Company), each of which owns 25% of the venture. TSKJ
      and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA).
      Commencing in 1995, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements in
      connection with the Bonny Island project, including with Tri-Star Investments,
      of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal. We understand that a French magistrate
      has officially placed Mr. Tesler under investigation for corruption of a foreign
      public official. In Nigeria, a legislative committee of the National Assembly
      and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is organized as part
      of
      the executive branch of the government, are also investigating these matters.
      Our representatives have met with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials.
      In October 2004, representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the
      Nigerian legislative committee.

As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe, based on the ongoing governmental and
      other investigations, that payments may have been made to Nigerian
      officials.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements.

In
      June
      2004, we terminated all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant
      and former employee of M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. The terminations occurred because
      of
      violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved the receipt
      of improper personal benefits in connection with TSKJ’s construction of the
      natural gas liquefaction facility in Nigeria.


Until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding compliance with
      applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct, we have also suspended the
      services of another agent who has worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several
      current projects and on numerous older projects going back to the early 1980’s.
      In addition, we are actively reviewing the compliance of an additional agent
      on
      a separate current Nigerian project with respect to which we have recently
      received from a joint venture partner on that project allegations of wrongful
      payments made by such agent.

In
      February 2005, TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would
      not
      oppose the Attorney General’s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in
      banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria and to have the legal ownership
      of
      such sums determined in the Nigerian courts.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement, and injunctive relief. Criminal penalties
      could range up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss.

Both
      the
      SEC and the DOJ could argue that continuing conduct may constitute multiple
      violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts per
      violation.

Often,
      agreed dispositions for these types of matters result in a monitor being
      appointed by the SEC and/or the DOJ to review future business and practices
      with
      the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA. Fines and civil and criminal
      penalties could be mitigated, in the government’s discretion, depending on the
      level of the cooperation in the investigations.

Potential
      consequences of a criminal indictment arising out of these matters could include
      suspension by the Department of Defense or another federal, state, or local
      government agency of KBR and its affiliates from their ability to contract
      with
      United States, state or local governments, or government agencies and, if a
      criminal or civil violation were found, KBR and its affiliates could be debarred
      from future contracts or new orders under current contracts to provide services
      to any such parties. During 2005, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $6.6 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. Consistent with our cooperation
      with the DOJ and the SEC, we would seek to obtain administrative agreements
      or
      waivers to avoid suspension or debarment. Generally, debarments can last up
      to
      three years. Suspension or debarment from the government contracts business
      would have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations
      of KBR and Halliburton.

There
      can
      be no assurance that any governmental investigation or our investigation of
      these matters will not conclude that violations of applicable laws have
      occurred. The results of these investigations could have a material adverse
      effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition,
      and cash flows.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we have not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments made in connection with the
      Nigerian project, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and
      other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one or
      more
      competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such coordination
      possibly began as early as the mid-1980s, which was significantly before our
      1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries.

On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Suspension or debarment from contracting
      with the United States, state or local governments, or government agencies
      could
      also occur. Criminal prosecutions under applicable laws of relevant foreign
      jurisdictions and civil claims by or relationship issues with customers are
      also
      possible.

There
      can
      be no assurance that the results of these investigations will not have a
      material adverse effect on our business and results of
      operations.


As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We
      ended
      2005 with cash and equivalents of $2.4 billion compared to $1.9 billion at
      December 31, 2004.

Significant
      sources of cash

Cash
      flows from operations contributed $701 million to cash in 2005. We received
      approximately $1.032 billion in asbestos- and silica-related insurance proceeds
      in 2005 and expect to receive additional amounts as follows:

Millions
                of dollars

Total

$


During
      the first quarter of 2005, we sold $891 million in investments in marketable
      securities. Our cash flow was supplemented by approximately $200 million from
      the sale of our 50% interest in Subsea 7, Inc. in January 2005 and $85 million
      from the sale of an investment in a United States toll road in September
      2005.

Our
      working capital requirements for our Iraq-related work, excluding cash and
      equivalents, decreased from $700 million at December 31, 2004 to $495 million
      at
      December 31, 2005.

Further
      available sources of cash.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2005, we entered into an unsecured $1.2 billion five-year
      revolving credit facility for general working capital purposes. The new credit
      facility replaced our secured $700 million three-year revolving credit facility
      and our secured $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility. The letter
      of
      credit issued under the previous secured $700 million three-year revolving
      credit facility is now under our unsecured $1.2 billion revolving facility
      and
      has a balance of $107 million as of December 31, 2005. The letter of credit
      reduces the availability under the revolving credit facility to approximately
      $1.1 billion. There were no cash drawings under the unsecured $1.2 billion
      revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2005.

KBR
      entered into an unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility
      in
      the fourth quarter of 2005. Three letters of credit that totaled $25 million
      were subsequently issued under the KBR revolving credit facility, thus reducing
      the availability under the credit facility to approximately $825 million at
      December 31, 2005. There were no cash drawings under the unsecured $850 million
      revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2005.

Significant
      uses of cash

In
      2005,
      we used approximately $2.4 billion to fund the asbestos and silica liability
      trusts and made the following payments:

On
      April
      26, 2005, we redeemed, at par plus accrued interest, all $500 million of our
      floating rate senior notes due 2007 that were issued in January 2004. On October
      17, 2005, we repaid, at par plus accrued interest, our $300 million floating
      rate senior notes that matured.

Capital
      expenditures of $651 million in 2005 were 13% higher than in 2004. Capital
      spending in 2005 continued to be primarily directed to the Energy Services
      Group
      for the Production Optimization, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, and Fluid
      Systems segments.

We
      paid
      $254 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2005.

We
      also
      continued to fund operating cash shortfalls on the Barracuda-Caratinga project,
      a multiyear construction project to develop the Barracuda and Caratinga crude
      oilfields off the coast of Brazil. During 2005, we funded approximately $169
      million, net of revenue received. This amount was net of payments to us of
      $138
      million related to change orders.

Future
      uses of cash.

The
      following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other
      long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2005:

Long-term
      debt excludes the effect of a terminated interest rate swap of approximately
      $2
      million.

(2)

Long-term
      debt includes a silica note contributed to the trust for the benefit of silica
      personal injury claimants. Subsequent to the initial payment of $15 million,
      the
      silica note provides that we will contribute an amount to the silica trust
      at
      the end of each year for the next 30 years of up to $15 million. The note also
      provides for an extension of the note for 20 additional years under certain
      circumstances. We initially recorded the note at our estimated amount of
      approximately $24 million, including the initial payment of $15 million paid
      in
      January 2005. We will periodically reassess our valuation of this note based
      upon our projections of the amounts we believe we will be required to fund
      into
      the silica trust. Long-term debt also includes an asbestos insurance
      partitioning agreement that we reached in 2004 with Federal-Mogul, our insurance
      companies, and another party sharing in the insurance coverage to obtain their
      consent and support of a partitioning of the insurance policies. As part of
      the
      settlement, we agreed to pay $46 million in three installment payments. In
      2004,
      we accrued $44 million, which represents the present value of the $46 million
      to
      be paid. The discount is accreted as interest expense (classified as
      discontinued operations) over the life of the expected future cash payments
      beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. The first payment of $16 million was
      paid in January 2005, and the second payment of $15 million was paid in January
      2006. The third and final payment of $15 million will be made in January
      2007.

The
      purchase obligations disclosed above do not include purchase obligations that
      KBR enters into with its vendors in the normal course of business that support
      existing contracting arrangements with its customers. The purchase obligations
      with their vendors can span several years depending on the duration of the
      projects. In general, the costs associated with the purchase obligations are
      expensed as the revenue is earned on the related projects.

(4)

In
      order
      to mitigate a portion of the projected underfunding of our United Kingdom
      pension plans, ESG contributed $38 million and KBR contributed $74 million
      in
      February 2006. These amounts are included in the $164 million 2006 funding
      obligation.

Capital
      spending for 2006 is expected to be approximately $875 million. The capital
      expenditures budget for 2006 includes a steady level of activities related
      to
      our DML shipyard and increased spending in the Energy Services Group to
      accommodate higher activity levels.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up
      to
      $1.0 billion. The Board of Directors also approved a dividend for the first
      quarter of 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March
      2,
      2006 of $0.15 per share, payable on March 23, 2006, reflecting a dividend
      increase of $0.025 per share.


As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had commitments to fund approximately $79 million to
      related companies. These commitments arose primarily during the start-up of
      these entities or due to losses incurred by them. We expect approximately $61
      million of the commitments to be paid during 2006.

We
      continue to fund operating cash shortfalls on the Barracuda-Caratinga project
      and are obligated to fund total shortages over the remaining project life.
      We
      expect the remaining project costs, net of revenue to be received, to be
      approximately $12 million.

Other
      factors affecting liquidity

Accounts
      receivable securitization facilities.

In May
      2004, we entered into an agreement to sell, assign, and transfer the entire
      title and interest in specified United States government accounts receivable
      of
      KBR to a third party. The total amount of receivables outstanding under this
      agreement as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $263 million. As of December
      31, 2005, these receivables were collected, the balance was retired, and the
      facility was terminated.

In
      April
      2002, we entered into an agreement to sell eligible United States Energy
      Services Group accounts receivable to a bankruptcy-remote limited-purpose
      funding subsidiary. As of December 31, 2004, we had sold $256 million of
      undivided ownership interest to unaffiliated companies. During the fourth
      quarter of 2005, these receivables were collected and the balance retired.
      No
      further receivables were sold, and the facility was terminated subsequent to
      December 31, 2005.

See
“Off
      Balance Sheet Risk” below for further discussion regarding these
      facilities.

Letters
      of credit.

In the
      normal course of business, we have agreements with banks under which
      approximately $1.2 billion of letters of credit or bank guarantees were
      outstanding as of December 31, 2005, including $434 million that relate to
      our
      joint ventures’ operations. Also included in the letters of credit outstanding
      as of December 31, 2005 were $183 million of performance letters of credit
      and
      $114 million of retainage letters of credit related to the Barracuda-Caratinga
      project. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that
      would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization.

Credit
      ratings.

Our
      current ratings are BBB on Standard & Poor’s and Baa1 on Moody’s Investors
      Service. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Moody’s revised its long-term senior
      unsecured debt rating from Baa2 to Baa1 with a “stable” outlook. In the third
      quarter of 2005, Standard & Poor’s revised its credit watch listing for us
      from “stable” to “positive,” citing improved operating performance and debt
      reduction as reasons for the upgrade. In the first quarter of 2005, Standard
      & Poor’s revised its credit watch listing for us from “developing” to
“stable” and its short-term credit and commercial paper rating from A-3 to A-2.
      Our Moody’s Investors Service short-term credit and commercial paper rating is
      P-2.

Debt
      covenants.

Letters
      of credit related to our Barracuda-Caratinga project and our $1.2 billion
      revolving credit facility contain restrictive covenants, including covenants
      that require us to maintain financial ratios as defined by the agreements.
      For
      the letters of credit related to our Barracuda-Caratinga project, we are
      required to maintain interest coverage and leverage ratios. We are also required
      to maintain a minimum debt-to-capitalization ratio under our $1.2 billion
      revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with
      these requirements.

In
      addition, the unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility entered
      into by KBR contains covenants including a limitation on the amount KBR can
      invest in unconsolidated subsidiaries. KBR must also maintain financial ratios
      including a debt-to-capitalization ratio, a leverage ratio, and a fixed charge
      coverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, KBR was in compliance with these
      requirements.


BUSINESS
      ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We
      currently operate in about 100 countries throughout the world, where we provide
      a comprehensive range of discrete and integrated services and products to the
      energy industry and to other industrial and governmental customers. The majority
      of our consolidated revenue is derived from the sale of services and products
      to
      major, national, and independent oil and gas companies and governments around
      the world. The services and products provided to major, national, and
      independent oil and gas companies are used throughout the energy industry from
      the earliest phases of exploration, development, and production of oil and
      gas
      through refining, processing, and marketing. Our six business segments are
      organized around how we manage the business: Production Optimization, Fluid
      Systems, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, Digital and Consulting Solutions,
      Government and Infrastructure, and Energy and Chemicals. We refer to the
      combination of Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation
      Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions segments as the ESG, and the
      combination of Government and Infrastructure and Energy and Chemicals as
      KBR.

The
      industries we serve are highly competitive with many substantial competitors
      for
      each segment. In 2005, based upon the location of the services provided and
      products sold, 27% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States,
      24%
      of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq, primarily related to work for the
      United States Government, and 10% of our consolidated revenue was from the
      United Kingdom. In 2004, 26% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq, and
      22%
      of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. In 2003, 27% of our
      consolidated revenue was from the United States, and 15% of our consolidated
      revenue was from Iraq. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our
      revenue during these periods.

Operations
      in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
      acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict,
      expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, exchange controls,
      or
      currency devaluation. Except for our government services work in Iraq discussed
      above, we believe the geographic diversification of our business activities
      reduces the risk that loss of operations in any one country would be material
      to
      our consolidated results of operations.

Activity
      levels within our business segments are significantly impacted by the
      following:

-

spending
                on upstream exploration, development, and production programs by
                major,
                national, and independent oil and gas
                companies;

-

capital
                expenditures for downstream refining, processing, petrochemical,
                gas
                monetization, and marketing facilities by major, national, and independent
                oil and gas companies; and

-

government
                spending levels.

Also
      impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil
      and gas consumption, demand for petrochemical products, and investment in
      infrastructure projects.

Some
      of
      the more significant barometers of current and future spending levels of oil
      and
      gas companies are oil and gas prices, exploration and production spending by
      international and national oil companies, the world economy, and global
      stability, which together drive worldwide drilling activity. Our ESG financial
      performance is significantly affected by oil and gas prices and worldwide rig
      activity, which are summarized in the following tables.

Our
      customers’ cash flows, in many instances, depend upon the revenue they generate
      from the sale of oil and gas. Higher oil and gas prices usually translate into
      higher exploration and production budgets. Higher prices also improve the
      economic attractiveness of marginal exploration areas. This drives additional
      investment by our customers in the sector, which benefits us. The opposite
      is
      true for lower oil and gas prices.

Over
      2005, United States oil prices continued their upward trend, leveling off in
      the
      high-$50 per barrel range by year-end. Recent increases in crude oil prices
      are
      due to a combination of the following factors:

-

growth
                in worldwide petroleum demand remains robust, despite high oil
                prices;

-

projected
                growth in non-Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (non-OPEC)
                supplies is not expected to accommodate worldwide demand
                growth;

-

worldwide
                spare crude oil production capacity has recently diminished and is
                projected to remain low;

-

downstream
                sectors, such as refining and shipping, are expected to keep the
                level of
                uncertainty in world oil markets high as there is limited refining
                capacity available, particularly in the United States;
                and

-

loss
                of additional capacity due to recent hurricanes in an already tight
                refining market.


The
      Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts prices for crude oil,
      petroleum products, and natural gas to remain high through 2006. The EIA
      projects West Texas Intermediate prices to average $63 per barrel in 2006 and
      $60 per barrel in 2007.

United
      States natural gas prices also continued to move higher in 2005. Despite
      adequate natural gas storage, high natural gas prices are expected to persist
      through 2006 according to Spears and Associates.

Heightened
      energy demand coupled with high petroleum and natural gas prices in 2005
      contributed to a 15% increase in average worldwide rig count compared to 2004.
      This increase was primarily driven by the United States rig count, which grew
      16% year-over-year. Our ESG revenue in the United States grew 36% year-over-year
      on this 16% rig count increase. Land gas drilling in the United States rose
      substantially, as gas prices remained high due to economic demand growth and
      higher fuel oil prices that discouraged switching to a lower-priced fuel source
      to minimize cost. Average Canadian rig counts increased 24% in 2005 compared
      to
      2004. Outside of North America, average rig counts primarily increased in Latin
      America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, with most of the increase related
      to
      oil drilling.

In
      December 2005, Spears and Associates predicted that the United States average
      rig count in 2006 will increase 13% over 2005. Canadian and international
      average rig counts in 2006 are forecasted to rise 30% and 5%, respectively,
      over
      2005. Many new land rigs are expected to enter the industry, as 2006 spending
      to
      drill and complete new wells is projected to increase more than 20% over
      2005.

It
      is
      common practice in the United States oilfield services industry to sell services
      and products based on a price book and then apply discounts to the price book
      based upon a variety of factors. The discounts applied typically increase to
      partially or substantially offset price book increases in the weeks immediately
      following a price increase. The discount applied normally decreases over time
      if
      the activity levels remain strong. During periods of reduced activity, discounts
      normally increase, reducing the revenue for our services and, conversely, during
      periods of higher activity, discounts normally decline resulting in revenue
      increasing for our services.

In
      and 2005, we implemented several United States price book increases ranging
      from
      5% to 18%, led by our pressure pumping services. We realized some of the
      benefits of these price book increases in 2005, and we expect further
      improvements during 2006. In addition, a price book increase of 5% for software
      products in our Digital and Consulting Solutions segment was implemented in
      January 2006. We anticipate that further price increases will be needed to
      offset the impact of inflationary pressures in our cost base.

Overall
      outlook.

The
      outlook for world oil demand continues to remain strong, with China and North
      America accounting for approximately 45% of the expected demand growth in 2006.
      Chinese demand growth has declined recently, although oil demand growth is
      continuing in other populous countries, including India and Indonesia. Excess
      oil production capacity is expected to remain constrained and that, along with
      strong demand, is expected to keep supplies tight. Thus, any unexpected supply
      disruption or change in demand could lead to fluctuating prices. The
      International Energy Agency forecasts world petroleum demand growth in 2006
      to
      increase 2% over 2005.

Our
      business is well-positioned in the United States. One of our fastest growing
      operations in this region is production enhancement, where we help our customers
      optimize the production rates from the wells by providing stimulation services.
      Among the other opportunities we expect is the recovery in deepwater drilling.
      Although overall rigs in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to decrease in 2006,
      demand for rigs to drill in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico is increasing.
      Despite having downsized our Gulf of Mexico operations due to its downturn
      in
      2002-2003, we continue to have a significant presence in the area and are
      positioned to meet increasing customer demand. However, the Gulf of Mexico
      operations have been and can continue to be adversely affected by the hurricane
      season, which lasts from June through November. In the last half of 2005, four
      hurricanes adversely affected the Gulf of Mexico operations and some shut-in
      production remains. We expect customers to continue resuming activity in the
      Gulf of Mexico into the first half of 2006. These opportunities could be
      affected by sustained lower gas prices in the United States, which would reduce
      rig counts and activity in our production enhancement and other
      services.

In
      2005,
      we were able to leverage our global infrastructure to increase the share of
      our
      business that comes from outside of the United States, as evidenced by a 20%
      increase over 2004 in ESG’s international revenue on a 13% increase in
      international rig count. Canada experienced tremendous activity growth in the
      latter half of 2005 and is expected to sustain growth in 2006.


In
      our
      Middle East/Asia region, Saudi Arabia is working to increase production and
      has
      increased its demand for oil services. Our 51%-owned subsidiary, WellDynamics,
      is currently supplying intelligent well completions in the region. Our
      involvement in Oman and Indonesia has expanded as a result of numerous multiyear
      contracts to provide an array of fluid, drilling, and logging services, as
      well
      as cementing, stimulation, and completion tools services. In 2005, our Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation, Fluid Systems, and Production Optimization segments
      also had new contract start-ups in Malaysia and Thailand. We have mobilized
      additional service equipment and personnel to the region to meet the overall
      rig
      and exploration and production demand, and we expect to see continued growth
      in
      these markets.

In
      our
      Europe/Africa/CIS region, strengthening demand in northern and western Africa
      and the North Sea has improved our asset utilization in all of our oilfield
      service product lines, and we are positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.
      In Libya, for example, we were recently awarded a four-well hydraulic fracturing
      contract that required a sharing of resources with a neighboring operation
      in
      Egypt and technical support from Europe. The successful completion of this
      contract has triggered new opportunities with customers in Libya. Our
      involvement in Russia is expanding as we believe that the business environment
      from a risk perspective has improved from a year ago. Landmark was recently
      awarded a software maintenance and support contract in Russia, and our field
      development work in Western Siberia was recently expanded to include services
      from our Fluid Systems and Drilling and Formation Evaluation segments. Awards
      during 2005 in Azerbaijan in our Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment
      and
      in northern Kazakhstan in our Drilling and Formation Evaluation, Fluid Systems,
      and Production Optimization segments will further improve our position in the
      Caspian as this area expands its demand for oilfield services. In Angola, where
      demand is driven by deepwater development, our Fluid Systems and Production
      Optimization segments were awarded contracts in 2005 and are actively pursuing
      more.

In
      Latin
      America, our overall performance has improved from a year ago. Despite the
      early
      problems with our fixed-price, turnkey drilling projects in southern Mexico,
      margins have improved, and we expect to complete them in the spring of 2006.
      In
      2005, our Fluid Systems segment had new contract start-ups in Colombia and
      Ecuador, and in Argentina our Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment began
      work on new logging and drilling services contracts.

Finally,
      technology is an important aspect of our business, and we continue to focus
      on
      the development, introduction, and application of new technologies. See Note
      to the consolidated financial statements for information about our research
      and
      development expense in the last three years. We expect our 2006 investment
      in
      new technology to increase compared to our 2005 investment.

KBR

KBR
      provides a wide range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers
      and government entities worldwide. KBR’s customer base includes leading
      international oil and gas companies, national oil and gas companies, independent
      refiners, chemical producers, fertilizer producers, and domestic and foreign
      government entities. KBR projects are generally longer-term in nature than
      our
      ESG work and are impacted by more diverse drivers than short-term fluctuations
      in oil and gas prices and drilling activities, such as local economic cycles,
      introduction of new governmental regulation, and governmental outsourcing of
      services. Demand for KBR’s services depends primarily on customers’ capital
      expenditures for construction and defense services. KBR is currently benefiting
      from historically high crude oil and natural gas prices and general global
      economic expansion, primarily in the petroleum and petrochemical industries.
      Additionally, the heightened focus on domestic security, increased military
      operations and maintenance spending, and a global expansion in government
      outsourcing have all contributed to the growth of our business.

Effective
      October 1, 2004, we restructured KBR into two segments, Government and
      Infrastructure and Energy and Chemicals. As a result of the reorganization
      and
      in a continued effort to better position KBR for the future, we made several
      strategic organizational changes. We eliminated certain internal expenditures
      and took appropriate steps to streamline the entire organization. KBR’s results
      for 2005 reflect cost savings related to the restructuring.


Our
      Government and Infrastructure segment provides support services to military
      and
      civilian branches of governments throughout the world. Our most significant
      contract is the worldwide United States Army logistics contract, known as
      LogCAP. We were awarded the competitively bid LogCAP contract in December 2001
      from the AMC to provide worldwide United States Army logistics services. The
      contract is a one-year contract with nine one-year renewal options. We are
      currently in year five of the contract. The AMC can terminate, reduce the amount
      of work, or replace our contract with a new competitively bid contract at any
      time during the term of the contract.

During
      the second quarter of 2005, a large task order was assigned for the next phase
      of work under the LogCAP contract in Iraq and replaces several task orders
      that
      are nearing completion. Despite this award, we expect the volume of work under
      our LogCAP contract to continue to decline into 2006, as our customer scales
      back the amount of services that we provide. In order to diversify our
      government services portfolio, we continue to expand our work for the United
      States Navy under the CONCAP construction contingency contract, the United
      States Air Force under the AFCAP contract, and the United Kingdom Ministry
      of
      Defence. In addition, KBR was recently awarded the competitively bid Indefinite
      Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to support the Department of Homeland
      Security’s United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in the
      event of an emergency. This contract has a five-year term, consisting of a
      one-year base period and four one-year options.

In
      the
      civil infrastructure sector, there has been a general trend of historic
      under-investment. In particular, infrastructure related to the quality of water,
      wastewater, roads and transit, airports, and educational facilities has declined
      while demand for expanded and improved infrastructure continues to outpace
      funding. As a result, we expect increased opportunities for our engineering
      and
      construction services and for our privately financed project activities as
      our
      financing structures make us an attractive partner for state and local
      governments undertaking important infrastructure projects.

Our
      Energy and Chemicals segment develops energy and chemical projects throughout
      the world, including LNG and GTL gas monetization facilities, refineries,
      petrochemical plants, offshore oil and gas production platforms, and synthesis
      gas facilities. The major focus is on our gas monetization work. Forecasted
      LNG
      market growth remains strong and is expected to grow rapidly, with demand
      projected to double through 2015. Significant numbers of new LNG liquefaction
      plant and LNG receiving terminal projects are proposed worldwide and are in
      various stages of development. Committed LNG liquefaction engineering,
      procurement, and construction (EPC) projects will yield substantial growth
      in
      worldwide LNG liquefaction capacity. This trend is expected to continue through
      2007 and beyond. Our extensive experience in providing engineering, design,
      and
      construction services in the liquefied natural gas industry, particularly
      liquefaction facilities, positions us to benefit from the growth we are seeing
      in this industry.

In
      March
      2005, KBR, with a 50% ownership, and its joint venture partners were awarded
      a
      gas monetization contract valued at $1.8 billion for the engineering,
      procurement, construction, and commissioning of the Tangguh LNG facility in
      Indonesia. In April 2005, KBR, with a 50% ownership, and a joint venture partner
      were also awarded an EPC contract valued at $1.7 billion for a GTL facility
      in
      Escravos, Nigeria. Also in April 2005, KBR and its joint venture partners were
      awarded a front end engineering and design contract (FEED) encompassing offshore
      and onshore operations to monetize significant gas resources from fields located
      offshore Angola. In July 2005, KBR and our joint venture partners were awarded
      a
      cost reimbursable FEED contract and an option for a cost reimbursable
      engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) contract for the
      greater Gorgon Downstream LNG Project in Western Australia. In August 2005,
      KBR
      renewed an alliance with one of its joint venture partners in order to build
      upon their respective strengths and work together to pursue and execute the
      engineering and construction of LNG and GTL projects around the world. In
      September 2005, this joint venture was awarded a project management contract
      for
      a GTL project in Qatar. In September 2005, KBR, with a 33% ownership, and its
      joint venture partners were also awarded a lump-sum turnkey contract valued
      at
      more than $2.0 billion to provide engineering, procurement, construction,
      pre-commissioning, commissioning, start-up, and operations services for Yemen’s
      first LNG plant. At December 31, 2005, we had $3.7 billion in backlog related
      to
      major gas monetization projects.

In
      order
      to meet growing energy demands, oil and gas companies are increasing their
      exploration, production, and transportation spending to increase production
      capacity and supply. KBR is currently targeting reimbursable EPC and EPCM
      opportunities in northern and western Africa, the Caspian area, Asia Pacific,
      Latin America, and the North Sea.


Outsourcing
      of operations and maintenance work by industrial and energy companies has been
      increasing worldwide. Opportunities in this area are anticipated as the aging
      infrastructure in United States refineries and chemical plants requires more
      maintenance and repairs to minimize production downtime. More stringent industry
      safety standards and environmental regulations also lead to higher maintenance
      standards and costs.

Contract
      structure.

Engineering and construction contracts can be broadly categorized as either
      cost-reimbursable or fixed-price, sometimes referred to as lump sum. Some
      contracts can involve both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
      elements.

Fixed-price
      contracts are for a fixed sum to cover all costs and any profit element for
      a
      defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us as we must
      predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs
      associated with executing the work. While fixed-price contracts involve greater
      risk, they also are potentially more profitable for the contractor, since the
      owner/customer pays a premium to transfer many risks to the
      contractor.

Cost-reimbursable
      contracts include contracts where the price is variable based upon our actual
      costs incurred for time and materials, or for variable quantities of work priced
      at defined unit rates. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be based upon
      a
      percentage of costs incurred and/or a fixed amount. Cost-reimbursable contracts
      are generally less risky, since the owner/customer retains many of the
      risks.

We
      are
      continuing with our strategy to move away from offshore fixed-price EPIC
      contracts within our Energy and Chemicals segment. We have only two remaining
      major fixed-price EPIC offshore projects. As of December 31, 2005, they were
      substantially complete.

The
      increase in consolidated revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable
      to
      increased revenue from our Energy Services Group, predominantly resulting from
      increased activity, higher utilization of our equipment, and our ability to
      raise prices due to higher exploration and production spending by our customers.
      This was partially offset by reduced activity in our government services
      projects, primarily in the Middle East, the winding down of offshore fixed-price
      EPIC operations, and other oil and gas projects nearing completion.
      Additionally, $80 million in estimated revenue was lost during 2005 due to
      Gulf
      of Mexico hurricanes. International revenue was 73% of consolidated revenue
      in
      2005 and 78% of consolidated revenue in 2004, with the decrease primarily due
      to
      the decline of our government services projects abroad. Revenue from the United
      States Government for all geographic areas was approximately $6.6 billion or
      31%
      of consolidated revenue in 2005 compared to $8.0 billion or 39% of consolidated
      revenue in 2004.

The
      increase in consolidated operating income was primarily due to stronger
      performance in our Energy Services Group resulting from improved demand due
      to
      increased rig activity and improved pricing and asset utilization. KBR’s
      operating income increased primarily due to the resolution of disputed fuel
      costs and other issues as a result of favorable settlement of government audits,
      improved project execution, and savings from KBR’s restructuring plan. Partially
      offsetting the consolidated operating income increase was an estimated $50
      million adverse impact of Gulf of Mexico hurricanes in 2005, $45 million of
      which related to ESG and $5 million of which related to KBR.

In
      2005,
      Iraq-related work contributed approximately $5.4 billion to consolidated revenue
      and $172 million to consolidated operating income, a 3.2% margin before
      corporate costs and taxes.

Following
      is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable segment.

Production
      Optimization

increase
      in revenue compared to 2004 was derived from all regions. Production enhancement
      services revenue grew 37% largely driven by United States onshore operations
      due
      to strong demand for stimulation services coupled with improved equipment
      utilization and pricing. Higher rig activity in Canada and offshore Angola
      and
      increased equipment sales to China also contributed to production enhancement
      services revenue growth. Revenue from sales of completion tools increased 12%
      compared to 2004, benefiting from improved completions and perforating sales
      in
      Angola, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and increased underbalanced
      applications and perforating activity in southern Mexico. These improvements
      were partially offset by declines in the Caspian where completions, drill stem
      test, and reservoir information contracts concluded in 2004 and early 2005.
      WellDynamics revenue more than doubled in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a large
      contract for intelligent well completions in the Middle East. Our Subsea 7,
      Inc.
      joint venture, which was sold in January 2005, contributed $2 million equity
      income in 2004. International revenue was 49% of total segment revenue in 2005
      compared to 54% in 2004.

The
      increase in segment operating income in 2005 included a $110 million gain on
      the
      sale in 2005 of our equity interest in the Subsea 7, Inc. joint venture,
      partially offset by a $54 million gain on the sale of our surface well testing
      operations in 2004. The segment operating income improvement spanned all
      regions. Production enhancement services operating income increased 81% largely
      due to higher land rig activity and improved utilization of resources in the
      United States, as well as higher utilization of marine vessels offshore Angola.
      A 44% improvement in completion tools operating income primarily resulted from
      a
      general increase in sales and activity in the United States and higher
      completions and perforating activity in West Africa and the United Kingdom.
      WellDynamics had operating income in 2005 compared to breakeven in 2004,
      primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and improved customer
      acceptance of its intelligent well completions technology. Subsea 7, Inc.
      contributed $2 million equity income to segment results in 2004. Hurricanes
      in
      the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 negatively impacted Production Optimization operating
      income by an estimated $14 million.

Fluid
      Systems

revenue
      increase compared to 2004 was driven by 24% growth in cementing services revenue
      and 21% growth in Baroid Fluid Services revenue. All geographic regions yielded
      increased revenue in both product service lines, with the largest increase
      in
      the United States due to higher onshore rig activity and higher deepwater rig
      activity in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as improved utilization and pricing.
      Sales of cementing services also improved due to increased activity in Canada
      and the North Sea and new contract start-ups in Indonesia. Baroid Fluid Services
      further benefited from increased activity in Angola, Indonesia, and the United
      Kingdom. International revenue was 55% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared
      to 58% in 2004.


Fluid
      Systems segment operating income increase compared to 2004 resulted from 62%
      growth from Baroid Fluid Services and 54% growth in operating income from
      cementing services. Baroid Fluid Services operating income benefited primarily
      from increased activity and improved pricing in the United States and increased
      activity and an improved product mix in Africa. Cementing services results
      increased predominantly in North America due to increased activity and improved
      pricing and asset utilization and in all other geographic regions due to
      generally higher global drilling activity. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
      in
      2005 negatively impacted Fluid Systems operating income by an estimated $25
      million.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

revenue
      increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was derived from all four regions in every
      product service line. The segment improvement was led by a 30% increase in
      drilling services revenue, particularly in North America due to improved
      pricing, higher rig activity, and new contract awards. Increased international
      activity, new contract start-ups, and expanded GeoPilot® services contributed to
      other region revenue increases, especially evident in the North Sea, the Middle
      East, and Latin America. Drill bits revenue increased 26% compared to 2004,
      largely benefiting from increased rig counts, improved pricing, and increased
      sales of fixed cutter bits in the United States. Logging services revenue grew
      22% primarily due to increased cased hole activity and improved pricing in
      the
      United States, sales to India of logging equipment, and new contract awards
      in
      West Africa and the Middle East. Lower sales of logging equipment to China
      in
      2005 partially offset the logging services revenue improvement. International
      revenue was 71% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared to 72% in
      2004.

The
      segment operating income increase compared to 2004 spanned all geographic
      regions in all product service lines, with North America as the predominant
      contributor due to improved pricing, increased rig activity, and growth in
      higher margin services. Drill bits operating income in 2005 was nearly five
      times that of 2004, the majority of which occurred in North America. Drilling
      services operating income doubled from 2004 to 2005, resulting from increased
      global activity, improved utilization and pricing, and continued customer
      acceptance of GeoPilot® and other high margin services. Equipment sales in
      Nigeria also contributed to drilling services operating income increase. Logging
      services results grew 76%, additionally benefiting from higher activity in
      West
      Africa and the Middle East and sales of logging equipment to India. The increase
      in segment operating income included a $24 million gain related to a patent
      infringement case settlement. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005
      negatively impacted Drilling and Formation Evaluation operating income by an
      estimated $6 million.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

revenue
      increase in 2005 was largely driven by project management services, with 40%
      revenue growth due to increased activity in Mexico and higher commodity prices
      in the United States, partially offset by the winding down of projects in the
      Middle East and Russia. Landmark revenue increased 13% in 2005 due to data
      bank
      project growth primarily in Nigeria, increased consulting, and higher sales
      and
      services in Algeria, partially offset by nonrecurring sales in India in 2004.
      International revenue was 73% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared to
      69%
      in 2004.

The
      segment operating income improvement partially resulted from a 77% increase
      in
      Landmark operating income due to stronger software and service sales. Included
      in the 2005 results was a $17 million favorable insurance settlement related
      to
      a pipe fabrication and laying project in the North Sea. This was offset by
      $23
      million in losses in 2005 on two fixed-price integrated solutions projects
      in
      Mexico, reflecting increased costs to complete the projects and longer drilling
      times than originally anticipated, chiefly due to unfavorable geologic
      conditions. Operating income in 2004 included a $13 million release of legal
      liability accruals in excess of the Anglo-Dutch settlement, offset by $33
      million in losses on the fixed-price integrated solutions projects in Mexico
      and
      an $11 million charge for an intellectual property settlement.

Government
      and Infrastructure

revenue
      for 2005 totaled $8.1 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease compared to 2004.
      Iraq-related activities in the Middle East decreased $1.6 billion primarily
      due
      to completion of our RIO contract. Partially offsetting the decrease was $362
      million higher revenue earned by the DML shipyard and hurricane repair efforts
      to United States naval facilities on the Gulf Coast under the CONCAP
      contract.


Operating
      income for 2005 was $330 million compared to $84 million in 2004, a $246 million
      increase. Iraq-related income increased $97 million compared to 2004, primarily
      due to income from the award fees on definitized LogCAP task orders, settlement
      of DFAC issues, and resolution of disputed fuel costs and other issues.
      Increased activities from our DML shipyard positively impacted 2005 operating
      income by $13 million. In addition, hurricane repair efforts to United States
      naval facilities on the Gulf Coast under the CONCAP contract contributed to
      the
      increase. The 2005 results also included a combined $96 million in operating
      income from the sale of and one-time cash distribution from an interest in
      a
      United States toll road. The operating income comparison was adversely impacted
      by completion of the RIO contract in 2004. Segment results in 2004 included
      restructuring charges of $12 million.

Energy
      and Chemicals

revenue
      for 2005 decreased $329 million compared to 2004. Revenue from offshore EPIC
      projects decreased $205 million as these projects were substantially completed
      during 2005. Additionally, revenue from several older LNG and oil and gas
      projects in Africa and Australia and an olefins project in the United States
      collectively decreased $424 million as these projects were also completed or
      substantially completed in 2005. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher
      activity on an offshore engineering and management project in the Caspian and
      a
      crude oil facility project in Canada, totaling $76 million. Additional increases
      resulted from revenue earned on projects awarded in 2005 located in Australia,
      Indonesia, and Nigeria, totaling $220 million.

Operating
      income totaled $168 million in 2005 compared to a $426 million loss in 2004,
      a
      $594 million increase. Contributing to improved operating income in 2005 were
      stronger results on many projects, including joint venture gas projects in
      Nigeria, offshore engineering and project management projects in Angola and
      the
      Caspian, and recently awarded LNG and GTL projects, collectively totaling $44
      million. Additionally, 2005 results benefited from $21 million of gains on
      sales
      of assets and investments. Conversely, included in 2005 operating income were
      $30 million of losses on an Algerian gas processing plant project and $50
      million of charges related to an unconsolidated Algerian joint venture. Included
      in the 2004 results were a $407 million loss on the Barracuda-Caratinga project
      in Brazil, $47 million of losses on the same gas processing plant project in
      Algeria, $29 million of losses on the Belanak project in Indonesia, and
      restructuring charges of $28 million.

General
      corporate

expenses
      were $115 million in 2005 compared to $87 million in 2004. The increase was
      primarily due to increases to a self-insurance reserve, higher legal and other
      professional expenses on specific projects, and increased corporate
      communication costs.

NONOPERATING
      ITEMS

Interest
      expense

decreased $22 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the
      amortization in 2004 of issue costs related to a master letter of credit
      facility that expired in the fourth quarter of 2004, the redemption in April
      2005 of $500 million of our floating rate senior notes, and interest on tax
      deficiencies in Indonesia in 2004.

Interest
      income

increased $20 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher cash investment
      balances.

Foreign
      currency losses, net

grew to
      $13 million in 2005 from $3 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due
      to
      losses on the British pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by gains
      on
      the Brazilian real.

Other,
      net

decreased $16 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2005 year included higher
      costs related to our ESG accounts receivable securitization facility and sales
      of our United States government accounts receivable. “Other, net” in 2004
      included a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of our remaining shares of
      National Oilwell, Inc. common stock received in the January 2003 disposition
      of
      Mono Pumps.

Provision
      for income taxes

from
      continuing operations in 2005 of $79 million resulted in an effective tax rate
      of 3% compared to an effective tax rate of 37% in 2004. Our 2005 tax rate is
      lower because we recorded favorable adjustments to our valuation allowance
      against our deferred tax asset related to asbestos and silica liabilities in
      2005 totaling $805 million. Our strong 2005 earnings, coupled with an upward
      revision in our estimate of future domestic taxable income in 2006 and beyond,
      drove these adjustments. In 2006 and beyond, we expect our effective tax rate
      to
      return to the range of 35% to 37%.


Minority
      interest in net income of subsidiaries

increased $31 million compared to 2004 primarily due to earnings growth from
      the
      DML shipyard, our GTL joint venture project in Nigeria, and our WellDynamics
      joint venture.

Income
      (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax

in 2004
      included a $778 million pretax charge for the revaluation of the 59.5 million
      shares of Halliburton common stock contributed to the asbestos claimant trust,
      a
      $698 million pretax charge related to the write-down of the asbestos and silica
      insurance receivable, a $44 million accrual related to a partitioning agreement,
      and an $11 million pretax charge related to a delayed-draw term facility that
      expired in June 2004. The remaining amount primarily consisted of professional
      and administrative fees related to various aspects of the asbestos and silica
      settlement.

The
      increase in consolidated revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was largely
      attributable to activity in our government services projects, primarily in
      the
      Middle East, and to increased sales of our Energy Services Group services and
      products as a result of the overall increase in worldwide rig counts.
      International revenue was 78% of consolidated revenue in 2004 and 73% of
      consolidated revenue in 2003, with the increase attributable to our government
      services projects abroad. Revenue from the United States Government for all
      geographic areas was approximately $8.0 billion or 39% of consolidated revenue
      in 2004 compared to $4.2 billion or 26% of consolidated revenue in
      2003.

The
      increase in consolidated operating income was primarily due to stronger
      performance in our Energy Services Group resulting from favorable changes in
      oil
      and gas prices, which increased worldwide rig counts, and pricing improvements
      in the United States in 2004.

In
      2004,
      Iraq-related work contributed approximately $7.1 billion to consolidated revenue
      and $78 million to consolidated operating income, a 1.1% margin before corporate
      costs and taxes.

Following
      is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable segment.

Production
      Optimization

increase
      in revenue compared to 2003 was largely attributable to production enhancement
      services, which yielded $430 million in higher revenue. This was driven by
      a
      higher average land gas rig count and price increases in the United States,
      increased activity in Canada and Russia, and increases in pipeline process
      services and hydraulic workover activity in the United Kingdom. Completion
      tools
      and services activities contributed $59 million to the segment revenue increase
      on improved activity in the Middle East/Asia and Europe/Africa/CIS regions.
      WellDynamics contributed $49 million to segment revenue, driven by the
      consolidation of the joint venture during the first quarter of 2004 and
      increased demand for intelligent well completions services in the Middle East
      and North America. Prior to 2004, WellDynamics was accounted for under the
      equity method in the Digital and Consulting Solutions segment. The segment’s
      improved revenue was partially offset by a significant reduction in sand control
      and completions activity in Nigeria and a $32 million decline compared to 2003
      in revenue from our surface well testing operations sold in the third quarter
      of
      2004. International revenue was 54% of total segment revenue in 2004 compared
      to
      56% in 2003.

The
      increase in Production Optimization operating income for 2004 compared to 2003
      was primarily driven by the higher production enhancement revenue described
      above, which contributed $155 million. Completion tools and services activities
      increase of $17 million primarily reflects higher sales of completions and
      sand
      control services in the United Kingdom and Norway and a more favorable product
      mix in Eurasia and Saudi Arabia, offset by a significant reduction in sand
      control tool sales in Nigeria in 2004. Included in the results were gains of
      $24
      million from the sale of Halliburton Measurement Systems in the second quarter
      of 2003 and $54 million from the sale of our surface well testing operations
      in
      the third and fourth quarters of 2004. Segment results in 2004 also included
      a
      $2 million equity income contribution compared to a $9 million equity loss
      in
      2003 from our Subsea 7, Inc. joint venture, largely attributable to changes
      in estimated project costs and claims recoveries.

Fluid
      Systems

revenue
      increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by a $177 million improvement
      in
      revenue from cementing activities, due primarily to increased land rig count
      and
      pricing improvements in the United States and start-up activity on recent
      contract awards in Mexico and Norway. Baroid Fluid Services contributed $95
      million to the segment revenue increase, resulting largely from new land work
      in
      Mexico and land rig growth in the United States and Canada. These increases
      in
      segment revenue were partially offset by significantly decreased activity in
      the
      Gulf of Mexico. International revenue was 58% of total segment revenue in 2004
      compared to 56% in 2003.

The
      Fluid
      Systems segment operating income increase compared to 2003 resulted from a
      cementing services increase of $68 million and Baroid Fluid Services increase
      of
      $22 million. These improved results occurred primarily in the United States
      due
      to increased land rig activity, improved pricing, and better utilization and
      cost management. Partially offsetting improved segment operating income in
      was a $17 million impact of reduced higher margin activity in the Gulf of
      Mexico. Included in 2003 results were equity losses of $7 million from the
      Enventure expandable casing joint venture, which did not reoccur in 2004. This
      joint venture is currently accounted for on a cost basis since reducing our
      ownership in the first quarter of 2004.


Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

revenue
      improvement in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by a $66 million increase in
      logging and perforating services due to higher land rig activity and pricing
      improvements in the United States and equipment sales to China. Drilling
      services contributed $40 million to the segment revenue increase, resulting
      principally from new contracts in Norway and Brazil and higher activity in
      Canada, Venezuela, and Argentina. The increase in drilling services revenue
      was
      partially offset by a substantial decline in logging-while-drilling activity
      in
      the Gulf of Mexico. Drill bits sales increased $29 million, benefiting from
      increases in land rig activity, improved pricing, and better market penetration
      with fixed cutter and roller cone bits primarily in the United States, as well
      as sales growth in the Caspian Sea region and China. International revenue
      was
      72% of total segment revenue in 2004 and in 2003.

The
      increase in Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment operating income was
      due
      to improved results in drilling services, which benefited from a lower
      depreciation expense of $35 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due
      to
      extending depreciable asset lives in the second quarter of 2004. Logging and
      perforating services contributed $33 million to the increase, due to improved
      pricing and land rig activity in the United States and equipment sales in China.
      Drill bits contributed $12 million to improved segment results on higher revenue
      in the United States and the Caspian Sea region. Operating income for 2003
      included a $36 million gain on the disposition of Mono Pumps in the first
      quarter of 2003.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

revenue
      increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to a $27 million increase
      in
      Landmark. During 2004, Landmark achieved its highest revenue since we acquired
      it. Software-related sales in Landmark increased in 2004 due to strong
      acceptance of the new real-time (drilling) and GeoProbe® offerings. The increase
      in segment revenue was partially offset by a decline in subsea operations in
      the
      first half of 2004 and the absence of $11 million of revenue from Wellstream
      prior to the sale of this business in the first quarter of 2003. International
      revenue was 69% of total segment revenue in 2004 compared to 67% in
      2003.

Segment
      operating income increased $75 million from a loss position in 2003. This
      segment recorded a $77 million charge related to the Anglo-Dutch lawsuit in
      the
      third quarter of 2003 and a $15 million loss on the disposition of Wellstream
      in
      the first quarter of 2003. For 2004, results were positively impacted by a
      $13
      million release of legal liability accruals in the first quarter of 2004
      pertaining to the April 2004 Anglo-Dutch settlement and increased integrated
      solutions operating income stemming from higher commodity prices. The increase
      in the segment was partially offset by a $33 million loss recorded in the fourth
      quarter of 2004 on two integrated solutions projects in Mexico. The loss
      resulted from operational start-up and subsurface problems on the initial wells,
      third-party and other cost increases, increased drilling times, and a work
      stoppage due to community blockage. The charge reflects the estimated total
      project loss through completion of the drilling program in mid-2006. Segment
      results for 2004 also included an $11 million charge for an intellectual
      property settlement.

Government
      and Infrastructure

revenue
      increased $4.0 billion compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to
      $3.7
      billion higher revenue from government services contracts in the Middle East.
      Activities in the DML shipyard projects also contributed $108 million to
      increased revenue in 2004 compared to 2003.

The
      Government and Infrastructure operating income decrease resulted from $94
      million in write-downs on infrastructure projects in Europe and Africa, a
      government project in Afghanistan, completion of the construction phase of
      a
      rail project in Australia, and reduction in activities in the government project
      in the Balkans. The 2004 results were also impacted by a restructuring charge
      of
      $12 million due to the reorganization of KBR. The charge related to personnel
      termination benefits. Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in
      income of $14 million from Iraq-related activities primarily due to the LogCAP
      contract.

Energy
      and Chemicals

decrease
      in revenue compared to 2003 was primarily due to lower revenue of $1.1 billion
      on the Barracuda-Caratinga project in Brazil, the Belanak project in Indonesia,
      completion of refining facilities in the United States, gas projects in Africa,
      offshore projects in Mexico, and a hydrocarbon project in Europe. The decrease
      was partially offset by higher revenue of $391 million on refining projects
      in
      Canada, an olefins project in the United States, operations and maintenance
      projects in the United States and the United Kingdom, and new offshore program
      management projects.


The
      operating loss for the segment in 2004 primarily resulted from $407 million
      of
      losses on the Barracuda-Caratinga project in Brazil, $47 million of losses
      on a
      gas project in Africa, and $29 million of losses on the Belanak project in
      Indonesia. The losses recognized on the Barracuda-Caratinga project were
      primarily due to the agreement with Petrobras, higher cost estimates, schedule
      delays, and increased contingencies for the balance of the project until
      completion. Specifically, in the second quarter, with the integration phase
      of
      the Barracuda vessel we experienced a significant reduction in productivity
      and
      rework required from the vessel conversion. Also included in the 2004 results
      was a restructuring charge of $28 million due to the reorganization of KBR.
      The
      charge related to personnel termination benefits and asset impairments.
      Operating losses in 2004 were partially offset by a $59 million increase on
      an
      LNG project in Egypt, a refining project in Canada, operations and maintenance
      projects in the United States and United Kingdom, and new offshore program
      management projects. The operating loss for 2003 included losses recognized
      on
      the Barracuda-Caratinga project of $238 million and losses on a hydrocarbon
      project in Belgium.

General
      corporate

expenses
      for 2004 increased primarily due to a $7.5 million charge related to a
      settlement with the SEC, financing fees on outstanding credit facilities,
      Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses, and increased legal fees.

NONOPERATING
      ITEMS

Interest
      expense

increased $90 million in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to interest on
      $1.2 billion convertible notes issued in June 2003, $1.05 billion senior
      floating and fixed notes issued in October 2003, $500 million senior
      floating-rate notes issued in January 2004, and interest on tax deficiencies
      in
      Indonesia and Mexico.

Interest
      income

increased $14 million in 2004 compared to the same period in 2003, attributable
      to higher average daily cash balances during the year and interest on tax
      refunds in various jurisdictions.

Loss
      from discontinued operations, net of tax

in 2004
      included, on a pretax basis, a $778 million charge for the revaluation of 59.5
      million shares of Halliburton common stock to be contributed to the asbestos
      claimant trust as part of the proposed settlement, a $698 million charge related
      to the write-down of the asbestos and silica insurance receivable, a $44 million
      charge related to our October 2004 partitioning agreement, and an $11 million
      charge related to the delayed-draw term facility, which expired in June 2004.
      The remaining amount primarily consisted of professional and administrative
      fees
      related to various aspects of the proposed asbestos and silica settlement,
      accretion on the asbestos insurance receivables, and our October 2004
      partitioning agreement. The loss from discontinued operations was $1.145 billion
      in 2003. The benefit for income taxes on discontinued operations was $180
      million in 2004, compared to a provision of $6 million for 2003. We have
      established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from
      the asbestos and silica charges to reflect the expected net tax benefit from
      the
      future deductions the charges will create. In 2004, we increased the valuation
      allowance by $449 million to a balance of $1.073 billion. The balance at the
      end
      of 2003 was $624 million.

Cumulative
      effect of change in accounting principle, net

for the
      year ended 2003 was an $8 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per diluted share,
      related to our January 1, 2003 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS
      No. 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations
      associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
      assets’ retirement costs. The asset retirement obligations primarily relate to
      the removal of leasehold improvements upon exiting certain lease arrangements
      and restoration of land associated with the mining of bentonite.

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
      preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates.
      Our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better
      understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future
      events and related estimations and how they can impact our financial statements.
      A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult,
      subjective, or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our
      results of operations. We identified our most critical accounting policies
      and
      estimates to be:


-

percentage-of-completion
                accounting for contracts to provide construction, engineering, design,
                or
                similar services;

-

accounting
                for government contracts;

-

allowance
                for bad debts;

-

forecasting
                our effective tax rate, including our future ability to utilize foreign
                tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax
                assets;

-

legal
                and investigation matters; and

-

pensions.

We
      base
      our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we
      believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances,
      the
      results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
      of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
      We
      believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the
      preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant
      estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This
      discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
      financial statements and related notes included in this report.

We
      have
      discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies
      and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit
      Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below.

Percentage
      of completion

Revenue
      from contracts to provide construction, engineering, design or similar services,
      almost all of which relates to KBR, is reported on the percentage-of-completion
      method of accounting. This method of accounting requires us to calculate job
      profit to be recognized in each reporting period for each job based upon our
      projections of future outcomes, which include:

-

estimates
                of the total cost to complete the
                project;

-

estimates
                of project schedule and completion
                date;

-

estimates
                of the percentage the project is complete;
                and

-

amounts
                of any probable unapproved claims and change orders included in
                revenue.

At
      the
      outset of each contract, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost
      to
      complete the project. Risks relating to service delivery, usage, productivity,
      and other factors are considered in the estimation process. Our project
      personnel periodically evaluate the estimated costs, claims, change orders,
      and
      percentage of completion at the project level. The recording of profits and
      losses on long-term contracts requires an estimate of the total profit or loss
      over the life of each contract. This estimate requires consideration of contract
      revenue, change orders, and claims, less costs incurred and estimated costs
      to
      complete. Anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the period
      in
      which they become evident. Profits are recorded based upon the total estimated
      contract profit times the current percentage complete for the
      contract.

When
      calculating the amount of total profit or loss on a long-term contract, we
      include unapproved claims as revenue when the collection is deemed probable
      based upon the four criteria for recognizing unapproved claims under the
      American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1,
      “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
      Contracts.” Including probable unapproved claims in this calculation increases
      the operating income (or reduces the operating loss) that would otherwise be
      recorded without consideration of the probable unapproved claims. Probable
      unapproved claims are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and include
      no
      profit element. In all cases, the probable unapproved claims included in
      determining contract profit or loss are less than the actual claim that will
      be
      or has been presented to the customer. We are actively engaged in claims
      negotiations with our customers, and the success of claims negotiations has
      a
      direct impact on the profit or loss recorded for any related long-term contract.
      Unsuccessful claims negotiations could result in decreases in estimated contract
      profits or additional contract losses, and successful claims negotiations could
      result in increases in estimated contract profits or recovery of previously
      recorded contract losses.


At
      least
      quarterly, significant projects are reviewed in detail by senior management.
      We
      have a long history of dealing with multiple types of projects and in preparing
      cost estimates. However, there are many factors that impact future costs,
      including but not limited to weather, inflation, labor and community
      disruptions, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors
      as outlined in our “Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors.” These factors
      can affect the accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future
      reported earnings. In the past, we have incurred substantial losses on projects
      that were not initially projected, including our Barracuda-Caratinga project
      (see “Barracuda-Caratinga project” in Note 2 of our consolidated financial
      statements for further discussion).

Accounting
      for government contracts

Most
      of
      the services provided to the United States government are governed by
      cost-reimbursable contracts. Services under our LogCAP, PCO Oil South, and
      Balkans support contracts are examples of these types of arrangements.
      Generally, these contracts contain both a base fee (a fixed profit percentage
      applied to our actual costs to complete the work) and an award fee (a variable
      profit percentage applied to definitized costs, which is subject to our
      customer’s discretion and tied to the specific performance measures defined in
      the contract, such as adherence to schedule, health and safety, quality of
      work,
      responsiveness, cost performance, and business management).

Base
      fee
      revenue is recorded at the time services are performed, based upon actual
      project costs incurred, and includes a reimbursement fee for general,
      administrative, and overhead costs. The general, administrative, and overhead
      cost reimbursement fees are estimated periodically in accordance with government
      contract accounting regulations and may change based on actual costs incurred
      or
      based upon the volume of work performed. Revenue is reduced for our estimate
      of
      costs that may be categorized as disputed or unallowable as a result of cost
      overruns or the audit process.

Award
      fees are generally evaluated and granted periodically by our customer. For
      contracts entered into prior to June 30, 2003, award fees are recognized during
      the term of the contract based on our estimate of amounts to be awarded. Once
      award fees are granted and task orders underlying the work are definitized,
      we
      adjust our estimate of award fees to actual amounts earned. Our estimates are
      often based on our past award experience for similar types of work. We have
      been
      receiving award fees on the Balkans project since 1995, and our estimates for
      award fees for this project have generally been accurate in the periods
      presented. During 2005, we began to receive LogCAP award fee scores, and, based
      on these actual amounts, we adjusted our accrual rate for future awards. The
      controversial nature of this contract may cause actual awards to vary
      significantly from past experience.

For
      contracts containing multiple deliverables entered into subsequent to June
      30,
      2003 (such as PCO Oil South), we analyze each activity within the contract
      to
      ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of Emerging Issues Task
      Force
      Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and the
      revenue recognition guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue
      Recognition.” For service-only contracts and service elements of multiple
      deliverable arrangements, award fees are recognized only when definitized and
      awarded by the customer. Award fees on government construction contracts are
      recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount
      of fees to be awarded.

Similar
      to many cost-reimbursable contracts, these government contracts are typically
      subject to audit and adjustment by our customer. Each contract is unique;
      therefore, the level of confidence in our estimates for audit adjustments varies
      depending on how much historical data we have with a particular contract.
      Further, the significant size and controversial nature of our contracts may
      cause actual awards to vary significantly from past experience.

The
      estimates employed in our accounting for government contracts affect our
      Government and Infrastructure segment.


Allowance
      for bad debts

We
      evaluate our accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing
      our
      portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. This process consists
      of
      a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status
      of
      the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the
      receivables involve retentions. We also consider the economic environment of
      our
      customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating
      the
      need for an allowance. Based on our review of these factors, we establish or
      adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio
      as a whole. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation,
      and
      frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, our results of
      operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual
      write-offs that differ from estimated amounts. Our estimates of allowances
      for
      bad debts have historically been accurate. Over the last five years, our
      estimates of allowances for bad debts, as a percentage of notes and accounts
      receivable before the allowance, have ranged from 2.8% to 6.0%. At December
      31,
      2005, allowance for bad debts totaled $90 million or 2.8% of notes and accounts
      receivable before the allowance, and at December 31, 2004, allowance for bad
      debts totaled $127 million or 4.2% of notes and accounts receivable before
      the
      allowance. The 29% decrease in allowance for bad debts is primarily due to
      improved collection processes as the percentage of receivables outstanding
      over
      90 days decreased from 19%, as of December 31, 2004, to 10% as of December
      31,
      2005. A 1% change in our estimate of the collectibility of our notes and
      accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2005 would have resulted in
      a $32
      million adjustment to 2005 total operating costs and expenses.

Income
      tax accounting

We
      account for our income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
      Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or
      refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in
      recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future
      tax
      consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
      or
      tax returns. We apply the following basic principles in accounting for our
      income taxes:

-

a
                current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes
                payable or refundable on tax returns for the current
                year;

-

a
                deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future
                tax
                effects attributable to temporary differences and
                carryforwards;

-

the
                measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is
                based on
                provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future
                changes in tax laws or rates are not considered;
                and

-

the
                value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount
                of
                any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected
                to be
                realized.

We
      determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity
      or
      a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax
      jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures:

-

identifying
                the types and amounts of existing temporary
                differences;

-

measuring
                the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences
                using
                the applicable tax rate;

-

measuring
                the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences
                and
                operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax
                rate;

-

measuring
                the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward;
                and

-

reducing
                the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available
                evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
                the
                deferred tax assets will not be
                realized.

Our
      methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment
      in the use of assumptions and estimates. Additionally, we use forecasts of
      certain tax elements such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization,
      as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies.
      Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there
      can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results. Unforeseen
      events may significantly impact these variables, and changes to these variables
      could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to both
      continuing and discontinued operations.


We
      have
      operations in about 100 countries other than the United States. Consequently,
      we
      are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities.
      The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases,
      including income actually earned, income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax
      withholding. The final determination of our tax liabilities involves the
      interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in
      each
      jurisdiction. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax
      law
      and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our tax
      liabilities for a tax year.

Tax
      filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates, and related entities
      are
      routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. These
      examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to
      resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. Predicting
      the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. Factors such
      as
      the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to
      negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across
      the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate
      outcome. We review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions
      and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest,
      and penalties as needed based on this outcome.

We
      have
      recorded a valuation allowance based on the anticipated impact of the asbestos
      and silica deductions on our ability to utilize future foreign tax credits
      in
      the United States. This valuation allowance is reassessed quarterly based on
      a
      number of estimates including future creditable foreign taxes and future taxable
      income. Factors such as actual operating results, material acquisitions or
      dispositions, and changes to our operating environment could alter the
      estimates, and such changes could have a material impact on the valuation
      allowance. For example, as a result of our strong 2005 earnings, coupled with
      an
      upward revision in our estimate of future domestic taxable income for 2006
      and
      beyond, we recorded favorable adjustments to this valuation allowance in 2005
      totaling $805 million.

Legal
      and investigation matters

As
      discussed in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements, as of December
      31, 2005, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for
      the resolution of some of these matters. For other matters for which the
      liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any
      amounts. Attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed
      against us and review all pending investigations. Generally, the estimate of
      probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with
      internal and outside legal counsel representing us. Our estimates are based
      upon
      an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and
      settlement strategies. The precision of these estimates is impacted by the
      amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. We attempt to resolve
      these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when
      possible. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after
      appeals, differ from our estimates, our future financial results may be
      adversely affected. We have in the past recorded significant adjustments to
      our
      initial estimates of these types of contingencies.

Pensions

Our
      pension benefit obligations and expenses are calculated using actuarial models
      and methods, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
      Pensions.” Two of the more critical assumptions and estimates used in the
      actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value
      of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Other critical
      assumptions and estimates used in determining benefit obligations and plan
      expenses, including demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality,
      and
      turnover, are also evaluated periodically and updated accordingly to reflect
      our
      actual experience.

Discount
      rates are determined annually and are based on rates of return of high-quality
      fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during
      the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Expected long-term rates of
      return on plan assets are determined annually and are based on an evaluation
      of
      our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into account current
      and expected market conditions. Plan assets are comprised primarily of equity
      and debt securities. As we have both domestic and international plans, these
      assumptions differ based on varying factors specific to each particular country
      or economic environment.


The
      discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation at the
      measurement date for our United States pension plans remained flat at 5.75%
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004. The discount rate utilized to determine the
      projected benefit obligation at the measurement date for our United Kingdom
      pension plans, which constitute 95% of our international plans and 91% of all
      plans, was reduced from 5.50% at December 31, 2004 to 5.00% at December 31,
      2005. This decrease in discount rate resulted in increases in the present value
      of our benefit obligations and plan expenses. An additional future decrease
      in
      the discount rate of 50 basis points for our United Kingdom pension plans would
      increase our projected benefit obligation by an estimated $400 million, while
      a
      similar increase in the discount rate would reduce our projected benefit
      obligation by an estimated $360 million.

Our
      defined benefit plans reduced pretax earnings by $84 million in 2005, $91
      million in 2004, and $75 million in 2003. Included in the amounts were earnings
      from our expected pension returns of $196 million in 2005, $184 million in
      2004,
      and $148 million in 2003. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being
      recognized over a period of 4 to 32 years, which represents the expected
      remaining service life of the employee group. Our unrecognized actuarial gains
      and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumptions
      changes in the obligations and the difference between expected returns and
      actual returns on plan assets. Actual returns for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were
      $553
      million, $276 million, and $160 million, respectively. The difference between
      actual and expected returns is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or
      loss and is recognized as future pension expense. Our unrecognized actuarial
      loss at December 31, 2005 was $678 million, of which $31 million will be
      recognized as a component of our expected 2006 pension expense. During 2005,
      we
      made contributions to fund our defined benefit plans of $81 million. We expect
      to make additional contributions in 2006 of approximately $164
      million.

The
      actuarial assumptions used in determining our pension benefits may differ
      materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,
      higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of
      participants. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate,
      differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect
      our financial position or results of operations.

OFF
      BALANCE SHEET RISK

Under
      an
      agreement to sell United States Energy Services Group accounts receivable to
      a
      bankruptcy-remote limited-purpose funding subsidiary, new receivables were
      added
      on a continuous basis to the pool of receivables. Collections reduced previously
      sold accounts receivable. This funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership
      interest in this pool of receivables to entities managed by unaffiliated
      financial institutions under another agreement. Sales to the funding subsidiary
      were structured as “true sales” under applicable bankruptcy laws. While the
      funding subsidiary was wholly owned by us, its assets were not available to
      pay
      any creditors of ours or of our subsidiaries or affiliates. The undivided
      ownership interest in the pool of receivables sold to the unaffiliated
      companies, therefore, was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in
      our
      consolidated balance sheets. The funding subsidiary retained the interest in
      the
      pool of receivables that were not sold to the unaffiliated companies and was
      fully consolidated and reported in our financial statements.

The
      amount of undivided interests which could be sold under the program varied
      based
      on the amount of eligible Energy Services Group receivables in the pool at
      any
      given time and other factors. The maximum amount that could be sold and
      outstanding under this agreement at any given time was $300 million. As of
      December 31, 2004, we had sold $256 million of undivided ownership interest
      to
      unaffiliated companies. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these receivables
      were collected and the balance retired. No further receivables were sold, and
      the facility was terminated subsequent to December 31, 2005.

In
      May
      2004, we entered into an agreement to sell, assign, and transfer the entire
      title and interest in specified United States government accounts receivable
      of
      KBR to a third party. The face value of the receivables sold to the third party
      was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance
      sheets. The amount of receivables that could be sold under the agreement varied
      based on the amount of eligible receivables at any given time and other factors,
      and the maximum amount that could be sold and outstanding under this agreement
      at any given time was $650 million. The total amount of receivables outstanding
      under this agreement as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $263 million.
      As
      of December 31, 2005, these receivables were collected, the balance was retired,
      and the facility was terminated.


We
      have
      exposure to losses in certain unconsolidated variable interest entities. See
      Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more
      information.

FINANCIAL
      INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

We
      are
      exposed to financial instrument market risk from changes in foreign currency
      exchange rates, interest rates, and, to a limited extent, commodity prices.
      We
      selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments
      to
      mitigate our market risk from these exposures. The objective of our risk
      management program is to protect our cash flows related to sales or purchases
      of
      goods or services from market fluctuations in currency rates. We do not use
      derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments
      includes the following types of market risk:

-

volatility
                of the currency rates;

-

time
                horizon of the derivative
                instruments;

-

market
                cycles; and

-

the
                type of derivative instruments
                used.

We
      do not
      consider any of these risk management activities to be material. See Note 1
      to
      the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our
      accounting policies on derivative instruments. See Note 17 to the consolidated
      financial statements for additional disclosures related to derivative
      instruments.

ENVIRONMENTAL
      MATTERS

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.


In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations. Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were $50 million
      as of December 31, 2005 and $41 million as of December 31, 2004. The liability
      covers numerous properties and no individual property accounts for more than
      $10
      million of the liability balance. We have subsidiaries that have been named
      as
      potentially responsible parties along with other third parties for 14 federal
      and state superfund sites for which we have established a liability. As of
      December 31, 2005, those 14 sites accounted for approximately $13 million of
      our
      total $50 million liability. In some instances, we have been named a potentially
      responsible party by a regulatory agency, but in each of those cases, we do
      not
      believe we have any material liability.

NEW
      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
      March
      2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
      No. 47 (FIN 47), “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
      interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” This statement clarifies that an
      entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional
      asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be
      reasonably estimated. The provisions of FIN 47 were adopted as of December
      31,
      2005. The total liability recorded at adoption for asset retirement obligations
      and the related accretion and depreciation expense for all periods presented
      is
      immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
      We
      own properties where we have below ground storage tanks, test wells, and other
      items that are required to be removed before we vacate the properties. A
      liability has not been recorded for these items because the fair value cannot
      be
      reasonably estimated. We believe there is an indeterminate settlement date
      for
      these obligations because the range of time over which we may settle the
      obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No.
      123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25. In April 2005,
      the
      SEC adopted a rule that defers the required effective date of SFAS No. 123R.
      The
      SEC rule provides that SFAS No. 123R is now effective for registrants as of
      the
      beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted
      the
      provisions of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective
      application. Accordingly, we will recognize compensation expense for all newly
      granted awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after January
      1,
      2006. Compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were
      outstanding as of January 1, 2006 will be recognized ratably over the remaining
      vesting period based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated under
      the
      Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense related to the
      unvested portion of these awards will be consistent with compensation
      expense included in our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123. We will
      recognize compensation expense using the Black-Scholes pricing model for our
      Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) beginning with the January 1, 2006 purchase
      period.

We
      estimate that the effect on earnings per share in the periods following adoption
      of SFAS No. 123R will be a reduction of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 in net
      income per diluted share per quarter. This effect is consistent with our pro
      forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 except that estimated forfeitures will
      be
      considered in the calculation of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R.
      Additionally, the actual effect on net income and earnings per share will vary
      depending upon the number of options granted in subsequent periods compared
      to
      prior years and the number of shares purchased under the ESPP.


FORWARD-LOOKING
      INFORMATION AND RISK FACTORS

The
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions
      for forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is based on
      projections and estimates, not historical information. Some statements in this
      Form 10-K are forward-looking and use words like “may,” “may not,” “believes,”
“do not believe,” “expects,” “do not expect,” “anticipates,” “do not
      anticipate,” and other expressions. We may also provide oral or written
      forward-looking information in other materials we release to the public.
      Forward-looking information involves risk and uncertainties and reflects our
      best judgment based on current information. Our results of operations can be
      affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by known or unknown risks and
      uncertainties. In addition, other factors may affect the accuracy of our
      forward-looking information. As a result, no forward-looking information can
      be
      guaranteed. Actual events and the results of operations may vary
      materially.

We
      do not
      assume any responsibility to publicly update any of our forward-looking
      statements regardless of whether factors change as a result of new information,
      future events, or for any other reason. You should review any additional
      disclosures we make in our press releases and Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed
      with or furnished to the SEC. We also suggest that you listen to our quarterly
      earnings release conference calls with financial analysts.

While
      it
      is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking
      statements and potentially materially and adversely affect our financial
      condition and results of operations, including the risks related
      to:

United
      States Government Contract Work

We
      provide substantial work under our government contracts to the United States
      Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. These contracts include
      our worldwide United States Army logistics contracts, known as LogCAP, and
      contracts to rebuild Iraq’s petroleum industry such as PCO Oil South. Our
      government services revenue related to Iraq totaled approximately $5.4 billion
      in 2005, $7.1 billion in 2004, and $3.6 billion in 2003. Most of the services
      provided to the United States government are subject to cost-reimbursable
      contracts where we have the opportunity to earn an award fee based on our
      customer’s evaluation of the quality of our performance. These award fees are
      evaluated and granted by our customer periodically. For the LogCAP and RIO
      contracts, we recognize award fees based on our estimate of amounts to be
      awarded. In determining our estimates, we consider, among other things, past
      award experience for similar types of work. These estimates are adjusted to
      actual when the task orders are definitized and the award fees have been
      finalized by our customer.

Given
        the demands of working in Iraq and elsewhere for the United States government,
        we expect that from time to time we will have disagreements or experience
        performance issues with the various government customers for which we work.
        If
        performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government
        retains the right to pursue remedies which could include threatened termination
        or termination, under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated,
        we may not receive award fees under the affected contract, and our ability
        to
        secure future contracts could be adversely affected, although we would receive
        payment for amounts owed for our allowable costs under cost-reimbursable
        contracts. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers
        for
        any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as
        forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or
        debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative
        publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions
        as
        a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry,
        reduce our ability to compete for new contracts, and may also have a material
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
        and
        cash flow.

DCAA
      audit issues

Our
        operations under United States government contracts are regularly reviewed
        and
        audited by the DCAA and other governmental agencies. The DCAA serves in an
        advisory role to our customer. When issues are found during the governmental
        agency audit process, these issues are typically discussed and reviewed with
        us.
        The DCAA then issues an audit report with its recommendations to our customer’s
        contracting officer. In the case of management systems and other contract
        administrative issues, the contracting officer is generally with the DCMA.
        We
        then work with our customer to resolve the issues noted in the audit report.
        If
        our customer or a government auditor finds that we improperly charged any
        costs
        to a contract, these costs are not reimbursable, or, if already reimbursed,
        the
        costs must be refunded to the customer.


Laundry.

Prior to
      the fourth quarter of 2005, we received notice from the DCAA that it recommended
      withholding $18 million of subcontract costs related to the laundry service
      for
      one task order in southern Iraq for which it believes we and our subcontractors
      have not provided adequate levels of documentation supporting the quantity
      of
      the services provided. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the DCAA issued a notice
      to disallow costs totaling approximately $12 million, releasing $6 million
      of
      amounts previously withheld. The $12 million has been withheld from the
      subcontractor. We are working with the DCMA and the subcontractor to resolve
      this issue.

Containers.

In
      June
      2005, the DCAA recommended withholding certain costs associated with providing
      containerized housing for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel in Iraq.
      Approximately $55 million has been withheld as of December 31, 2005 (down from
      $60 million originally reported because some issues have been resolved). The
      DCAA recommended that the costs be withheld pending receipt of additional
      explanation or documentation to support the subcontract costs. We have provided
      information we believe addresses the concerns raised by the DCAA. None of these
      amounts have been withheld from our subcontractors. We are working with the
      government and our subcontractors to resolve this issue.

Other
      issues.

The DCAA
      is continuously performing audits of costs incurred for the foregoing and other
      services provided by us under our government contracts. During these audits,
      there are likely to be questions raised by the DCAA about the reasonableness
      or
      allowability of certain costs or the quality or quantity of supporting
      documentation. No assurance can be given that the DCAA might not recommend
      withholding some portion of the questioned costs while the issues are being
      resolved with our customer. Because of the intense scrutiny involving our
      government contracts operations, issues raised by the DCAA may be more difficult
      to resolve. We do not believe any potential withholding will have a significant
      or sustained impact on our liquidity.

Investigations

In
      October 2004, we reported to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s
      office that two former employees in Kuwait may have had inappropriate contacts
      with individuals employed by or affiliated with two third-party subcontractors
      prior to the award of the subcontracts. The Inspector General’s office may
      investigate whether these two employees may have solicited and/or accepted
      payments from these third-party subcontractors while they were employed by
      us.

In
      October 2004, a civilian contracting official in the COE asked for a review
      of
      the process used by the COE for awarding some of the contracts to us. We
      understand that the Department of Defense Inspector General’s office may review
      the issues involved.

We
      understand that the DOJ, an Assistant United States Attorney based in Illinois,
      and others are investigating these and other individually immaterial matters
      we
      have reported relating to our government contract work in Iraq. If criminal
      wrongdoing were found, criminal penalties could range up to the greater of
      $500,000 in fines per count for a corporation or twice the gross pecuniary
      gain
      or loss. We also understand that current and former employees of KBR have
      received subpoenas and have given or may give grand jury testimony related
      to
      some of these matters.

Withholding
      of payments

The
      PCO
      Oil South project has definitized substantially all of the task orders, and
      we
      have collected a significant portion of the amounts previously withheld. We
      do
      not believe the withholding will have a significant or sustained impact on
      our
      liquidity because the withholding is temporary, and the definitization process
      is substantially complete.

We
      are
      working diligently with our customers to proceed with significant new work
      only
      after we have a fully definitized task order, which should limit withholdings
      on
      future task orders for all government contracts.

In
      addition, we had probable unapproved claims totaling $69 million at December
      31,
      2005 for the LogCAP and PCO Oil South contracts. These unapproved claims related
      to contracts where our costs have exceeded the customer’s funded value of the
      task order.


DCMA
      system reviews

Report
      on estimating system.

On
      December 27, 2004, the DCMA granted continued approval of our estimating system,
      stating that our estimating system is “acceptable with corrective action.” We
      are in the process of completing these corrective actions. Specifically, based
      on the unprecedented level of support that our employees are providing the
      military in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we needed to update our estimating
      policies and procedures to make them better suited to such contingency
      situations. Additionally, we have completed our development of a detailed
      training program and have made it available to all estimating personnel to
      ensure that employees are adequately prepared to deal with the challenges and
      unique circumstances associated with a contingency operation.

Report
      on purchasing system.

As a
      result of a Contractor Purchasing System Review by the DCMA during the fourth
      quarter of 2005, the DCMA granted the continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system. The DCMA’s approval letter, dated October 28, 2005,
      stated that our purchasing system’s policies and practices are “effective and
      efficient, and provide adequate protection of the Government’s
      interest.”

Report
      on accounting system.

We
      received two draft reports on our accounting system, which raised various issues
      and questions. We have responded to the points raised by the DCAA, but this
      review remains open. Once the DCAA finalizes the report, it will be submitted
      to
      the DCMA, who will make a determination of the adequacy of our accounting
      systems for government contracting.

The
      Balkans

We
      have
      had inquiries in the past by the DCAA and the civil fraud division of the DOJ
      into possible overcharges for work performed during 1996 through 2000 under
      a
      contract in the Balkans for which inquiry has not yet been completed by the
      DOJ.
      Based on an internal investigation, we credited our customer approximately
      $2
      million during 2000 and 2001 related to our work in the Balkans as a result
      of
      billings for which support was not readily available. We believe that the
      preliminary DOJ inquiry relates to potential overcharges in connection with
      a
      part of the Balkans contract under which approximately $100 million in work
      was
      done. We believe that any allegations of overcharges would be without merit.
      Amounts accrued related to this matter as of December 31, 2005 are not
      material.

Development
      Fund for Iraq

We
      have
      some task orders issued and executed under the PCO Oil contract that are funded
      under the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). We received notification in the
      third
      quarter of 2005 that United States government personnel have decided to cease
      all administration of DFI funded contracts after December 31, 2005. In December
      2005, we received notification that this deadline was deferred until December
      31, 2006. If not deferred again at year end 2006, that could mean that we may
      be
      required to obtain payment for all services provided under the affected task
      orders after that date and for all invoices submitted and not paid prior to
      that
      date from the sovereign Republic of Iraq. As our PCO Oil contract is with the
      United States government, it is unclear what the ramifications of such a change
      in funding, if implemented, would have or what the financial implications would
      be.

Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into payments made in connection with
      the
      construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a multibillion dollar natural
      gas liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
      Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related criminal investigation. The
      government has also issued a subpoena to Halliburton seeking information, which
      we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection with
      multiple projects or services over the past 20 years located both in and outside
      of Nigeria in which The M .W. Kellogg Company, M. W. Kellogg, Ltd., Kellogg
      Brown & Root or their joint ventures, as well as the Halliburton energy
      services business, were participants. M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. is a joint venture
      in
      which Kellogg Brown & Root has a 55% interest. The M. W. Kellogg Company was
      a subsidiary of Dresser Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser
      Industries and was later merged with a subsidiary of ours to form Kellogg Brown
      & Root.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the FCPA. We have been cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ, as well as with
      investigations into the Bonny Island project in France and Nigeria. Our Board
      of
      Directors has appointed a committee of independent directors to oversee and
      direct the FCPA investigations.


The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries (which included M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. and The M .W. Kellogg
      Company)) and include TSKJ’s use of a Japanese trading company that contracted
      to provide services to TSKJ. We have produced documents to the SEC and the
      DOJ
      both voluntarily and pursuant to subpoenas, and we are making our employees
      available to the SEC and the DOJ for interviews. In addition, we understand
      that
      the SEC has issued a subpoena to A. Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a
      consultant and chairman of KBR, and to others, including certain current and
      former KBR employees and at least one subcontractor of KBR. We further
      understand that the DOJ has invoked its authority under a sitting grand jury
      to
      issue subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we
      understand that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ
      and
      the SEC with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
      subpoenas.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (an affiliate of ENI
      SpA
      of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (as successor
      to The M. W. Kellogg Company), each of which owns 25% of the venture. TSKJ
      and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA).
      Commencing in 1995, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements in
      connection with the Bonny Island project, including with Tri-Star Investments,
      of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal. We understand that a French magistrate
      has officially placed Mr. Tesler under investigation for corruption of a foreign
      public official. In Nigeria, a legislative committee of the National Assembly
      and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is organized as part
      of
      the executive branch of the government, are also investigating these matters.
      Our representatives have met with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials.
      In October 2004, representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the
      Nigerian legislative committee.

As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe, based on the ongoing governmental and
      other investigations, that payments may have been made to Nigerian
      officials.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements.

In
      June
      2004, we terminated all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant
      and former employee of M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. The terminations occurred because
      of
      violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved the receipt
      of improper personal benefits in connection with TSKJ’s construction of the
      natural gas liquefaction facility in Nigeria.

Until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding compliance with
      applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct, we have also suspended the
      services of another agent who has worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several
      current projects and on numerous older projects going back to the early 1980’s.
      In addition, we are actively reviewing the compliance of an additional agent
      on
      a separate current Nigerian project with respect to which we have recently
      received from a joint venture partner on that project allegations of wrongful
      payments made by such agent. In February 2005, TSKJ notified the Attorney
      General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not oppose the Attorney General’s efforts to
      have sums of money held on deposit in banks in Switzerland transferred to
      Nigeria and to have the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian
      courts.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement, and injunctive relief. Criminal penalties
      could range up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss.

Both
      the
      SEC and the DOJ could argue that continuing conduct may constitute multiple
      violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts per
      violation.

Often,
      agreed dispositions for these types of matters result in a monitor being
      appointed by the SEC and/or the DOJ to review future business and practices
      with
      the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA. Fines and civil and criminal
      penalties could be mitigated, in the government’s discretion, depending on the
      level of the cooperation in the investigations.


Potential
      consequences of a criminal indictment arising out of these matters could include
      suspension by the Department of Defense or another federal, state, or local
      government agency of KBR and its affiliates from their ability to contract
      with
      United States, state or local governments, or government agencies and, if a
      criminal or civil violation were found, KBR and its affiliates could be debarred
      from future contracts or new orders under current contracts to provide services
      to any such parties. During 2005, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $6.6 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. Consistent with our cooperation
      with the DOJ and the SEC, we would seek to obtain administrative agreements
      or
      waivers to avoid suspension or debarment. Generally, debarments can last up
      to
      three years. Suspension or debarment from the government contracts business
      would have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations
      of KBR and Halliburton.

There
      can
      be no assurance that any governmental investigation or our investigation of
      these matters will not conclude that violations of applicable laws have
      occurred. The results of these investigations could have a material adverse
      effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition,
      and cash flows.

In
      addition, we understand that the actions of some
      officers and key employees within our KBR Energy and Chemicals segment are
      of
      interest to the SEC and the DOJ in the FCPA investigations.  If, as a
      result of these investigations, or as a result of our determining that their
      conduct was inconsistent with employment by a publicly-held company, one or
      more
      of these officers or employees were to take a leave of absence or resign or
      were
      temporarily or permanently relieved of their duties, such events could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we have not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments made in connection with the
      Nigerian project, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and
      other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one or
      more
      competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such coordination
      possibly began as early as the mid-1980s, which was significantly before our
      1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries.

On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Suspension or debarment from contracting
      with the United States, state or local governments, or government agencies
      could
      also occur. Criminal prosecutions under applicable laws of relevant foreign
      jurisdictions and civil claims by or relationship issues with customers are
      also
      possible.

There
      can
      be no assurance that the results of these investigations will not have a
      material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

Operations
      in Iran

We
      received and responded to an inquiry in mid-2001 from the Office of Foreign
      Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Treasury Department with respect
      to
      operations in Iran by a Halliburton subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman
      Islands. The OFAC inquiry requested information with respect to compliance
      with
      the Iranian Transaction Regulations. These regulations prohibit United States
      citizens, including United States corporations and other United States business
      organizations, from engaging in commercial, financial, or trade transactions
      with Iran, unless authorized by OFAC or exempted by statute. Our 2001 written
      response to OFAC stated that we believed that we were in compliance with
      applicable sanction regulations. In January 2004, we received a follow-up letter
      from OFAC requesting additional information. We responded to this request on
      March 19, 2004. We understand this matter has now been referred by OFAC to
      the
      DOJ. In July 2004, we received a grand jury subpoena from an Assistant United
      States District Attorney requesting the production of documents. We are
      cooperating with the government’s investigation and have responded to the
      subpoena by producing documents on September 16, 2004.


Separate
      from the OFAC inquiry, we completed a study in 2003 of our activities in Iran
      during 2002 and 2003 and concluded that these activities were in compliance
      with
      applicable sanction regulations. These sanction regulations require isolation
      of
      entities that conduct activities in Iran from contact with United States
      citizens or managers of United States companies. Notwithstanding our conclusions
      that our activities in Iran were not in violation of United States laws and
      regulations, we announced that, after fulfilling our current contractual
      obligations within Iran, we intend to cease operations within that country
      and
      to withdraw from further activities there.

Geopolitical
      and International Environment

International
      and political events

A
      significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States
      operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of
      the
      countries in which we transact business. The occurrence of any of the risks
      described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results
      of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our
      operations in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately
      73% of our consolidated revenue during 2005, 78% of our consolidated revenue
      during 2004, and 73% of consolidated revenue in 2003. Based upon the location
      of
      services provided and products sold, 24% of our consolidated revenue in 2005,
      26% during 2004, and 15% during 2003 was from Iraq, primarily related to our
      work for the United States Government. Also, 10% of our consolidated revenue
      during 2005 was from the United Kingdom. Operations in countries other than
      the
      United States are subject to various risks peculiar to each country. With
      respect to any particular country, these risks may include:

-

expropriation
                and nationalization of our assets in that
                country;

-

political
                and economic instability;

-

civil
                unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, or other armed
                conflict;

-

natural
                disasters, including those related to earthquakes and
                flooding;

-

inflation;

-

currency
                fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion
                restrictions;

-

confiscatory
                taxation or other adverse tax
                policies;

-

governmental
                activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments, or limit
                the
                movement of funds;

-

governmental
                activities that may result in the deprivation of contract rights;
                and

-

governmental
                activities that may result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses
                required for operation.

Due
      to
      the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries and countries
      in which we provide governmental logistical support, our revenue and profits
      are
      subject to the adverse consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil
      unrest, strikes, currency controls, and governmental actions. Countries where
      we
      operate that have significant amounts of political risk include: Afghanistan,
      Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Russia, and Venezuela. In addition,
      military action or continued unrest in the Middle East could impact the supply
      and pricing for oil and gas, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere,
      and increase our costs for security worldwide.

In
      addition, investigations by governmental authorities (see “Foreign Corrupt
      Practices Act investigations” above), as well as legal, social, economic, and
      political issues in Nigeria, could materially and adversely affect our Nigerian
      business and operations. In September 2004, the Federal Republic of Nigeria
      issued a directive to one of our subsidiaries banning us from receiving new
      contracts from the Nigerian government or from companies controlled by the
      Nigerian government. We believe this directive to have been originally issued
      as
      a result of an adverse reaction in Nigeria to the theft from us of radioactive
      material that we used in wireline logging operations, which was subsequently
      recovered and returned to Nigeria. We received official notification that the
      contract ban had been lifted on September 7, 2005. Subsequently, by letters
      dated December 19, 2005, we were notified by the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory
      Authority that we had been issued licenses to use radioactive
      sources.

Our
      facilities and our employees are under threat of attack in some countries where
      we operate, including Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In addition, the risk related
      to
      loss of life of our personnel and our subcontractors in these areas
      continues.


We
      are
      also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners, and agents
      outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable
      laws.

Military
      action, other armed conflicts, or terrorist attacks

Military
      action in Iraq, military tension involving North Korea and Iran, as well as
      the
      terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks,
      threats of attacks, and unrest, have caused instability or uncertainty in the
      world’s financial and commercial markets and have significantly increased
      political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which
      we
      operate. Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various
      areas in which we operate, such as the Middle East and Indonesia, could limit
      or
      disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the
      evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of personnel
      or
      assets.

Such
      events may cause further disruption to financial and commercial markets and
      may
      generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic
      areas in which we operate. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence
      of the war and ongoing military action in Iraq, such as acts of terrorism in
      the
      United States or elsewhere, could materially and adversely affect us in ways
      we
      cannot predict at this time.

Income
      taxes

We
      have
      operations in about 100 countries other than the United States. Consequently,
      we
      are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities.
      The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases,
      including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and
      revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our tax liabilities
      involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related
      authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates
      and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved
      and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes
      in
      the operating environment, including changes in tax law and
      currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our tax
      liabilities for a tax year.

Foreign
      exchange and currency risks

A
      sizable
      portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses are
      in
      foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks,
      including:

-

foreign
                exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and
                the
                implementation of exchange controls;
                and

-

limitations
                on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country
                to fund
                the capital needs of our operations in other
                countries.

We
      conduct business in countries that have nontraded or “soft” currencies which,
      because of their restricted or limited trading markets, may be more difficult
      to
      exchange for “hard” currency. We may accumulate cash in soft currencies, and we
      may be limited in our ability to convert our profits into United States dollars
      or to repatriate the profits from those countries.

We
      selectively use hedging transactions to limit our exposure to risks from doing
      business in foreign currencies. For those currencies that are not readily
      convertible, our ability to hedge our exposure is limited because financial
      hedge instruments for those currencies are nonexistent or limited. Our ability
      to hedge is also limited because pricing of hedging instruments, where they
      exist, is often volatile and not necessarily efficient.

In
      addition, the value of the derivative instruments could be impacted
      by:

-

adverse
                movements in foreign exchange
                rates;

-

interest
                rates;

-

commodity
                prices; or

-

the
                value and time period of the derivative being different than the
                exposures
                or cash flows being hedged.

Customers
      and Business

Exploration
      and production activity

Demand
      for our services and products depends on oil and natural gas industry activity
      and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural
      gas prices.


Demand
      for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of
      exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding
      capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil
      companies. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations
      in
      response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and
      natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are beyond
      our control. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress
      the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity,
      often
      reflected as changes in rig counts. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and
      natural gas prices by oil and gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major
      expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development
      projects. Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the
      demand for our oil and natural gas well services and products, which could
      have
      a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Factors affecting
      the prices of oil and natural gas include:

-

governmental
                regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the
                exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural
                gas reserves;

-

global
                weather conditions and natural
                disasters;

-

worldwide
                political, military, and economic
                conditions;

-

the
                level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess
                production capacity within OPEC;

-

economic
                growth in China and India;

-

oil
                refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel
                efficiency and the use of natural
                gas;

-

the
                cost of producing and delivering oil and
                gas;

-

potential
                acceleration of development of alternative fuels;
                and

-

the
                level of demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural
                gas
                in the United States.

Historically,
      the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to
      be
      volatile. Spending on exploration and production activities and capital
      expenditures for refining and distribution facilities by large oil and gas
      companies have a significant impact on the activity levels of our businesses.
      In
      the current environment where oil and gas demand exceeds supply, the ability
      to
      rebalance supply with demand may be constrained by the global availability
      of
      rigs. Full utilization of rigs could lead to limited growth in revenue. In
      addition, the extent of the growth in oilfield services may be limited by the
      availability of equipment and manpower.

Governmental
      and capital spending

Our
      business is directly affected by changes in governmental spending and capital
      expenditures by our customers. Some of the changes that may materially and
      adversely affect us include:

-

a
                decrease in the magnitude of governmental spending and outsourcing
                for
                military and logistical support of the type that we provide. For
                example,
                the current level of government services being provided in the Middle
                East
                will not likely continue for an extended period of time and the current
                rate of spending has decreased substantially compared to 2005 and
                2004. We
                expect the volume of work under our LogCAP contract to continue to
                decline
                in 2006 as our customer scales back the amount of services we provide.
                The
                government can terminate, reduce the amount of work, or replace our
                LogCAP
                contract with a new competitively bid contract at anytime during
                the term
                of the contract;

-

an
                increase in the magnitude of governmental spending and outsourcing
                for
                military and logistical support, which can materially and adversely
                affect
                our liquidity needs as a result of additional or continued working
                capital
                requirements to support this work;

-

a
                decrease in capital spending by governments for infrastructure projects
                of
                the type that we undertake;

-

the
                consolidation of our customers, which
                could:

-

cause
                customers to reduce their capital spending, which would in turn reduce
                the
                demand for our services and products;
                and

-

result
                in customer personnel changes, which in turn affects the timing of
                contract negotiations and settlements of claims and claim negotiations
                with engineering and construction customers on cost variances and
                change
                orders on major projects;


-

adverse
                developments in the business and operations of our customers in the
                oil
                and gas industry, including write-downs of reserves and reductions
                in
                capital spending for exploration, development, production, processing,
                refining, and pipeline delivery networks;
                and

-

ability
                of our customers to timely pay the amounts due
                us.

Customers

Both
      our
      Energy Services Group and KBR depend on a limited number of significant
      customers. While, except for the United States Government, none of these
      customers represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period
      presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material
      adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of
      operations.

Acquisitions,
      dispositions, investments, and joint ventures

We
      continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various
      transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments,
      or joint ventures. These transactions are intended to result in the realization
      of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or income,
      or
      the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may be financed by additional
      borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also
      affect our consolidated results of operations.

These
      transactions also involve risks and we cannot ensure that:

-

any
                acquisitions would result in an increase in
                income;

-

any
                acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations
                and
                internal controls;

-

any
                disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash
                flow;

-

any
                dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not
                divert
                management resources; or

-

any
                dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not
                have a
                material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
                condition.

We
      conduct some operations through joint ventures, where control may be shared
      with
      unaffiliated third parties. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences
      in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions
      or
      in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of
      our
      joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy
      of
      our joint venture partners. These factors could potentially materially and
      adversely affect the business and operations of the joint venture and, in turn,
      our business and operations.

We
      own a
      36.7% interest in a joint venture that is the holder of a 50-year concession
      contract with the Australian government to operate and maintain a railway in
      Australia. We account for this investment on the equity method of accounting.
      Construction on the railway was completed in late 2003, and operations commenced
      in early 2004. This joint venture continues to gain new customers and believes
      that the originally planned customer base will ultimately be developed, although
      results through December 2005 have been less than planned. As a result, this
      joint venture has incurred inception-to-date losses, of which our share is
      $37
      million, which have been recorded in our financial statements as a loss and
      a
      reduction to our investment balance in this company. As of December 31, 2005,
      our investment in this joint venture and the related company that performed
      the
      construction of the railroad was $87 million. In addition, we have a remaining
      commitment to purchase an additional $9 million subordinated operating
      note.

Unless
      revenue is increased, this joint venture may violate certain loan covenants
      in
      the future. Management of this joint venture is currently undertaking a
      reforecast of the business, which they expect to complete during the first
      quarter of 2006. The results of this reforecast will be used to review the
      projected financial status of this joint venture, including the possible need
      for future financial restructurings, and will be used by us to assess any
      impairment in our investment.


Risks
      related to contracts

Our
      long-term contracts to provide services are either on a cost-reimbursable basis
      or on a fixed-price basis. Our failure to estimate accurately the resources
      and
      time required for a fixed-price project or our failure to complete our
      contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
      condition. In connection with projects covered by fixed-price contracts, we
      bear
      the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and
      productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance. In both
      our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we generally
      rely
      on third parties for many support services, and we are subject to liability
      for
      engineering or systems failures. Occasionally we contract to perform work for,
      as well as take a minority ownership interest in, a developmental entity. We
      may
      incur contractually reimbursable costs, make an equity investment prior to
      this
      entity achieving operational status or completing its full project financing.
      Should a developmental project fail to achieve full financial close, we could
      incur losses including our contractual receivables and our equity
      investment.

Risks
      under our fixed-price contracts.

Our
      significant EPC projects may encounter difficulties that may result in
      additional costs to us, reductions in revenue, claims, or disputes. These
      projects generally involve complex design and engineering, significant
      procurement of equipment and supplies, and extensive construction management.
      Many of these projects involve design and engineering production and
      construction phases that may occur over extended time periods, often in excess
      of two years. We could encounter difficulties that may be beyond our control
      in
      design, engineering, equipment and supply delivery, schedule changes, and other
      factors. These factors could impact our ability to complete the project in
      accordance with the original delivery schedule. For example, the equipment
      we
      purchase for a project or that is provided to us by the customer could not
      perform as expected, and these performance failures may result in delays in
      completion of the project or additional costs to us or the customer to complete
      the project and, in some cases, may require us to obtain alternate equipment
      at
      additional cost.

In
      addition, some of our contracts may require that our customers provide us with
      design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used
      on
      the project. In some cases, the customer may provide us with deficient design
      or
      engineering information or equipment or may provide the information or equipment
      to us later than required by the project schedule. The customer may also
      determine, after commencement of the project, to change various elements of
      the
      project. Our project contracts generally require the customer to compensate
      us
      for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer-requested change orders
      or failure of the customer to provide us with specified design or engineering
      information or equipment. Under these circumstances, we generally negotiate
      with
      the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the
      compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we are unable
      to
      obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation, or otherwise, adequate
      amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us
      due
      to customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide
      required items. A failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters
      could require us to record an adjustment to amounts of revenue and gross profit
      that were recognized in prior periods. Any such adjustments, if substantial,
      could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
      condition.

We
      may be
      required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or
      performance requirements of our contracts. In certain circumstances, we
      guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement
      of
      certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any such
      schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs, and
      the
      amount of such additional costs could exceed projected profit margins for the
      project. These additional costs include liquidated damages paid under
      contractual penalty provisions, which can be substantial and can accrue on
      a
      daily basis. In addition, our actual costs could exceed our projections.
      Performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual
      results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and
      could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our
      client base.


Risks
      under our fixed-price or cost-reimbursable contracts.

We
      generally rely on third-party subcontractors as well as third-party equipment
      manufacturers to assist us with the completion of our contracts. To the extent
      that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, our
      ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be
      impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services
      exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price work, we could
      experience losses in the performance of these contracts. Any delay by
      subcontractors to complete their portion of the project, or any failure by
      a
      subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project, and other
      factors beyond our control may result in delays in the overall progress of
      the
      project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. These delays and
      additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to compensate the
      project customer for these delays. While we may recover these additional costs
      from the responsible vendor, subcontractor, or other third party, we may not
      be
      able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances. In addition, if a
      subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment,
      or
      materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the
      deterioration of its financial condition, we may be required to purchase the
      services, equipment, or materials from another source at a higher price. This
      may reduce the profit or award fee to be realized or result in a loss on a
      project for which the services, equipment, or materials were
      needed.

Our
      projects expose us to potential professional liability, product liability,
      warranty, and other claims. We engineer, construct, and perform services in
      large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures can be
      disastrous. Any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at
      locations engineered or constructed by us or where our services are performed
      could result in significant professional liability, product liability, warranty,
      and other claims against us. The failure of any systems or facilities that
      we
      engineer or construct could result in warranty claims against us for significant
      replacement or reworking costs. In addition, once our construction is complete,
      we may face claims with respect to the performance of these
      facilities.

Barracuda-Caratinga
      project.

The
      Barracuda and Caratinga vessels are both fully operational. We reached
      agreement with Petrobras, subject to Lender's consent that enables us to achieve
      conclusion of the Lenders' Reliability Test and final acceptance of the
      FPSOs.  These acceptances eliminate any further risk of liquidated damages
      being assessed.  Pursuant to the agreed terms, FPSO Final Acceptance will
      occur during the first quarter of 2006.

In
      addition, at Petrobras’ direction, we have replaced certain bolts located on the
      subsea flow-lines that have failed through mid-November 2005, and we understand
      that additional bolts have failed thereafter, which have been replaced by
      Petrobras. These failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted
      inspections of the bolts. The original design specification for the bolts was
      issued by Petrobras, and as such, we believe the cost resulting from any
      replacement is not our responsibility. Petrobras has indicated, however, that
      they do not agree with our conclusion.  We have notified Petrobras that
      this matter is in dispute.  We believe several possible solutions may
      exist, including replacement of the bolts.  Estimates indicate that
      costs of these variouis solutions range up to $140 million.  Should
      Petrobras instruct us to replace the subsea bolts, the prime contract terms
      and
      conditions regarding change orders require that Petrobras make progress payments
      of our reasonable costs incurred. Petrobras could, however, perform any
      replacement of the bolts and seek reimbursement from KBR.  On March 9,
      2006 Petrobras notified KBR that they have submitted this matter to arbitration
      claiming $220 million plus interest for the cost of monitoring and replacing
      the
      defective stud bolts and, in addition, all of the costs and expenses of the
      arbitration including the cost of attorneys fees.  We do not understand the
      basis for the amount claimed by Petrobras.  We intend to vigorously defend
      ourselves and pursue recovery of the costs we have incurred to date through
      the
      arbitration process.   See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
      statements for more information.

Environmental
      requirements

Our
      businesses are subject to a variety of environmental laws, rules, and
      regulations in the United States and other countries, including those covering
      hazardous materials and requiring emission performance standards for facilities.
      For example, our well service operations routinely involve the handling of
      significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as
      hazardous substances. We also store, transport, and use radioactive and
      explosive materials in certain of our operations. Environmental requirements
      include, for example, those concerning:


-

the
                containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste,
                and
                other waste materials;

-

the
                importation and use of radioactive
                materials;

-

the
                use of underground storage tanks;
                and

-

the
                use of underground injection wells.

Environmental
      and other similar requirements generally are becoming increasingly strict.
      Sanctions for failure to comply with these requirements, many of which may
      be
      applied retroactively, may include:

-

administrative,
                civil, and criminal penalties;

-

revocation
                of permits to conduct business; and

-

corrective
                action orders, including orders to investigate and/or clean-up
                contamination.

Failure
      on our part to comply with applicable environmental requirements could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We are also
      exposed to costs arising from environmental compliance, including compliance
      with changes in or expansion of environmental requirements, which could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results,
      or cash flows.

We
      are
      exposed to claims under environmental requirements, and, from time to time,
      such
      claims have been made against us. In the United States, environmental
      requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability. Strict liability
      means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up
      costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct
      that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or
      other third parties. Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental
      laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our
      consolidated results of operations.

Changes
      in environmental requirements may negatively impact demand for our services.
      For
      example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result
      of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to
      environmental concerns). A decline in exploration and production, in turn,
      could
      materially and adversely affect us.

Law
      and regulatory requirements

In
      the
      countries in which we conduct business, we are subject to multiple and at times
      inconsistent regulatory regimes, including those that govern our use of
      radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals in the course of our
      operations. Various national and international regulatory regimes govern the
      shipment of these items. Many countries, but not all, impose special controls
      upon the export and import of radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals.
      Our ability to do business is subject to maintaining required licenses and
      complying with these multiple regulatory requirements applicable to these
      special products. In addition, the various laws governing import and export
      of
      both products and technology apply to a wide range of services and products
      we
      offer. In turn, this can affect our employment practices of hiring people of
      different nationalities because these laws may prohibit or limit access to
      some
      products or technology by employees of various nationalities. Changes in,
      compliance with, or our failure to comply with these laws may negatively impact
      our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to, and transfer
      personnel or equipment among some of the countries in which we operate and
      could
      have a material adverse affect on the results of operations.

Raw
      materials

Raw
      materials essential to our business are normally readily available. Current
      market conditions have triggered constraints in the supply chain of certain
      raw
      materials, such as, sand, cement, and specialty metals. The majority of our
      risk
      associated with the current supply chain constraints occurs in those situations
      where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular
      resource.

Intellectual
      property rights

We
      rely
      on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and
      products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual
      property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated,
      circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries
      in
      which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property
      rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to
      protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property
      challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely
      affect our competitive position.


Technology

The
      market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological
      developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services.
      If we
      are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products
      and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in
      response to changes in technology, our business and revenue could be materially
      and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be
      reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment and facilities,
      or
      work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our
      business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

Systems

Our
      business could be materially and adversely affected by problems encountered
      in
      the installation of a new SAP financial system to replace the current systems
      for KBR.

Reliance
      on management

We
      depend
      greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to
      manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive
      officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
      business.

Technical
      personnel

Many
      of
      the services that we provide and the products that we sell are complex and
      highly engineered and often must perform or be performed in harsh conditions.
      We
      believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical
      personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these services and
      products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part
      on
      our ability to increase our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers
      is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid
      by
      competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force,
      increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events
      were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease,
      and our growth potential could be impaired.

Weather

Our
      businesses could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather,
      particularly in the Gulf of Mexico where we have operations. Repercussions
      of
      severe weather conditions may include:

-

evacuation
                of personnel and curtailment of
                services;

-

weather-related
                damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of
                operations;

-

weather-related
                damage to our facilities;

-

inability
                to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules;
                and

-

loss
                of productivity.

Because
      demand for natural gas in the United States drives a significant amount of
      our
      Energy Services Group’s United States business, warmer than normal winters in
      the United States are detrimental to the demand for our services to gas
      producers.


MANAGEMENT’S
      REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
      management of Halliburton Company is responsible for establishing and
      maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
      the
      Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal
      control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent
      limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
      provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
      preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over
      time.

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
      executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to
      assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
      of
      December 31, 2005 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of
      December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is
      effective.

Our
      assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
      as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by our independent registered public
      accounting firm, KPMG LLP.

Halliburton
      Company:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton Company
      and
      subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the related
      consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
      each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. These
      consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
      management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
      financial statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Halliburton Company and
      subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the results
      of
      their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
      period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Halliburton Company’s
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
      criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      and our report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
      management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
      over financial reporting.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Halliburton
      Company:

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Halliburton Company
      maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Halliburton Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
      effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
      on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Halliburton Company maintained effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
      stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Halliburton Company maintained, in all material
      respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31,
      2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by COSO.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton
      Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
      consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
      each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our
      report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
      consolidated financial statements.

HALLIBURTON
      COMPANY

Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Description of Company and Significant Accounting
      Policies

Description
      of Company

Halliburton
      Company’s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
      the State of Delaware in 1924. We are one of the world’s largest oilfield
      services companies and a leading provider of engineering and construction
      services. We have six business segments that are organized around how we manage
      our business: Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation
      Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions, collectively, the Energy
      Services Group (ESG); and Government and Infrastructure and Energy and
      Chemicals, collectively known as KBR. Through the ESG, we provide a
      comprehensive range of services and products for the exploration, development,
      and production of oil and gas. We serve major, national, and independent oil
      and
      gas companies throughout the world. KBR provides a wide range of services to
      energy, chemical, and industrial customers and to governmental entities
      worldwide.

Use
      of estimates

Our
      financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States, requiring us to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect:

-

the
                reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
                assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements;
                and

-

the
                reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
                period.

Ultimate
      results could differ from those estimates.

Basis
      of presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all
      of
      our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we
      have
      determined that we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 19). All material
      intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in companies
      in which we have significant influence are accounted for using the equity
      method. If we do not have significant influence, we use the cost
      method.

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
      presentation.

Revenue
      recognition

Overall.

Our
      service and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts
      with our customers that do not include right of return provisions or other
      significant post-delivery obligations. Our products are produced in a standard
      manufacturing operation, even if produced to our customer’s specifications. We
      recognize revenue from product sales when title passes to the customer, the
      customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, and collectibility is
      reasonably assured. Service revenues, including training and consulting
      services, are recognized when the services are rendered and collectibility
      is
      reasonably assured. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per
      meter, per man hour, or similar basis.

Software
      sales.

Sales of
      perpetual software licenses, net of any deferred maintenance and support fees,
      are recognized as revenue upon shipment. Sales of time-based licenses are
      recognized as revenue over the license period. Maintenance and support fees
      are
      recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period, usually a one-year
      duration.

Percentage-of-completion.

Revenue
      from contracts to provide construction, engineering, design, or similar
      services, almost all of which relates to KBR, is reported on the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Progress is generally based
      upon
      physical progress, man-hours, or costs incurred, depending on the type of job.
      All known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for when they become
      evident. Claims and change orders that are in the process of being negotiated
      with customers for extra work or changes in the scope of work are included
      in
      revenue when collection is deemed probable.


Accounting
      for government contracts.

Most of
      the services provided to the United States government are governed by
      cost-reimbursable contracts. Services under our LogCAP, PCO Oil South, and
      Balkans support contracts are examples of these types of arrangements.
      Generally, these contracts contain both a base fee (a fixed profit percentage
      applied to our actual costs to complete the work) and an award fee (a variable
      profit percentage applied to definitized costs, which is subject to our
      customer’s discretion and tied to the specific performance measures defined in
      the contract, such as adherence to schedule, health and safety, quality of
      work,
      responsiveness, cost performance, and business management). Similar to many
      cost-reimbursable contracts, these government contracts are typically subject
      to
      audit and adjustment by our customer.

Base
      fee
      revenue is recorded at the time services are performed, based upon actual
      project costs incurred, and includes a reimbursement fee for general,
      administrative, and overhead costs. The general, administrative, and overhead
      cost reimbursement fees are estimated periodically in accordance with government
      contract accounting regulations and may change based on actual costs incurred
      or
      based upon the volume of work performed. Revenue is reduced for our estimate
      of
      costs that may be categorized as disputed or unallowable as a result of cost
      overruns or the audit process.

Award
      fees are generally evaluated and granted periodically by our customer. For
      contracts entered into prior to June 30, 2003, award fees are recognized during
      the term of the contract based on our estimate of amounts to be awarded. Once
      award fees are granted and task orders underlying the work are definitized,
      we
      adjust our estimate of award fees to actual amounts earned. Our estimates are
      often based on our past award experience for similar types of work.

For
      contracts containing multiple deliverables entered into subsequent to June
      30,
      2003 (such as PCO Oil South), we analyze each activity within the contract
      to
      ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of Emerging Issues Task
      Force
      Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and the
      revenue recognition guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
      Recognition.” For service-only contracts and service elements of multiple
      deliverable arrangements, award fees are recognized only when definitized and
      awarded by the customer. Award fees on government construction contracts are
      recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount
      of fees to be awarded.

Research
      and development

Research
      and development expenses are charged to income as incurred. Research and
      development expenses were $220 million in 2005, $234 million in 2004, and $221
      million in 2003, of which over 97% was company-sponsored in each
      year.

Software
      development costs

Costs
      of
      developing software for sale are charged to expense as research and development
      when incurred until technological feasibility has been established for the
      product. Once technological feasibility is established, software development
      costs are capitalized until the software is ready for general release to
      customers. We capitalized costs related to software developed for resale of
      $21
      million in 2005, $16 million in 2004, and $17 million in 2003. Amortization
      expense of software development costs was $22 million for 2005 and 2004 and
      $17
      million for 2003. Once the software is ready for release, amortization of
      software development costs begins. Capitalized software development costs are
      amortized over periods not exceeding five years.

Cash
      equivalents

We
      consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
      or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost represents invoice or production
      cost for new items and original cost less allowance for condition for used
      material returned to stock. Production cost includes material, labor, and
      manufacturing overhead. Some domestic manufacturing and field service finished
      products and parts inventories for drill bits, completion products, and bulk
      materials are recorded using the last-in, first-out method. The remaining
      inventory is recorded on the average cost method.

Allowance
      for bad debts

We
      establish an allowance for bad debts through a review of several factors,
      including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer
      accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables
      involve retentions.


Property,
      plant, and equipment

Other
      than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to
      impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated
      depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over
      the
      estimated useful lives of the assets. Some assets are depreciated on accelerated
      methods. Accelerated depreciation methods are also used for tax purposes,
      wherever permitted. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs
      and
      accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
      is
      recognized. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and
      gas properties.

Goodwill

The
      reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment
      on an annual basis and more frequently when negative conditions such as
      significant current or projected operating losses exist. The annual impairment
      test for goodwill is a two-step process and involves comparing the estimated
      fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value,
      including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
      amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and the
      second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of
      a
      reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
      impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
      to
      be recorded, if any. Our annual impairment tests resulted in no goodwill
      impairment.

Evaluating
      impairment of long-lived assets

When
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than
      goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. For an asset classified
      as
      held for use, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with
      the
      asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down
      to fair value is required. When an asset is classified as held for sale, the
      asset’s book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount
      or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, depreciation and amortization
      is
      ceased while it is classified as held for sale.

Income
      taxes

We
      recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. In addition,
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
      tax
      consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
      or
      tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it
      is
      more likely than not that these items will not be realized.

In
      assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
      it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
      will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
      dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
      which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
      scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
      and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level
      of
      historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
      periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes
      it
      is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible
      differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

We
      generally do not provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
      non-United States subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be
      reinvested indefinitely to finance foreign activities. Taxes are provided as
      necessary with respect to earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The
      American Job Creations Act of 2004 introduced a special dividends received
      deduction with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
      United States taxpayer under certain circumstances. Based on our analysis of
      the
      Act, we decided not to utilize the special deduction.

Derivative
      instruments

At
      times,
      we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected
      exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
      commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative
      or trading purposes. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
      value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected
      through the results of operations. If the derivative is designated as a hedge,
      depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives
      are either offset against:

-

the
                change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
                commitments through earnings; or

-

recognized
                in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized
                in
                earnings.


The
      ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in
      earnings. Recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage
      foreign exchange risk are included in foreign currency gains and losses in
      the
      consolidated statements of income. Gains or losses on interest rate derivatives
      are included in interest expense, and gains or losses on commodity derivatives
      are included in operating income.

Foreign
      currency translation

Foreign
      entities whose functional currency is the United States dollar translate
      monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary
      items are translated at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are
      translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for
      depreciation, cost of product sales and revenue, and expenses associated with
      nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates.
      Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are recognized in consolidated
      income in the year of occurrence. Foreign entities whose functional currency
      is
      not the United States dollar translate net assets at year-end rates and income
      and expense accounts at average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from
      these
      translations are reflected in the consolidated statements of shareholders’
equity as cumulative translation adjustments.

Stock-based
      compensation

At
      December 31, 2005, we have six stock-based employee compensation plans. We
      account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
      Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
      to Employees,” and related Interpretations. No cost for stock options granted is
      reflected in net income, as all options granted under our plans have an exercise
      price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date
      of
      grant. In addition, no cost for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is
      reflected in net income because it is not considered a compensatory
      plan.

The
      fair
      value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
      option pricing model. The weighted average assumptions and resulting fair values
      of options granted are as follows:

Included
      in the pro forma compensation table below is the fair value of the ESPP shares.
      The fair value of these shares was estimated using the Black-Scholes model
      with
      the following assumptions for 2005: risk-free interest rate of 4.4%; expected
      dividend yield of 0.8%; expected life of six months; and expected volatility
      of
      34%.

The
      following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and income (loss)
      per share had we applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

We
      also
      maintain a restricted stock program wherein the fair market value of the stock
      on the date of grant is amortized and ratably charged to income over the period
      during which the restrictions lapse. The related expense, net of tax, reflected
      in net income (loss) as reported was $20 million in 2005, $14 million in 2004,
      and $13 million in 2003.

See
      Note
      14 for further detail on stock incentive plans.

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
      No.
      123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and
      supersedes APB No. 25. In April 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange
      Commission (SEC) adopted a rule that defers the required effective date of
      SFAS
      No. 123R. The SEC rule provides that SFAS No. 123R is now effective for
      registrants as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June
      15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 using
      the modified prospective application. Accordingly, we will recognize
      compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified,
      repurchased, or cancelled after January 1, 2006. Compensation expense for the
      unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of January 1, 2006 will
      be
      recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value
      at
      date of grant as calculated under the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
      Compensation expense related to the unvested portion of these awards will be
      consistent with compensation expense included in our pro forma disclosure under
      SFAS No. 123. We will recognize compensation expense using the Black-Scholes
      pricing model for our ESPP beginning with the January 1, 2006 purchase
      period.

We
      estimate that the effect on earnings per share in the periods following adoption
      of SFAS No. 123R will be a reduction of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 in net
      income per diluted share per quarter. This effect is consistent with our pro
      forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 except that estimated forfeitures will
      be
      considered in the calculation of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R.
      Additionally, the actual effect on net income and earnings per share will vary
      depending upon the number of options granted in subsequent periods compared
      to
      prior years and the number of shares purchased under the ESPP.

Note
      2. Percentage-of-Completion Contracts

Revenue
      from contracts to provide construction, engineering, design, or similar services
      is reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting using
      measurements of progress toward completion appropriate for the work performed.
      Commonly used measurements are physical progress, man-hours, and costs
      incurred.


Billing
      practices for these projects are governed by the contract terms of each project
      based upon costs incurred, achievement of milestones, or pre-agreed schedules.
      Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognized under the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Billings in excess of recognized
      revenue are recorded in “Advance billings on uncompleted contracts.” When
      billings are less than recognized revenue, the difference is recorded in
“Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts.” With the exception of claims and
      change orders that are in the process of being negotiated with customers,
      unbilled work is usually billed during normal billing processes following
      achievement of the contractual requirements.

Recording
      of profits and losses on percentage-of-completion contracts requires an estimate
      of the total profit or loss over the life of each contract. This estimate
      requires consideration of contract revenue, change orders and claims reduced
      by
      costs incurred, and estimated costs to complete. Anticipated losses on contracts
      are recorded in full in the period they become evident. Except in a limited
      number of projects that have significant uncertainties in the estimation of
      costs, we do not delay income recognition until projects have reached a
      specified percentage of completion. Generally, profits are recorded from the
      commencement date of the contract based upon the total estimated contract profit
      multiplied by the current percentage complete for the contract.

When
      calculating the amount of total profit or loss on a percentage-of-completion
      contract, we include unapproved claims as revenue when the collection is deemed
      probable based upon the four criteria for recognizing unapproved claims under
      the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
      81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
      Production-Type Contracts.” Including unapproved claims in this calculation
      increases the operating income (or reduces the operating loss) that would
      otherwise be recorded without consideration of the probable unapproved claims.
      Probable unapproved claims are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and
      include no profit element. In all cases, the probable unapproved claims included
      in determining contract profit or loss are less than the actual claim that
      will
      be or has been presented to the customer.

When
      recording the revenue and the associated unbilled receivable for unapproved
      claims, we only accrue an amount equal to the costs incurred related to probable
      unapproved claims. Therefore, the difference between the probable unapproved
      claims included in determining contract profit or loss and the probable
      unapproved claims accrued revenue recorded in unbilled work on uncompleted
      contracts relates to forecasted costs which have not yet been incurred. The
      amounts included in determining the profit or loss on contracts and the amounts
      booked to “Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts” or “Other assets” as of
      December 31 for each period are as follows:

Probable
                unapproved claims from unconsolidated related companies




As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the probable unapproved claims, including those from
      unconsolidated related companies relate to six contracts, most of which are
      complete or substantially complete. See Note 11 for a discussion of government
      contract claims, which are not included in the table above.

A
      significant portion of the probable unapproved claims as of December 31, 2005
      ($150 million related to our consolidated entities and $45 million related
      to
      our unconsolidated related companies) arose from three completed projects with
      Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) that are currently subject to arbitration
      proceedings. In addition, we have “Other assets” of $64 million for previously
      approved services that are unpaid by PEMEX and have been included in these
      arbitration proceedings. Actual amounts we are seeking from PEMEX in the
      arbitration proceedings are in excess of these amounts. The arbitration
      proceedings are expected to extend through 2007. PEMEX has asserted unspecified
      counterclaims in each of the three arbitrations; however, it is premature based
      upon our current understanding of those counterclaims to make any assessment
      of
      their merits. As of December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts related
      to
      the counterclaims in the arbitrations.


We
      have
      contracts with probable unapproved claims that will likely not be settled within
      one year totaling $172 million at December 31, 2005 and $153 million at December
      31, 2004 included in the table above, which are reflected as “Other assets” on
      the consolidated balance sheets. Other probable unapproved claims that we
      believe will be settled within one year, included in the table above, have
      been
      recorded to “Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts” on the consolidated balance
      sheets. Our unconsolidated related companies include probable unapproved claims
      as revenue to determine the amount of profit or loss for their contracts.
      Probable unapproved claims from our related companies are included in “Equity in
      and advances to related companies.”

Unapproved
      change orders

We
      have
      other contracts for which we are negotiating change orders to the contract
      scope
      and have agreed upon the scope of work but not the price. These change orders
      amounted to $61 million at December 31, 2005. Unapproved change orders at
      December 31, 2004 were $43 million. Our share of change orders from
      unconsolidated related companies totaled $5 million at December 31, 2005 and
      $37
      million at December 31, 2004.

Barracuda-Caratinga
      project

Following
      is the status, as of December 31, 2005, of our Barracuda-Caratinga project,
      a
      multiyear construction project to develop the Barracuda and Caratinga crude
      oilfields located off the coast of Brazil:

-

the
                project was approximately 98%
                complete;

-

we
                recorded losses on this project of $407 million in 2004 and $238
                million
                in 2003;

-

the
                losses recorded include $22 million in liquidated damages paid in
                based on our agreement with
                Petrobras;

-

the
                $300 million of advance payments received from our customer have
                been
                completely repaid; and

-

we
                have received $138 million related to approved change
                orders.

The
      Barracuda and Caratinga vessels are both fully operational. We reached agreement
      with Petrobras, subject to Lender's consent that enables us to achieve
      conclusion of the Lenders' Reliability Test and final acceptance of the
      FPSOs.  These acceptances eliminate any further risk of liquidated damages
      being assessed.  Pursuant to the agreed terms, FPSO Final Acceptance will
      occur during the first quarter of 2006.

In
        addition, at Petrobras’ direction, we have replaced certain bolts located on the
        subsea flow-lines that have failed through mid-November 2005, and we understand
        that additional bolts have failed thereafter, which have been replaced by
        Petrobras. These failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted
        inspections of the bolts. The original design specification for the bolts
        was
        issued by Petrobras, and as such, we believe the cost resulting from any
        replacement is not our responsibility. Petrobras has indicated, however,
        that
        they do not agree with our conclusion.  We have notified Petrobras that
        this matter is in dispute.  We believe several possible solutions may
        exist, including replacement of the bolts.  Estimates indicate that
        costs of these variouis solutions range up to $140 million.  Should
        Petrobras instruct us to replace the subsea bolts, the prime contract terms
        and
        conditions regarding change orders require that Petrobras make progress payments
        of our reasonable costs incurred. Petrobras could, however, perform any
        replacement of the bolts and seek reimbursement from KBR.  On March 9,
        2006 Petrobras notified KBR that they have submitted this matter to arbitration
        claiming $220 million plus interest for the cost of monitoring and replacing
        the
        defective stud bolts and, in addition, all of the costs and expenses of the
        arbitration including the cost of attorneys fees.  We do not understand the
        basis for the amount claimed by Petrobras.  We intend to vigorously defend
        ourselves and pursue recovery of the costs we have incurred to date through
        the
        arbitration process.

We
      continue to fund operating cash shortfalls on this project and estimate that
      we
      will pay approximately $12 million during 2006, which represents remaining
      project costs, net of revenue to be received.


Note
      3. Acquisitions and Dispositions

Dulles
      Greenway Toll Road

As
      part
      of our infrastructure projects, we occasionally take an ownership interest
      in
      the constructed asset, with a view toward monetization of that ownership
      interest after the asset has been operating for some period and increases in
      value. In September 2005, we sold our 13% interest in a joint venture that
      owned
      the Dulles Greenway Toll Road in Virginia. We received $85 million in cash
      from
      the sale. Because of unfavorable early projections of traffic to support the
      toll road after it had opened, we wrote down our investment in the toll road
      in
      1996. At the time of the sale, our investment had a net book value of zero,
      and
      therefore, we recorded the entire $85 million of cash proceeds to operating
      income in our Government and Infrastructure segment.

Subsea
      7, Inc.

In
      January 2005, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in Subsea 7, Inc. to
      our
      joint venture partner, Siem Offshore (formerly DSND Subsea ASA), for
      approximately $200 million in cash. As a result of the transaction, we recorded
      a gain of approximately $110 million during the first quarter of 2005. We
      accounted for our 50% ownership of Subsea 7, Inc. using the equity method in
      our
      Production Optimization segment.

Surface
      Well Testing

In
      August
      2004, we sold our surface well testing and subsea test tree operations within
      our Production Optimization segment to Power Well Service Holdings, LLC, an
      affiliate of First Reserve Corporation, for approximately $129 million, of
      which
      we received $126 million in cash. During 2004, we recorded a $54 million gain
      on
      the sale.

Enventure
      and WellDynamics

In
      the
      first quarter of 2004, Halliburton and Shell Technology Ventures (Shell, an
      unrelated party) restructured two joint venture companies, Enventure Global
      Technology LLC (Enventure) and WellDynamics B.V. (WellDynamics), in an effort
      to
      more closely align the ventures with near-term priorities in the core businesses
      of the venture owners. Prior to this transaction, Enventure (part of our Fluid
      Systems segment) and WellDynamics (formerly part of our Digital and Consulting
      Solutions segment) were owned equally by Shell and us. Shell acquired an
      additional 33.5% of Enventure, leaving us with 16.5% ownership in return for
      enhanced and extended agreements and licenses with Shell for its Poroflex™
expandable sand screens and a distribution agreement for its Versaflex™
expandable liner hangers. As a result of this transaction, we changed the way
      we
      account for our ownership in Enventure from the equity method to the cost method
      of accounting for investments. We acquired an additional 1% of WellDynamics
      from
      Shell, giving us 51% ownership and control of day-to-day operations. In
      addition, Shell received an option to obtain our remaining interest in Enventure
      for an additional 14% interest in WellDynamics. No gain or loss resulted from
      the transaction. Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, WellDynamics was
      consolidated and is now included in our Production Optimization segment. The
      consolidation of WellDynamics resulted in an increase to our goodwill of $109
      million, which was previously carried as equity method goodwill in “Equity in
      and advances to related companies.”

Halliburton
      Measurement Systems

In
      May
      2003, we sold certain assets of Halliburton Measurement Systems, which provides
      flow measurement and sampling systems, to NuFlo Technologies, Inc. for
      approximately $33 million in cash. The gain on the sale of Halliburton
      Measurement Systems’ assets was $24 million and was included in our Production
      Optimization segment.

Wellstream

In
      March
      2003, we sold the assets relating to our Wellstream business, a global provider
      of flexible pipe products, systems, and solutions, to Candover Partners Ltd.
      for
      $136 million in cash. The assets sold included manufacturing plants in Newcastle
      upon Tyne, United Kingdom, and Panama City, Florida, as well as assets and
      contracts in Brazil. Wellstream had $34 million in goodwill recorded at the
      disposition date. The transaction resulted in a loss of $15 million, which
      was
      included in our Digital and Consulting Solutions segment. Included in the loss
      is the write-off of the cumulative translation adjustment related to Wellstream
      of approximately $9 million.


Mono
      Pumps

In
      January 2003, we sold our Mono Pumps business to National Oilwell, Inc. The
      sale
      price of approximately $88 million was paid with $23 million in cash and 3.2
      million shares of National Oilwell, Inc. common stock, which were valued at
      $65
      million on January 15, 2003. We recorded a gain of $36 million on the sale
      in
      the first quarter of 2003, which was included in our Drilling and Formation
      Evaluation segment. Included in the gain was the write-off of the cumulative
      translation adjustment related to Mono Pumps of approximately $5 million. In
      February 2003, we sold 2.5 million of our 3.2 million shares of National
      Oilwell, Inc. common stock for $52 million, which resulted in a gain of $2
      million, and in February 2004, we sold the remaining shares for $20 million,
      resulting in a gain of $6 million. The gains related to the sale of the National
      Oilwell, Inc. common stock were recorded in “Other, net.”

Note
      4. Business Segment Information

During
      the second quarter of 2003, we restructured our Energy Services Group into
      four
      segments, and, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we restructured KBR into two
      segments, which form the basis for the six segments we now report. The segments
      mirror the way our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the
      operating results, assesses performance, and allocates resources.

Energy
      Services Group

Following
      is a summary of our Energy Services Group segments.

Production
      Optimization.

The
      Production Optimization segment primarily tests, measures, and provides means
      to
      manage and/or improve well production once a well is drilled and, in some cases,
      after it has been producing. This segment consists of production enhancement
      services and completion tools and services.

Production
      enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
      sand control services, coiled tubing tools and services, and hydraulic workover
      services. Stimulation services optimize oil and gas reservoir production through
      a variety of pressure pumping services and chemical processes, commonly known
      as
      fracturing and acidizing. Pipeline process services include pipeline and
      facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping, chemical
      systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the midstream
      and downstream sectors of the energy business. Sand control services include
      fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the prevention of formation
      sand production.

Completion
      tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
      surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
      completion systems, production automation, expandable liner hanger systems,
      sand
      control systems, slickline equipment and services, self-elevated workover
      platforms, tubing-conveyed perforating services and products, well servicing
      tools, and reservoir performance services. Reservoir performance services
      include drill stem and other well testing tools and services, underbalanced
      applications and real-time reservoir analysis, data acquisition services, and
      production applications.

Also
      included in the Production Optimization segment are WellDynamics, an intelligent
      well completions joint venture, which was consolidated beginning in the first
      quarter of 2004, and, until January 2005, subsea operations conducted by Subsea
      7, Inc., of which we formerly owned 50% and accounted for it using the equity
      method.

Fluid
      Systems.

The
      Fluid Systems segment focuses on providing services and technologies to assist
      in the drilling and construction of oil and gas wells. This segment consists
      of:

-

cementing
                services, which involve the process used to bond the well and well
                casing
                while isolating fluid zones and maximizing wellbore stability. Our
                cementing service line also provides casing equipment and
                services;

-

Within
      the Energy Services Group and KBR, not all assets are associated with specific
      segments. Those assets specific to segments include receivables, inventories,
      certain identified property, plant, and equipment (including field service
      equipment), equity in and advances to related companies, and goodwill. The
      remaining assets, such as cash are considered to be shared among the segments
      within the two groups. For segment operating income presentation, the
      depreciation expense associated with these shared KBR assets is allocated to
      the
      two segments under KBR.

Note
      5. Receivables (Other than “Insurance for asbestos- and silica-related
      liabilities”)

Our
      receivables are generally not collateralized. At December 31, 2005, 38% of
      our
      consolidated receivables related to our United States government contracts,
      primarily for projects in the Middle East. Receivables from the United States
      government at December 31, 2004 represented 39% of consolidated
      receivables.

Under
      an
      agreement to sell United States Energy Services Group accounts receivable to
      a
      bankruptcy-remote limited-purpose funding subsidiary, new receivables were
      added
      on a continuous basis to the pool of receivables. Collections reduced previously
      sold accounts receivable. This funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership
      interest in this pool of receivables to entities managed by unaffiliated
      financial institutions under another agreement. Sales to the funding subsidiary
      were structured as “true sales” under applicable bankruptcy laws. While the
      funding subsidiary was wholly owned by us, its assets were not available to
      pay
      any creditors of ours or of our subsidiaries or affiliates. The undivided
      ownership interest in the pool of receivables sold to the unaffiliated
      companies, therefore, was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in
      our
      consolidated balance sheets. The funding subsidiary retained the interest in
      the
      pool of receivables that were not sold to the unaffiliated companies and was
      fully consolidated and reported in our financial statements.

The
      amount of undivided interests which could be sold under the program varied
      based
      on the amount of eligible Energy Services Group receivables in the pool at
      any
      given time and other factors. The maximum amount that could be sold and
      outstanding under this agreement at any given time was $300 million. As of
      December 31, 2004, we had sold $256 million of undivided ownership interest
      to
      unaffiliated companies. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these receivables
      were collected and the balance retired. No further receivables were sold, and
      the facility was terminated subsequent to December 31, 2005.

In
      May
      2004, we entered into an agreement to sell, assign, and transfer the entire
      title and interest in specified United States government accounts receivable
      of
      KBR to a third party. The face value of the receivables sold to the third party
      was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance
      sheets. The amount of receivables that could be sold under the agreement varied
      based on the amount of eligible receivables at any given time and other factors,
      and the maximum amount that could be sold and outstanding under this agreement
      at any given time was $650 million. The total amount of receivables outstanding
      under this agreement as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $263 million.
      As
      of December 31, 2005, these receivables were collected, the balance was retired,
      and the facility was terminated.

Note
      6. Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market. We manufacture in the United States
      certain finished products and parts inventories for drill bits, completion
      products, bulk materials, and other tools that are recorded using the last-in,
      first-out method, which totaled $42 million at December 31, 2005 and $37 million
      at December 31, 2004. If the average cost method had been used, total
      inventories would have been $21 million higher than reported at December 31,
      2005 and $17 million higher than reported at December 31, 2004. The cost of
      the
      remaining inventory was recorded on the average cost method. Inventories at
      December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were composed of the
      following:

Note
      7. Investments

Investments
      in marketable securities

Our
      investments in marketable securities are reported at fair value. At December
      31,
      2004, our investments in marketable securities consisted of auction rate
      securities classified as available-for-sale. The 2004 balance of the auction
      rate securities was previously classified as cash and equivalents due to our
      intent and ability to quickly liquidate these securities to fund current
      operations and due to their interest rate reset feature. The auction rate
      securities were reclassified as investments in marketable securities. There
      was
      no impact on net income or cash flow from operating activities as a result
      of
      the reclassification. These auction rate securities were liquidated in March
      2005.

Restricted
      cash

At
      December 31, 2005, we had restricted cash of $123 million in “Other assets,”
which consisted of:

-

$100
                million as collateral for potential future insurance claim reimbursements;
                and

-

$23
                million related to cash collateral agreements for outstanding letters
                of
                credit for various construction
                projects.

At
      December 31, 2004, we had restricted cash of $121 million in “Other assets” and
      $17 million in “Other current assets,” which consisted of similar items as
      above.

Note
      8. Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property,
      plant, and equipment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were composed of the

In
      the
      second quarter of 2004, we implemented a change in accounting estimate to more
      accurately reflect the useful life of some of the tools of our Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation segment. This resulted in a combined $35 million reduction
      in depreciation expense in the last three quarters of 2004, thereby reducing
      our
      consolidated net loss by $22 million, or $0.05 per share, for 2004. We extended
      the useful lives of these tools based on our review of their service lives,
      technological improvements in the tools, and recent changes to our repair and
      maintenance practices which helped to extend the lives.

Convertible
      notes

In
      June
      2003, we issued $1.2 billion of 3.125% convertible senior notes due July 15,
      2023, with interest payable semiannually. The notes are our senior unsecured
      obligations ranking equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured
      indebtedness.

The
      notes
      are convertible under any of the following circumstances:

-

during
                any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common
                stock
                for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive
                trading
                days ending on the last trading day of the previous quarter is greater
                than or equal to 120% of the conversion price per share of our common
                stock on such last trading day. This circumstance was achieved in
                the
                third and fourth quarters of 2005. There were no conversions of these
                notes as of February 15, 2006;

-

if
                the notes have been called for
                redemption;

-

upon
                the occurrence of specified corporate transactions that are described
                in
                the indenture relating to the offering;
                or

-

during
                any period in which the credit ratings assigned to the notes by both
                Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s are lower than Ba1 and
                BB+, respectively, or the notes are no longer rated by at least one
                of
                these rating services or their
                successors.

The
      initial conversion price is $37.65 per share and is subject to adjustment upon
      the occurrence of stock dividends in common stock, the issuance of rights or
      warrants, stock splits and combinations, the distribution of indebtedness,
      securities, or assets, or excess cash distributions.

Upon
      conversion, we must settle the principal amount of the notes in cash, and for
      any amounts in excess of the aggregate principal we have the right to deliver
      shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common
      stock.

See
      Note
      16 for discussion of supplemental indenture on these notes.

The
      notes
      are redeemable for cash at our option on or after July 15, 2008. Holders may
      require us to repurchase the notes for cash on July 15 of 2008, 2013, or 2018
      or, prior to July 15, 2008, in the event of a fundamental change as defined
      in
      the underlying indenture.


Senior
      notes due 2007

In
      January 2004, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
      due 2007 bearing interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR (London
      interbank offered rates) plus 0.75%, payable quarterly. In April 2005, we
      redeemed, at par plus accrued interest, all $500 million of these senior
      notes.

Floating-
      and fixed-rate senior notes

In
      October 2003, we completed an offering of $1.05 billion of floating- and
      fixed-rate unsecured senior notes. The fixed-rate notes, with an aggregate
      principal amount of $750 million, will mature on October 15, 2010 and bear
      interest at a rate equal to 5.5%, payable semiannually. The fixed-rate notes
      were initially offered on a discounted basis at 99.679% of their face value.
      The
      discount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds.
      The
      floating-rate notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $300 million and
      interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.5%, were repaid at par
      plus
      accrued interest in October 2005.

Medium-term
      notes

We
      have
      outstanding notes under our medium-term note program as follows:

At
      December 31, 2005, the $275 million 6.00% medium-term notes due August 2006
      were
      included in “Current maturities of long-term debt” in the consolidated balance
      sheet. We may redeem the 6.00% and 5.63% medium-term notes in whole or in part
      at any time subject to a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the
      principal amount of such notes or the sum of the present values of the remaining
      scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
      redemption date at the treasury rate plus 15 basis points. The 7.53% notes
      may
      not be redeemed prior to maturity. Each holder of the 6.75% medium-term notes
      has the right to require us to repay their notes in whole or in part on February
      1, 2007. The medium-term notes do not have sinking fund requirements and rank
      equally with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.

Revolving
      credit facilities

In
      March
      2005, we entered into a $1.2 billion variable rate, five-year unsecured
      revolving credit agreement, which replaced a secured $700 million three-year
      revolving credit facility and a secured $500 million 364-day revolving credit
      facility. The letter of credit outstanding under the previous $700 million
      revolving credit facility is now outstanding under our $1.2 billion revolving
      credit agreement and had a balance of $107 million as of December 31, 2005.
      As
      of December 31, 2005, approximately $1.1 billion was available for borrowing
      under the $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement, but no borrowings had been
      made.

KBR
      entered into an unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility
      in
      the fourth quarter of 2005. Three letters of credit that totaled $25 million
      were subsequently issued under the KBR revolving credit facility, thus reducing
      the availability under the credit facility to approximately $825 million at
      December 31, 2005. There were no cash drawings under the unsecured $850 million
      revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2005.

Debt
      covenants

Letters
      of credit related to our Barracuda-Caratinga project and our $1.2 billion
      revolving credit facility contain restrictive covenants, including covenants
      that require us to maintain certain financial ratios as defined by the
      agreements. For the letters of credit related to our Barracuda-Caratinga
      project, we are required to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage
      ratios. We are also required to maintain a minimum debt-to-capitalization ratio
      under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2005, we
      were
      in compliance with these requirements.

In
      addition, the unsecured $850 million five-year revolving letter of credit
      facility entered into by KBR contains covenants including a limitation on the
      amount KBR can invest in unconsolidated subsidiaries. KBR must also maintain
      certain financial ratios including a debt-to-capitalization ratio, a leverage
      ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, KBR was in
      compliance with these requirements.


Maturities

Our
      debt,
      excluding the effects of our terminated interest rate swaps of $2 million,
      matures as follows: $359 million in 2006; $31 million in 2007; $152 million
      in
      2008; $1 million in 2009; $750 million in 2010; and $1,879 million
      thereafter.

Note
      10. Asbestos and Silica Obligations and Insurance
      Recoveries

Several
      of our subsidiaries, particularly DII Industries and Kellogg Brown & Root,
      had been named as defendants in a large number of asbestos- and silica-related
      lawsuits. The plaintiffs’ alleged injuries were primarily a result of exposure
      to:

-

asbestos
                used in products manufactured or sold by former divisions of DII
                Industries (primarily refractory materials, gaskets, and packing
                materials
                used in pumps and other industrial
                products);

-

asbestos
                in materials used in the construction and maintenance projects of
                Kellogg
                Brown & Root or its subsidiaries;
                and

-

silica
                related to sandblasting and drilling fluids
                operations.

Effective
      December 31, 2004, we resolved all open and future claims in the prepackaged
      Chapter 11 proceedings of DII Industries, Kellogg Brown & Root, and our
      other affected subsidiaries (which were filed on December 16, 2003) upon the
      plan of reorganization becoming final and nonappealable. The following table
      presents a rollforward of our asbestos- and silica-related liabilities and
      insurance receivables.

In
      accordance with the plan of reorganization, in January 2005 we contributed
      the
      following to trusts for the benefit of current and future asbestos and silica
      personal injury claimants:

-

approximately
                $2.345 billion in cash, which represents the remaining portion of
                the
                $2.775 billion total cash settlement after payments of $311 million
                in
                December 2003 and $119 million in June
                2004;

-

59.5
                million shares of Halliburton common
                stock;

-

a
                one-year non-interest-bearing note of $31 million for the benefit
                of
                asbestos claimants. We prepaid the initial installment on the note
                of
                approximately $8 million in January 2005 and paid an additional $15
                million during the third quarter of 2005. The final payment on the
                note of
                approximately $8 million was made in the fourth quarter of 2005;
                and


-

a
                silica note for the benefit of silica claimants. The note provides
                that we
                will contribute an amount to the silica trust at the end of each
                year for
                the next 30 years of up to $15 million. The note also provides for
                an
                extension of the note for 20 additional years under certain circumstances.
                As of December 31, 2005, we estimated the value of this note plus
                the
                initial cash payment of $15 million, paid in January 2005, to be
                approximately $24 million. We will periodically reassess our valuation
                of
                this note based upon our projections of the amounts we believe we
                will be
                required to fund into the silica
                trust.

Our
      plan
      of reorganization called for a portion of our total asbestos liability to be
      settled by contributing 59.5 million shares of Halliburton common stock to
      the
      trust. In 2004, we revalued the 59.5 million shares to $2.335 billion ($39.24
      per share) at December 31, 2004 from approximately $1.6 billion ($26.27 per
      share) at December 31, 2003, resulting in charges to discontinued operations
      totaling $778 million. Effective December 31, 2004, concurrent with receiving
      final and nonappealable confirmation of our plan of reorganization, we
      reclassified from a long-term liability to shareholders’ equity the final value
      of the 59.5 million shares of Halliburton common stock to be contributed to
      the
      asbestos trust. In January 2005, when the 59.5 million shares were actually
      contributed to the trust, the $2.335 billion value of the common shares was
      reclassified to common stock and paid-in capital in excess of par value on
      the
      consolidated balance sheets.

      settlements

During
      2004, we settled insurance disputes with substantially all the insurance
      companies for asbestos- and silica-related claims and all other claims under
      the
      applicable insurance policies and terminated all the applicable insurance
      policies. Under the terms of our insurance settlements, we would receive cash
      proceeds with a nominal amount of approximately $1.5 billion and with a then
      present value of approximately $1.4 billion for our asbestos- and silica-related
      insurance receivables. The present value was determined by discounting the
      expected future cash payments with a discount rate implicit in the settlements,
      which ranged from 4.0% to 5.5%. This discount is being accreted as interest
      income (classified as discontinued operations) over the life of the expected
      future cash payments. Cash payments of approximately $1.032 billion related
      to
      these receivables were received in 2005. Under the terms of the settlement
      agreements, we will receive cash payments of the remaining amounts, totaling
      $427 million at December 31, 2005, in several installments through
      2010.

A
      significant portion of the insurance coverage applicable to Worthington Pump,
      a
      former division of DII Industries, was alleged by Federal-Mogul (and others
      who
      formerly were associated with Worthington Pump prior to its acquisition by
      DII
      Industries) to be shared with them. During 2004, we reached an agreement with
      Federal-Mogul, our insurance companies, and another party sharing in the
      insurance coverage to obtain their consent and support of a partitioning of
      the
      insurance policies. Under the terms of the agreement, DII Industries was
      allocated 50% of the limits of any applicable insurance policy, and the
      remaining 50% of limits of the insurance policies were allocated to the
      remaining policyholders. As part of the settlement, DII Industries agreed to
      pay
      $46 million in three installment payments. In 2004, we accrued $44 million,
      which represents the present value of the $46 million to be paid. The discount
      is accreted as interest expense (classified as discontinued operations) over
      the
      life of the expected future cash payments beginning in the fourth quarter of
      2004. The first payment of $16 million was paid in January 2005, and the second
      payment of $15 million was paid in January 2006. The third and final payment
      of
      $15 million will be made in January 2007.

DII
      Industries and Federal-Mogul agreed to share equally in recoveries from
      insolvent London-based insurance companies. To the extent that Federal-Mogul’s
      recoveries from certain insolvent London-based insurance companies received
      on
      or before January 1, 2006 did not equal at least $4.5 million, DII Industries
      agreed to also pay to Federal-Mogul the difference between their recoveries
      from
      the insolvent London-based insurance companies and $4.5 million. Accordingly,
      DII Industries paid Federal-Mogul $1.6 million in January 2006. This amount
      is
      expected to be received back from Federal-Mogul following any recoveries
      received by Federal-Mogul from the insolvent London-based insurance companies
      after January 1, 2006.

Under
      the
      insurance settlements entered into as part of the resolution of our Chapter
      proceedings, we have agreed to indemnify our insurers under certain historic
      general liability insurance policies in certain situations. We have concluded
      that the likelihood of any claims triggering the indemnity obligations is
      remote, and we believe any potential liability for these indemnifications will
      be immaterial. At December 31, 2005, we had not recorded any liability
      associated with these indemnifications.


Note
      11. United States Government Contract Work

We
      provide substantial work under our government contracts to the United States
      Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. These contracts include
      our worldwide United States Army logistics contracts, known as LogCAP, and
      contracts to rebuild Iraq’s petroleum industry, such as PCO Oil South. Our
      government services revenue related to Iraq totaled approximately $5.4 billion
      in 2005, $7.1 billion in 2004, and $3.6 billion in 2003.

Given
      the
      demands of working in Iraq and elsewhere for the United States government,
      we
      expect that from time to time we will have disagreements or experience
      performance issues with the various government customers for which we work.
      If
      performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government
      retains the right to pursue remedies which could include threatened termination
      or termination, under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated,
      we may not receive award fees under the affected contract, and our ability
      to
      secure future contracts could be adversely affected, although we would receive
      payment for amounts owed for our allowable costs under cost-reimbursable
      contracts. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers
      for
      any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as
      forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or
      debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative
      publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions
      as
      a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry,
      reduce our ability to compete for new contracts, and may also have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
      and
      cash flow.

DCAA
      audit issues

Our
      operations under United States government contracts are regularly reviewed
      and
      audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and other governmental
      agencies. The DCAA serves in an advisory role to our customer. When issues
      are
      found during the governmental agency audit process, these issues are typically
      discussed and reviewed with us. The DCAA then issues an audit report with its
      recommendations to our customer’s contracting officer. In the case of management
      systems and other contract administrative issues, the contracting officer is
      generally with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). We then work
      with
      our customer to resolve the issues noted in the audit report. If our customer
      or
      a government auditor finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract,
      these costs are not reimbursable, or, if already reimbursed, the costs must
      be
      refunded to the customer.

Dining
      facilities (DFAC).

During
      2003, the DCAA raised issues related to our invoicing to the Army Materiel
      Command (AMC) for food services for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel
      in Iraq and Kuwait. During 2004, we received notice from the DCAA that it was
      recommending withholding 19.35% of our DFAC billings relating to subcontracts
      entered into prior to February 2004 until it completed its audits. Approximately
      $213 million had been withheld as of March 31, 2005. Subsequent to February
      2004, we renegotiated our DFAC subcontracts to address the specific issues
      raised by the DCAA and advised the AMC and the DCAA of the new terms of the
      arrangements. We have had no objection by the government to the terms and
      conditions associated with our new DFAC subcontract agreements. On March 31,
      2005, we reached an agreement with the AMC regarding the costs associated with
      the DFAC subcontractors, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion. Under the
      terms of the agreement, the AMC agreed to the DFAC subcontractor costs except
      for $55 million, which it retained from the $213 million previously withheld
      amount. In the second quarter of 2005, the government released the funds to
      KBR.

During
      2005, we reached settlement agreements with all but one subcontractor, Eurest
      Support Services (Cyprus) International Limited, or ESS, and resolved $44
      million of the $55 million disallowed DFAC subcontractor costs. Accordingly,
      we
      paid the amounts due to all subcontractors with whom settlements have been
      finalized, in accordance with the agreement reached with the government, but
      withheld the remaining $11 million pending settlement with ESS. On September
      30,
      2005, ESS filed suit against us alleging various claims associated with its
      performance as a subcontractor in conjunction with our LogCAP contract in Iraq.
      The case was settled during the first quarter of 2006 without material impact
      to
      us.


Fuel.

In
      December 2003, the DCAA issued a preliminary audit report that alleged that
      we
      may have overcharged the Department of Defense by $61 million in importing
      fuel
      into Iraq. The DCAA questioned costs associated with fuel purchases made in
      Kuwait that were more expensive than buying and transporting fuel from Turkey.
      We responded that we had maintained close coordination of the fuel mission
      with
      the Army Corps of Engineers (COE), which was our customer and oversaw the
      project throughout the life of the task orders, and that the COE had directed
      us
      to use the Kuwait sources. After a review, the COE concluded that we obtained
      a
      fair price for the fuel. Nonetheless, Department of Defense officials referred
      the matter to the agency’s inspector general, which we understand commenced an
      investigation.

The
      DCAA
      issued various audit reports related to task orders under the RIO contract
      that
      reported $275 million in questioned and unsupported costs. The majority of
      these
      costs were associated with the humanitarian fuel mission. In these reports,
      the
      DCAA compared fuel costs we incurred during the duration of the RIO contract
      in
      2003 and early 2004 to fuel prices obtained by the Defense Energy Supply Center
      (DESC) in April 2004 when the fuel mission was transferred to that agency.
      During the fourth quarter of 2005, we resolved all outstanding issues related
      to
      the RIO contract with our customer and settled the remaining questioned costs
      under this contract.

Laundry.

Prior to
      the fourth quarter of 2005, we received notice from the DCAA that it recommended
      withholding $18 million of subcontract costs related to the laundry service
      for
      one task order in southern Iraq for which it believes we and our subcontractors
      have not provided adequate levels of documentation supporting the quantity
      of
      the services provided. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the DCAA issued a notice
      to disallow costs totaling approximately $12 million, releasing $6 million
      of
      amounts previously withheld. The $12 million has been withheld from the
      subcontractor. We are working with the DCMA and the subcontractor to resolve
      this issue.

Containers.

In June
      2005, the DCAA recommended withholding certain costs associated with providing
      containerized housing for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel in Iraq.
      Approximately $55 million has been withheld as of December 31, 2005 (down from
      $60 million originally reported because some issues have been resolved). The
      DCAA recommended that the costs be withheld pending receipt of additional
      explanation or documentation to support the subcontract costs. We have provided
      information we believe addresses the concerns raised by the DCAA. None of these
      amounts have been withheld from our subcontractors. We are working with the
      government and our subcontractors to resolve this issue.

Other
      issues.

The DCAA
      is continuously performing audits of costs incurred for the foregoing and other
      services provided by us under our government contracts. During these audits,
      there are likely to be questions raised by the DCAA about the reasonableness
      or
      allowability of certain costs or the quality or quantity of supporting
      documentation. No assurance can be given that the DCAA might not recommend
      withholding some portion of the questioned costs while the issues are being
      resolved with our customer. Because of the intense scrutiny involving our
      government contracts operations, issues raised by the DCAA may be more difficult
      to resolve. We do not believe any potential withholding will have a significant
      or sustained impact on our liquidity.

Investigations

In
      early
      2004, our internal audit function identified a potential $4 million overbilling
      by La Nouvelle Trading & Contracting Company, W.L.L. (La Nouvelle), one of
      our subcontractors under the LogCAP contract in Iraq, for services performed
      during 2003. In accordance with our policy and government regulation, the
      potential overcharge was reported to the Department of Defense Inspector
      General’s office as well as to our customer, the AMC. We reimbursed the AMC to
      cover that potential overbilling while we conducted our own investigation into
      the matter. We subsequently terminated La Nouvelle’s services under the LogCAP
      contract. In October 2004, La Nouvelle filed suit against us alleging $224
      million in damages as a result of its termination. During the second quarter
      of
      2005, this suit was settled without material impact to us. See Note 12 for
      further discussion.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2005, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) issued
      two
      indictments associated with these issues against a former KBR procurement
      manager and a manager of La Nouvelle.

In
      October 2004, we reported to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s
      office that two former employees in Kuwait may have had inappropriate contacts
      with individuals employed by or affiliated with two third-party subcontractors
      prior to the award of the subcontracts. The Inspector General’s office may
      investigate whether these two employees may have solicited and/or accepted
      payments from these third-party subcontractors while they were employed by
      us.


In
      October 2004, a civilian contracting official in the COE asked for a review
      of
      the process used by the COE for awarding some of the contracts to us. We
      understand that the Department of Defense Inspector General’s office may review
      the issues involved.

We
      understand that the DOJ, an Assistant United States Attorney based in Illinois,
      and others are investigating these and other individually immaterial matters
      we
      have reported relating to our government contract work in Iraq. If criminal
      wrongdoing were found, criminal penalties could range up to the greater of
      $500,000 in fines per count for a corporation or twice the gross pecuniary
      gain
      or loss. We also understand that current and former employees of KBR have
      received subpoenas and have given or may give grand jury testimony related
      to
      some of these matters.

Withholding
      of payments

During
      2004, the AMC issued a determination that a particular contract clause could
      cause it to withhold 15% from our invoices until our task orders under the
      LogCAP contract are definitized. The AMC delayed implementation of this
      withholding pending further review. During the third quarter of 2004, we and
      the
      AMC identified three senior management teams to facilitate negotiation under
      the
      LogCAP task orders, and these teams concluded their effort by successfully
      negotiating the final outstanding task order definitization on March 31, 2005.
      This made us current with regard to definitization of historical LogCAP task
      orders and eliminated the potential 15% withholding issue under the LogCAP
      contract.

Upon
      the
      completion of the RIO contract definitization process, the COE released all
      previously withheld amounts related to this contract in the fourth quarter
      of
      2005.

The
      PCO
      Oil South project has definitized substantially all of the task orders, and
      we
      have collected a significant portion of the amounts previously withheld. We
      do
      not believe the withholding will have a significant or sustained impact on
      our
      liquidity because the withholding is temporary, and the definitization process
      is substantially complete.

We
      are
      working diligently with our customers to proceed with significant new work
      only
      after we have a fully definitized task order, which should limit withholdings
      on
      future task orders for all government contracts.

In
      addition, we had probable unapproved claims totaling $69 million at December
      31,
      2005 for the LogCAP and PCO Oil South contracts. These unapproved claims related
      to contracts where our costs have exceeded the customer’s funded value of the
      task order.

DCMA
      system reviews

Report
      on estimating system.

On
      December 27, 2004, the DCMA granted continued approval of our estimating system,
      stating that our estimating system is “acceptable with corrective action.” We
      are in the process of completing these corrective actions. Specifically, based
      on the unprecedented level of support that our employees are providing the
      military in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we needed to update our estimating
      policies and procedures to make them better suited to such contingency
      situations. Additionally, we have completed our development of a detailed
      training program and have made it available to all estimating personnel to
      ensure that employees are adequately prepared to deal with the challenges and
      unique circumstances associated with a contingency operation.

Report
      on purchasing system.

As a
      result of a Contractor Purchasing System Review by the DCMA during the fourth
      quarter of 2005, the DCMA granted the continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system. The DCMA’s approval letter, dated October 28, 2005,
      stated that our purchasing system’s policies and practices are “effective and
      efficient, and provide adequate protection of the Government’s
      interest.”

Report
      on accounting system.

We
      received two draft reports on our accounting system, which raised various issues
      and questions. We have responded to the points raised by the DCAA, but this
      review remains open. Once the DCAA finalizes the report, it will be submitted
      to
      the DCMA, who will make a determination of the adequacy of our accounting
      systems for government contracting.


The
      Balkans

We
      have
      had inquiries in the past by the DCAA and the civil fraud division of the DOJ
      into possible overcharges for work performed during 1996 through 2000 under
      a
      contract in the Balkans, for which inquiry has not yet been completed by the
      DOJ. Based on an internal investigation, we credited our customer approximately
      $2 million during 2000 and 2001 related to our work in the Balkans as a result
      of billings for which support was not readily available. We believe that the
      preliminary DOJ inquiry relates to potential overcharges in connection with
      a
      part of the Balkans contract under which approximately $100 million in work
      was
      done. We believe that any allegations of overcharges would be without merit.
      Amounts accrued related to this matter as of December 31, 2005 are not
      material.

Note
      12. Other Commitments and Contingencies

Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into payments made in connection with
      the
      construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a multibillion dollar natural
      gas liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
      Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related criminal investigation. The
      government has also issued a subpoena to Halliburton seeking information, which
      we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection with
      multiple projects or services over the past 20 years located both in and outside
      of Nigeria in which The M .W. Kellogg Company, M. W. Kellogg, Ltd., Kellogg
      Brown & Root or their joint ventures, as well as the Halliburton energy
      services business, were participants. M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. is a joint venture
      in
      which Kellogg Brown & Root has a 55% interest. The M. W. Kellogg Company was
      a subsidiary of Dresser Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser
      Industries and was later merged with a subsidiary of ours to form Kellogg Brown
      & Root.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). We have been cooperating
      with the SEC and the DOJ, as well as with investigations into the Bonny Island
      project in France and Nigeria. Our Board of Directors has appointed a committee
      of independent directors to oversee and direct the FCPA
      investigations.

The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries (which included M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. and The M .W. Kellogg
      Company)) and include TSKJ’s use of a Japanese trading company that contracted
      to provide services to TSKJ. We have produced documents to the SEC and the
      DOJ
      both voluntarily and pursuant to subpoenas, and we are making our employees
      available to the SEC and the DOJ for interviews. In addition, we understand
      that
      the SEC has issued a subpoena to A. Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a
      consultant and chairman of KBR, and to others, including certain current and
      former KBR employees and at least one subcontractor of KBR. We further
      understand that the DOJ has invoked its authority under a sitting grand jury
      to
      issue subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we
      understand that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ
      and
      the SEC with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
      subpoenas.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (an affiliate of ENI
      SpA
      of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (as successor
      to The M. W. Kellogg Company), each of which owns 25% of the venture. TSKJ
      and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA).
      Commencing in 1995, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements in
      connection with the Bonny Island project, including with Tri-Star Investments,
      of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal. We understand that a French magistrate
      has officially placed Mr. Tesler under investigation for corruption of a foreign
      public official. In Nigeria, a legislative committee of the National Assembly
      and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is organized as part
      of
      the executive branch of the government, are also investigating these matters.
      Our representatives have met with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials.
      In October 2004, representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the
      Nigerian legislative committee.


As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe, based on the ongoing governmental and
      other investigations, that payments may have been made to Nigerian
      officials.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements.

In
      June
      2004, we terminated all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant
      and former employee of M. W. Kellogg, Ltd. The terminations occurred because
      of
      violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved the receipt
      of improper personal benefits in connection with TSKJ’s construction of the
      natural gas liquefaction facility in Nigeria.

Until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding compliance with
      applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct, we have also suspended the
      services of another agent who has worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several
      current projects and on numerous older projects going back to the early 1980’s.
      In addition, we are actively reviewing the compliance of an additional agent
      on
      a separate current Nigerian project with respect to which we have recently
      received from a joint venture partner on that project allegations of wrongful
      payments made by such agent.

In
      February 2005, TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would
      not
      oppose the Attorney General’s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in
      banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria and to have the legal ownership
      of
      such sums determined in the Nigerian courts.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement, and injunctive relief. Criminal penalties
      could range up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss.

Both
      the
      SEC and the DOJ could argue that continuing conduct may constitute multiple
      violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts per
      violation.

Often,
      agreed dispositions for these types of matters result in a monitor being
      appointed by the SEC and/or the DOJ to review future business and practices
      with
      the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA. Fines and civil and criminal
      penalties could be mitigated, in the government’s discretion, depending on the
      level of the cooperation in the investigations.

Potential
      consequences of a criminal indictment arising out of these matters could include
      suspension by the Department of Defense or another federal, state, or local
      government agency of KBR and its affiliates from their ability to contract
      with
      United States, state or local governments, or government agencies and, if a
      criminal or civil violation were found, KBR and its affiliates could be debarred
      from future contracts or new orders under current contracts to provide services
      to any such parties. During 2005, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $6.6 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. Consistent with our cooperation
      with the DOJ and the SEC, we would seek to obtain administrative agreements
      or
      waivers to avoid suspension or debarment. Generally, debarments can last up
      to
      three years. Suspension or debarment from the government contracts business
      would have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations
      of KBR and Halliburton.

There
      can
      be no assurance that any governmental investigation or our investigation of
      these matters will not conclude that violations of applicable laws have
      occurred. The results of these investigations could have a material adverse
      effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition,
      and cash flows.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we have not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments made in connection with the
      Nigerian project, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and
      other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one or
      more
      competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such coordination
      possibly began as early as the mid-1980s, which was significantly before our
      1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries.


On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Suspension or debarment from contracting
      with the United States, state or local governments, or government agencies
      could
      also occur. Criminal prosecutions under applicable laws of relevant foreign
      jurisdictions and civil claims by or relationship issues with customers are
      also
      possible.

There
      can
      be no assurance that the results of these investigations will not have a
      material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts related to this investigation
      other than our current legal expenses.

SEC
      investigation of change in accounting for revenue on long-term construction
      projects and related disclosures

In
      August
      2004, we reached a settlement in the investigation by the SEC involving our
      and 1999 disclosure of an accounting for the recognition of revenue from
      unapproved claims on long-term construction projects. Our settlement with the
      SEC covers a failure to disclose a 1998 change in accounting practice. We
      disclosed the change in accounting practice in our 1999 Annual Report on Form
      10-K and continued to do so in subsequent periods. The SEC did not determine
      that we departed from generally accepted accounting principles nor did it find
      errors in accounting or fraud. We neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings
      but paid a $7.5 million civil penalty and recorded a charge of that amount
      in
      the second quarter of 2004. As part of the settlement, the Company agreed to
      cease and desist from committing or causing future securities law violations.

Securities
      and related litigation

On
      June
      3, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against us in federal court on behalf
      of purchasers of our common stock during the period of approximately May 1998
      until approximately May 2002 alleging violations of the federal securities
      laws
      in connection with the accounting change and disclosures involved in the SEC
      investigation discussed above. In addition, the plaintiffs allege that we
      overstated our revenue from unapproved claims by recognizing amounts not
      reasonably estimable or probable of collection. In the weeks that followed,
      approximately twenty similar class actions were filed against us. Several of
      those lawsuits also named as defendants Arthur Andersen LLP, our independent
      accountants for the period covered by the lawsuits, and several of our present
      or former officers and directors. The class action cases were later
      consolidated, and the amended consolidated class action complaint, styled

Richard
      Moore, et al. v. Halliburton Company, et al.,

was
      filed and served upon us on or about April 11, 2003 (the “

Moore

class
      action”). In October 2002 and March 2003, two derivative actions arising out of
      essentially the same facts and circumstances were filed. Both of those actions
      have now been dismissed.

In
      early
      May 2003, we announced that we had entered into a written memorandum of
      understanding setting forth the terms upon which the

Moore

class
      action would be settled. In June 2003, the lead plaintiffs in the

Moore

class
      action filed a motion for leave to file a second amended consolidated complaint,
      which was granted by the court. In addition to restating the original accounting
      and disclosure claims, the second amended consolidated complaint includes claims
      arising out of the 1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries, Inc. by Halliburton,
      including that we failed to timely disclose the resulting asbestos liability
      exposure (the “Dresser claims”). The Dresser claims were included in the
      settlement discussions leading up to the signing of the memorandum of
      understanding and were among the claims the parties intended to have resolved
      by
      the terms of the proposed settlement of the consolidated

Moore

class
      action and the derivative action. The memorandum of understanding called for
      Halliburton to pay $6 million, which would be funded by insurance
      proceeds.


On
      June
      7, 2004, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement.
      Following the transfer of the case to another district judge and a final hearing
      on the fairness of the settlement, on September 9, 2004, the court entered
      an
      order holding that evidence of the settlement’s fairness was inadequate, denying
      the motion for final approval of the settlement in the

Moore

class
      action, and ordering the parties, among other things, to mediate. After the
      court’s denial of the motion to approve the settlement, we withdrew from the
      settlement as we believe we are entitled to do by its terms. The mediation
      was
      held on January 27, 2005 and, at the conclusion of that day, was declared by
      the
      mediator to be at an impasse with no settlement having been
      reached.

After
      the
      mediation, the lead plaintiff and lead counsel filed motions to withdraw as
      lead
      plaintiff and lead counsel. The court conducted a hearing on those motions
      on
      April 29, 2005. At that hearing, the court granted the motions, appointed new
      co-lead counsel and a new lead plaintiff, directed that they file a third
      consolidated amended complaint not later than May 9, 2005, and that we file
      our
      motion to dismiss not later than June 8, 2005. That motion has now been filed
      and fully briefed. The court held oral arguments on that motion on August 2,
      2005, at which time the court took the motion under advisement. We await the
      court’s ruling. Should the motion to dismiss be denied, we intend to vigorously
      defend the action.

Newmont
      Gold

In
      July
      1998, Newmont Gold, a gold mining and extraction company, filed a lawsuit over
      the failure of a blower manufactured and supplied to Newmont by Roots, a former
      division of Dresser Equipment Group. The plaintiff alleges that during the
      manufacturing process, Roots had reversed the blades of a component of the
      blower known as the inlet guide vane assembly, resulting in the blower’s failure
      and the shutdown of the gold extraction mill for a period of approximately
      one
      month during 1996. In January 2002, a Nevada trial court granted summary
      judgment to Roots on all counts, and Newmont appealed. In February 2004, the
      Nevada Supreme Court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case to
      the
      trial court, holding that fact issues existed requiring a trial. Based on
      pretrial reports, the damages claimed by the plaintiff are in the range of
      $33
      million to $39 million. We believe that we have valid defenses to Newmont Gold’s
      claims and intend to vigorously defend the matter. The case was scheduled for
      trial beginning the last full week of May 2005. At the conclusion of jury
      selection, we again requested a motion for change of venue we had filed earlier.
      That motion was denied by the trial court, and the Nevada Supreme Court
      affirmed. Our present intention is to request that the three judge panel that
      decided the appeal reconsider its ruling, failing which we may request that
      the
      entire Nevada Supreme Court rehear the appeal. Should those efforts be
      unsuccessful, the case will be returned to the trial court where a new trial
      setting will be ordered and the case will proceed to trial. As of December
      31,
      2005, we had not accrued any amounts related to this matter.

Smith
      International award

In
      June
      2004, a Texas district court jury returned a verdict in our favor in connection
      with a patent infringement lawsuit we filed against Smith International (Smith).
      We were awarded $24 million in damages by the jury. We filed the lawsuit in
      September 2002, seeking damages for Smith’s infringement of our patented Energy
      Balanced™ roller cone drill bit technology. The jury found that Smith’s
      competing bits willfully infringed on three of our patents. During the fourth
      quarter of 2005, this case was settled along with cases dealing with the same
      and related technology and pending in Tyler and Houston, Texas, the United
      Kingdom, and Italy.

Improper
      payments reported to the SEC

During
      the second quarter of 2002, we reported to the SEC that one of our foreign
      subsidiaries operating in Nigeria made improper payments of approximately $2.4
      million to entities owned by a Nigerian national who held himself out as a
      tax
      consultant, when in fact he was an employee of a local tax authority. The
      payments were made to obtain favorable tax treatment and clearly violated our
      Code of Business Conduct and our internal control procedures. The payments
      were
      discovered during our audit of the foreign subsidiary. We conducted an
      investigation assisted by outside legal counsel, and, based on the findings
      of
      the investigation, we terminated several employees. None of our senior officers
      were involved. We are cooperating with the SEC in its review of the matter.
      We
      took further action to ensure that our foreign subsidiary paid all taxes owed
      in
      Nigeria. A preliminary assessment of approximately $4 million was issued by
      the
      Nigerian tax authorities in the second quarter of 2003. We are cooperating
      with
      the Nigerian tax authorities to determine the total amount due as quickly as
      possible.


Operations
      in Iran

We
      received and responded to an inquiry in mid-2001 from the Office of Foreign
      Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Treasury Department with respect
      to
      operations in Iran by a Halliburton subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman
      Islands. The OFAC inquiry requested information with respect to compliance
      with
      the Iranian Transaction Regulations. These regulations prohibit United States
      citizens, including United States corporations and other United States business
      organizations, from engaging in commercial, financial, or trade transactions
      with Iran, unless authorized by OFAC or exempted by statute. Our 2001 written
      response to OFAC stated that we believed that we were in compliance with
      applicable sanction regulations. In January 2004, we received a follow-up letter
      from OFAC requesting additional information. We responded to this request on
      March 19, 2004. We understand this matter has now been referred by OFAC to
      the
      DOJ. In July 2004, we received a grand jury subpoena from an Assistant United
      States District Attorney requesting the production of documents. We are
      cooperating with the government’s investigation and have responded to the
      subpoena by producing documents on September 16, 2004. As of December 31, 2005,
      we had not accrued any amounts related to this investigation.

Separate
      from the OFAC inquiry, we completed a study in 2003 of our activities in Iran
      during 2002 and 2003 and concluded that these activities were in compliance
      with
      applicable sanction regulations. These sanction regulations require isolation
      of
      entities that conduct activities in Iran from contact with United States
      citizens or managers of United States companies. Notwithstanding our conclusions
      that our activities in Iran were not in violation of United States laws and
      regulations, we announced that, after fulfilling our current contractual
      obligations within Iran, we intend to cease operations within that country
      and
      to withdraw from further activities there.

Litigation
      brought by La Nouvelle

In
      October 2004, La Nouvelle, a subcontractor to us in connection with our
      government services work in Kuwait and Iraq, filed suit alleging breach of
      contract and interference with contractual and business relations. The relief
      sought included $224 million in damages for breach of contract, which included
      $34 million for wrongful interference and an unspecified sum for consequential
      and punitive damages. The dispute arose from our termination of a master
      agreement pursuant to which La Nouvelle operated a number of DFACs in Kuwait
      and
      Iraq and the replacement of La Nouvelle with ESS, which, prior to La Nouvelle’s
      termination, had served as La Nouvelle’s subcontractor. In addition, La Nouvelle
      alleged that we wrongfully withheld from La Nouvelle certain sums due La
      Nouvelle under its various subcontracts. During the second quarter of 2005,
      this
      litigation was settled without material impact to us.

David
      Hudak and International Hydrocut Technologies Corp.

On
      October 12, 2004, David Hudak and International Hydrocut Technologies Corp.
      (collectively, Hudak) filed suit against us in the United States District Court
      alleging civil Racketeer Influenced and Corporate Organizations Act violations,
      fraud, breach of contract, unfair trade practices, and other torts. The action,
      which seeks unspecified damages, arises out of Hudak’s alleged purchase in early
      1994 of certain explosive charges that were later alleged by the DOJ to be
      military ordnance, the possession of which by persons not possessing the
      requisite licenses and registrations is unlawful. As a result of that allegation
      by the government, Hudak was charged with, but later acquitted of, certain
      criminal offenses in connection with his possession of the explosive charges.
      As
      mentioned above, the alleged transaction(s) took place more than 10 years ago.
      The fact that most of the individuals that may have been involved, as well
      as
      the entities themselves, are no longer affiliated with us will complicate our
      investigation. For those reasons and because the litigation is in its most
      preliminary stages, it is premature to assess the likelihood of an adverse
      result. We have filed a motion to dismiss and, alternatively, a motion to
      transfer venue and are awaiting the court’s decision on those motions. It is,
      however, our intention to vigorously defend this action. As of December 31,
      2005, we had not accrued any amounts related to this matter.


Convoy
      ambush litigation

Several
      of the families of truck drivers, employed by KBR and killed when a fuel convoy
      was ambushed in Iraq on April 9, 2004, have filed suit against us. These suits
      allege that we are responsible for the deaths of these drivers for a variety
      of
      reasons and assert legal claims for fraud, wrongful death, civil rights
      violations, and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
      Act. We deny the allegations of wrongdoing and fully intend to vigorously defend
      the actions. We believe that our conduct was entirely lawful and that our
      liability is limited by federal law. On July 1, 2005, the federal court in
      Houston, Texas denied our motion to dismiss based upon a narrow exception to
      the
      Defense Base Act. As of December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts
      related to these matters.

Iraq
      overtime litigation

During
      the fourth quarter of 2005, a group of present and former employees working
      on
      the LogCAP contract in Iraq and elsewhere filed a class action lawsuit alleging
      that KBR wrongfully failed to pay time and a half for hours worked in excess
      of
      40 per work week and that “uplift” pay, consisting of a foreign service bonus,
      an area differential, and danger pay, was only applied to the first 40 hours
      worked in any work week. The class alleged by plaintiffs consists of all current
      and former employees on the LogCAP contract from December 2001 to present.
      The
      basis of plaintiffs’ claims is their assertion that they are intended
      third-party beneficiaries of the LogCAP contract, and that the LogCAP contract
      obligated KBR to pay time and a half for all overtime hours. We have moved
      to
      dismiss the case on a number of bases, and that motion remains pending at this
      time. In the event the motion to dismiss is denied, we intend to vigorously
      defend this case. It is premature to assess the probability of an adverse result
      in this action. However, because the LogCAP contract is cost-reimbursable,
      we
      could charge any overtime and “uplift” pay to the customer in the event of an
      adverse judgment. As of December 31, 2005, we had not accrued any amounts
      related to this matter.

Environmental

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.

In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations. Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were $50 million
      as of December 31, 2005 and $41 million as of December 31, 2004. The liability
      covers numerous properties, and no individual property accounts for more than
      $10 million of the liability balance. We have subsidiaries that have been named
      as potentially responsible parties along with other third parties for 14 federal
      and state superfund sites for which we have established a liability. As of
      December 31, 2005, those 14 sites accounted for approximately $13 million of
      our
      total $50 million liability. In some instances, we have been named a potentially
      responsible party by a regulatory agency, but in each of those cases, we do
      not
      believe we have any material liability.


Letters
      of credit

In
      the
      normal course of business, we have agreements with banks under which
      approximately $1.2 billion of letters of credit or bank guarantees were
      outstanding as of December 31, 2005, including $434 million that relate to
      our
      joint ventures’ operations. Also included in letters of credit outstanding as of
      December 31, 2005 were $183 million of performance letters of credit and $114
      million of retainage letters of credit related to the Barracuda-Caratinga
      project. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that
      would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization.

Other
      commitments

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had commitments to fund approximately $79 million to
      related companies. These commitments arose primarily during the start-up of
      these entities or due to losses incurred by them. We expect approximately $61
      million of the commitments to be paid during 2006.

Liquidated
      damages

Many
      of
      our engineering and construction contracts have milestone due dates that must
      be
      met or we may be subject to penalties for liquidated damages if claims are
      asserted and we were responsible for the delays. These generally relate to
      specified activities within a project by a set contractual date or achievement
      of a specified level of output or throughput of a plant we construct. Each
      contract defines the conditions under which a customer may make a claim for
      liquidated damages. However, in most instances, liquidated damages are not
      asserted by the customer, but the potential to do so is used in negotiating
      claims and closing out the contract. We had not accrued for liquidated damages
      of $70 million at December 31, 2005 and $44 million at December 31, 2004
      (including amounts related to our share of unconsolidated subsidiaries) that
      we
      could incur based upon completing the projects as forecasted.

Leases

We
      are
      obligated under operating leases, principally for the use of land, offices,
      equipment, field facilities, and warehouses. Total rentals, net of sublease
      rentals, were as follows:

The
      reconciliations between the actual provision for income taxes on continuing
      operations and that computed by applying the United States statutory rate to
      income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interest, and
      change in accounting principle were as follows:

The
      major
      component of the difference between the 2005 statutory tax rate compared to
      the
      effective tax rate is the release of a valuation allowance established in prior
      years.

We
      generally do not provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
      non-United States subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be
      reinvested indefinitely to finance foreign activities. Taxes are provided as
      necessary with respect to earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The
      American Job Creations Act of 2004 introduced a special dividends received
      deduction with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
      United States taxpayer under certain circumstances. Based on our analysis of
      the
      Act, we decided not to utilize the special deduction.

The
      primary components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related
      valuation allowances, including deferred tax accounts associated with
      discontinued operations, were as follows:

We
      have
      $186 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that expire from 2006
      through 2015 and additional foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $124
      million with indefinite expiration dates. During 2005, our existing deferred
      tax
      asset related to asbestos and silica liabilities became a United States net
      operating loss, due to the tax deduction of the related costs in 2005. As a
      result, a domestic net operating loss carryforward of $2.1 billion was created,
      which expires in 2025. The federal alternative minimum tax credits are available
      to reduce future United States federal income taxes on an indefinite
      basis.

We
      have
      established a valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers and
      certain foreign operating loss carryforwards on the basis that we believe these
      assets will not be utilized in the statutory carryover period. We continue
      to
      carry a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset related to asbestos
      and silica liabilities, which are now included in our United States net
      operating loss, although the amount of the valuation allowance was significantly
      reduced during 2005. The valuation allowance represents the anticipated impact
      of the United States net operating loss on our ability to utilize future foreign
      tax credits. We anticipate that the United States net operating loss will
      displace future foreign tax credits, and those credits will expire unutilized.
      Our 2005 tax rate is lower because we recorded favorable adjustments to our
      valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset related to asbestos and
      silica liabilities in 2005 totaling $805 million. Our strong 2005 earnings,
      coupled with an upward revision in our estimate of future domestic taxable
      income in 2006 and beyond, drove these adjustments.

In
      February 2006, the Board of Directors approved a 2:1 stock split, subject to
      shareholder approval at the 2006 annual shareholders meeting of a proposal
      to
      increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from one billion shares
      to two billion shares. Each shareholder would receive one additional share
      for
      each outstanding share held by the shareholder on the record date for the stock
      split. The record date will be announced after the approval of the increase
      in
      authorized shares of common stock.

Our
      Stock and Incentive Plan provides for the grant of any or all of the following
      types of awards:

-

stock
                options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
                options;

-

Under
      the
      terms of the 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended, 49 million shares of
      common stock have been reserved for issuance to key employees. The plan
      specifies that no more than 16 million shares can be awarded as restricted
      stock. At December 31, 2005, 12 million shares were available for future grants
      under the 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan, of which seven million shares remained
      available for restricted stock awards.

All
      stock
      options under the 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan are granted at the fair market
      value of the common stock at the grant date. No further stock option grants
      are
      being made under the stock plans of acquired companies.

The

Options

There
      were 14.1 million options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price
      of
      $34.15 at December 31, 2004 and 13.8 million options exercisable with a weighted
      average exercise price of $34.59 at December 31, 2003.

Stock
      options generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Stock options under
      the
      1993 Stock and Incentive Plan vest ratably over a three- or four-year period.
      Options under the non-employee directors’ plan vest after six
      months.

Restricted
      shares awarded under the 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan were 1,141,325 in 2005,
      1,177,312 in 2004, and 431,865 in 2003. The shares awarded are net of
      forfeitures of 260,240 in 2005, 143,908 in 2004, and 248,620 in 2003. The
      weighted average fair market value per share at the date of grant of shares
      granted was $47.60 in 2005, $29.80 in 2004, and $22.94 in 2003.

Our
      Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors allows for each non-employee
      director to receive an annual award of 400 restricted shares of common stock
      as
      a part of compensation. We reserved 100,000 shares of common stock for issuance
      to non-employee directors. Under this plan we issued 3,200 restricted shares
      in
      2005 and 4,000 restricted shares in both 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005,
      49,200 shares have been issued to non-employee directors under this plan. The
      weighted average fair market value per share at the date of grant of shares
      granted was $56.73 in 2005, $31.30 in 2004, and $22.24 in 2003.


Our
      Employees’ Restricted Stock Plan was established for employees who are not
      officers, for which 200,000 shares of common stock have been reserved. At
      December 31, 2005, 151,850 shares (net of 43,550 shares forfeited) have been
      issued. There were no forfeitures in 2005 or 2004. Forfeitures were 800 in
      2003.
      No further grants are being made under this plan.

Under
      the
      terms of our Career Executive Incentive Stock Plan, 15 million shares of our
      common stock were reserved for issuance to officers and key employees at a
      purchase price not to exceed par value of $2.50 per share. At December 31,
      2005,
      11.7 million shares (net of 2.2 million shares forfeited) have been issued
      under
      the plan. The last grant made under this plan was in December 1992. No further
      grants will be made under the Career Executive Incentive Stock
      Plan.

Restricted
      shares issued under the 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan, Restricted Stock Plan
      for
      Non-Employee Directors, Employees’ Restricted Stock Plan, and the Career
      Executive Incentive Stock Plan are limited as to sale or disposition. These
      restrictions lapse periodically over an extended period of time not exceeding
      years. Restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions
      in
      accordance with our established policies. Upon termination of employment, shares
      in which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in
      restricted stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock on the date
      of
      issuance is being amortized and charged to income over the period during which
      the restrictions lapse, with similar credits to paid-in capital in excess of
      par
      value. At December 31, 2005, the unamortized amount is $98 million. We
      recognized compensation costs of $31 million in 2005, $21 million in 2004,
      and
      $20 million in 2003.

During
      2002, our Board of Directors approved the 2002 ESPP and reserved 12 million
      shares for issuance. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may have up to 10%
      of
      their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase
      shares of common stock. Unless the Board of Directors shall determine otherwise,
      each six-month offering period commences on January 1 and July 1 of each year.
      The price at which common stock may be purchased under the ESPP is equal to
      85%
      of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement
      date or last trading day of each offering period. Through the ESPP, there were
      approximately 1.3 million shares sold in 2005, approximately 1.7 million shares
      sold in 2004, and approximately 1.3 million shares sold in 2003.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up
      to
      $1.0 billion, which replaces our previous share repurchase program. The stock
      repurchase program does not require a specific number of shares to be purchased
      and the program may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions
      in
      the market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program may be
      terminated or suspended at any time.

Note
      15. Preferred Stock

Our
      preferred stock consists of five million total authorized shares at December
      31,
      2005. We previously declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right
      on
      each outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was also applicable to
      each
      share of our common stock that was issued subsequent to adoption of the Rights
      Agreement entered into with Mellon Investor Services LLC. Each preferred stock
      purchase right entitled its holder to buy one two-hundredth of a share of our
      Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, at an exercise
      price of $75. These preferred stock purchase rights were subject to antidilution
      adjustments, which were described in the Rights Agreement entered into with
      Mellon. The preferred stock purchase rights did not have any voting rights
      and
      were not entitled to dividends. The preferred stock purchase rights expired
      on
      December 15, 2005 with the expiration of the Rights Agreement. On December
      19,
      2005, we filed a Certificate of Elimination, which eliminated all rights and
      preferences related to shares of our preferred stock.

Note
      16. Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic
      income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding during the period and, effective January 1, 2005, includes the
      59.5
      million shares that were contributed to the trusts established for the benefit
      of asbestos claimants. Diluted income (loss) per share includes additional
      common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with
      a
      dilutive effect had been issued. A reconciliation of the number of shares used
      for the basic and diluted income (loss) per share calculation is as
      follows:


Millions
                of shares




Basic
                weighted average common shares outstanding




Dilutive
                effect of:

Stock
                options




Convertible
                senior notes premium


-

-

Restricted
                stock



-

Other

-



Diluted
                weighted average common shares outstanding




In
      December 2004, we entered into a supplemental indenture that requires us to
      satisfy our conversion obligation for our convertible senior notes in cash,
      rather than in common stock, for at least the aggregate principal amount of
      the
      notes. This reduced the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include
      the conversion premium, which is the difference between the conversion price
      per
      share of common stock and the average share price. See the table above for
      the
      dilutive effect for 2005. The conversion price of $37.65 per share of common
      stock was greater than our average share price in 2004 and 2003 and,
      consequently, did not result in dilution.

Excluded
      from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share were options to purchase
      one million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2005, nine million
      shares of common stock outstanding in 2004, and 15 million shares of common
      stock outstanding in 2003. These options were outstanding during these years
      but
      were excluded because the option exercise price was greater than the average
      market price of the common shares.

Note
      17. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Foreign
      exchange risk

Techniques
      in managing foreign exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign
      currency borrowing and investing and the use of currency derivative instruments.
      We selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign exchange losses
      considering current market conditions, future operating activities, and the
      associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. The purpose of our
      foreign currency risk management activities is to protect us from the risk
      that
      the eventual dollar cash flows resulting from the sale and purchase of services
      and products in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in
      exchange rates.

We
      manage
      our currency exposure through the use of currency derivative instruments as
      it
      relates to the major currencies, which are generally the currencies of the
      countries in which we do the majority of our international business. These
      contracts generally have an expiration date of two years or less. Forward
      exchange contracts, which are commitments to buy or sell a specified amount
      of a
      foreign currency at a specified price and time, are generally used to manage
      identifiable foreign currency commitments. Forward exchange contracts and
      foreign exchange option contracts, which convey the right, but not the
      obligation, to sell or buy a specified amount of foreign currency at a specified
      price, are generally used to manage exposures related to assets and liabilities
      denominated in a foreign currency. None of the forward or option contracts
      are
      exchange traded. While derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in
      value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying
      exposures being managed. The use of some contracts may limit our ability to
      benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign
      currency contracts are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies
      due
      primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded
      currencies). We attempt to manage our working capital position to minimize
      foreign currency commitments in non-traded currencies and recognize that pricing
      for the services and products offered in these countries should cover the cost
      of exchange rate devaluations. We have historically incurred transaction losses
      in non-traded currencies.


Assets,
      liabilities, and forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign
      currencies.

We
      utilize the derivative instruments described above to manage the foreign
      currency exposures related to specific assets and liabilities that are
      denominated in foreign currencies; however, we have not elected to account
      for
      these instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Additionally, we utilize
      the derivative instruments described above to manage forecasted cash flows
      denominated in foreign currencies generally related to long-term engineering
      and
      construction projects. Beginning in 2003, we designated these contracts related
      to engineering and construction projects as cash flow hedges. The ineffective
      portion of these hedges was included in operating income in the accompanying
      consolidated statement of operations and was not material in 2005, 2004, or
      2003. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $18 million in unrealized
      net losses on these cash flow hedges and, as of December 31, 2004, we had
      approximately $23 million in unrealized net gains on these cash flow hedges
      and
      $10 million as of December 31, 2003. We included these unrealized gains and
      losses on these cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income in the
      accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We expect approximately $10 million
      of
      the unrealized net losses on these cash flow hedges to be reclassified into
      earnings within a year. Changes in the timing or amount of the future cash
      flows
      being hedged could result in hedges becoming ineffective, and, as a result,
      the
      amount of unrealized gain or loss associated with those hedges would be
      reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings. At December 31,
      2005, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to
      the
      variability in future cash flows associated with foreign currency forecasted
      transactions is 45 months. The fair value of these contracts was immaterial
      as
      of December 31, 2005, $27 million as of December 31, 2004, and immaterial as
      of
      December 31, 2003.

Notional
      amounts and fair market values.

The
      notional amounts of open forward contracts and option contracts were $666
      million at December 31, 2005 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2004. The notional
      amounts of our foreign exchange contracts do not generally represent amounts
      exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure or of
      the
      cash requirements related to these contracts. The amounts exchanged are
      calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the
      derivatives, such as exchange rates.

Credit
      risk

Financial
      instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are
      primarily cash equivalents, investments, and trade receivables. It is our
      practice to place our cash equivalents and investments in high quality
      securities with various investment institutions. We derive the majority of
      our
      revenue from our United States government contracts, primarily for projects
      in
      the Middle East, and from sales and services, including engineering and
      construction, to the energy industry. Within the energy industry, trade
      receivables are generated from a broad and diverse group of customers. There
      are
      concentrations of receivables in the United States and the United Kingdom.
      We
      maintain an allowance for losses based upon the expected collectibility of
      all
      trade accounts receivable. In addition, see Note 5 for discussion of United
      States government receivables.

There
      are
      no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty
      related to our derivative contracts. We select counterparties based on their
      profitability, balance sheet, and a capacity for timely payment of financial
      commitments, which is unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
      events.

Interest
      rate risk

We
      have
      several debt instruments outstanding that have both fixed and variable interest
      rates. We manage our ratio of fixed-rate to variable-rate debt through the
      use
      of different types of debt instruments and derivative instruments. As of
      December 31, 2005, we held no material interest rate derivative
      instruments.

Fair
      market value of financial instruments.

The
      estimated fair market value of long-term debt was $2.9 billion at December
      31,
      2005 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2004, as compared to the carrying amount
      of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2004.
      The
      fair market value of fixed-rate long-term debt is based on quoted market prices
      for those or similar instruments. The carrying amount of variable-rate long-term
      debt approximates fair market value because these instruments reflect market
      changes to interest rates. The carrying amount of short-term financial
      instruments, cash and equivalents, receivables, short-term notes payable, and
      accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates
      fair market value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The currency
      derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and are
      based upon third-party quotes.


Note
      18. Retirement Plans

Our
      company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number
      of
      our employees. These plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit
      plans, and other postretirement plans:

-

our
                defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return
                for
                services rendered. These plans provide an individual account for
                each
                participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the
                participant’s account are to be determined rather than the amount of
                pension benefits the participant is to receive. Contributions to
                these
                plans are based on pretax income and/or discretionary amounts determined
                on an annual basis. Our expense for the defined contribution plans
                for
                both continuing and discontinued operations totaled $164 million
                in 2005,
                $147 million in 2004, and $87 million in 2003. Additionally, we
                participate in a Canadian multi-employer plan to which we contributed
                $24
                million and $20 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. For 2004,
                we
                amended certain defined contribution plans to allow for a non-elective
                contribution, which resulted in an increase of $53 million over the
                expense;

-

our
                defined benefit plans include both funded and unfunded pension plans,
                which define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually
                as a
                function of age, years of service, or compensation;
                and

-

our
                postretirement medical plans are offered to specific eligible employees.
                These plans are contributory. For some plans, our liability is limited
                to
                a fixed contribution amount for each participant or dependent. The
                plan
                participants share the total cost for all benefits provided above
                our
                fixed contributions. Participants’ contributions are adjusted as required
                to cover benefit payments. We have made no commitment to adjust the
                amount
                of our contributions; therefore, the computed accumulated postretirement
                benefit obligation amount is not affected by the expected future
                health
                care cost inflation rate.

Dresser
      Retiree Medical

Through
      2003, we were responsible for the majority of the costs for the Dresser Retiree
      Medical Plan. An amendment was made to this plan at the end of 2003 to limit
      our
      share of the costs and eventually eliminate the plan in 2005. We presented
      the
      impact of this amendment in our 2003 notes to consolidated financial statements,
      which reduced our projected benefit obligation by $86 million and increased
      our
      unrecognized prior service benefit by the same amount, with no impact to our
      balance sheet or statement of operations. In December 2004, the United States
      District Court ruled that we must continue to maintain the Dresser Retiree
      Medical Plan as we had in the past. We revised our 2003 presentation of the
      projected benefit obligation and unrecognized prior service benefit to reflect
      the plan at its pre-amendment amounts. We also adjusted our annual
      postretirement benefit expense by $13 million in the fourth quarter of
      2004.

Benefit
      obligation and plan assets

Plan
      assets, expenses, and obligation for retirement plans in the following tables
      include both continuing and discontinued operations. We use a September 30
      measurement date for our international plans and an October 31 measurement
      date
      for our domestic plans.


Our
      target allocations for 2006 by asset category and our pension plan asset

Our
      investment strategy varies by country depending on the circumstances of the
      underlying plan. Typically, less mature plan benefit obligations are funded
      by
      using more equity securities, as they are expected to achieve long-term growth
      while exceeding inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded
      using
      more fixed income securities, as they are expected to produce current income
      with limited volatility. Risk management practices include the use of multiple
      asset classes and investment managers within each asset class for
      diversification purposes. Specific guidelines for each asset class and
      investment manager are implemented and monitored.

Funded
      status

The
      funded status of the plans, reconciled to the amount reported on the
      consolidated balance sheets, was as follows:

Amounts
      recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

We
      recognized an additional minimum pension liability for the underfunded defined
      benefit plans of $72 million in 2005, of which $54 million was recorded as
      “other comprehensive income.” We reduced our additional minimum pension
      liability by $164 million in 2004, of which $115 million was recorded as “Other
      comprehensive income.” The additional minimum liability is equal to the excess
      of the accumulated benefit obligation over plan assets and accrued liabilities.
      A corresponding amount is recognized as either an intangible asset or a change
      to accumulated other comprehensive income.

The
      projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value
      of
      plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess
      of plan assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as
      follows:

Contributions.

Funding
      requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country
      where such plan resides. In certain countries the funding requirements are
      mandatory while in other countries they are discretionary. We currently expect
      to contribute $160 million to our international pension plans in 2006. For
      our
      domestic plans, we expect our contributions to be no more than $4 million in
      2006. In order to mitigate a portion of the projected underfunding of our United
      Kingdom pension plans, ESG contributed $38 million and KBR contributed $74
      million in February 2006. These amounts are included in the $160 million 2006
      funding obligation. We do not have a required minimum contribution for our
      domestic plans; however, we may make additional discretionary contributions,
      which will be determined after the actuarial valuations are
      complete.

Assumptions

Assumed
      long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit
      obligations, and rates of compensation increases vary for the different plans
      according to the local economic conditions. The rates used were as
      follows:

The
      weighted average assumptions for the Nigerian and Indonesian plans are not
      included in the above tables as the plans were immaterial. The discount rate
      was
      determined based on the rates of return of high-quality fixed income investments
      as of the measurement date. Our discount rate assumption for the United States
      domestic pension plans was based on the weighted average annualized yield of
      the
      Moody Baa-Aaa corporate bonds. For our United Kingdom pension plans, which
      constitute 95% of our international pension plans’ projected benefit obligation,
      the discount rate was based on the annualized yield of the iBoxx AA corporate
      bonds, and was reduced from 5.5% at December 31, 2004 to 5.0% at December 31,
      2005. This decrease in the discount rate resulted in increases in the present
      value of our benefit obligations.

The
      overall expected long-term rate of return on assets was determined based upon
      an
      evaluation of our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into
      account current and expected market conditions.

The
      FASB
      issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
      an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (FIN 46), in January 2003. In December 2003,
      the FASB issued FIN 46R, a revision that supersedes the original interpretation.
      We adopted FIN 46R effective January 1, 2004.

FIN
      46R
      requires the consolidation of entities in which a company absorbs a majority
      of
      another entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the other entity’s
      expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual,
      or
      other financial interests in the other entity. Previously, entities were
      generally consolidated based upon a controlling financial interest through
      ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity.

The
      following details our variable interests in variable interest entities by
      business segment.

Production
      Optimization segment:

-

during
                the second quarter of 2001, we formed a joint venture, WellDynamics,
                with
                Shell in which we held a 50% equity interest and accounted for the
                investment using the equity method in our Digital and Consulting
                Solutions
                segment. The joint venture was established for the further development
                and
                deployment of new technologies related to completions and well
                intervention services and products. In the first quarter of 2004,
                Halliburton and Shell restructured WellDynamics whereby Halliburton
                acquired an additional 1% of WellDynamics from Shell, giving Halliburton
                51% ownership and control of day-to-day operations. The joint venture
                is
                considered a variable interest entity under FIN 46, and we have determined
                that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Beginning in the
                first
                quarter of 2004, WellDynamics was consolidated. The consolidation
                of
                WellDynamics resulted in an increase to our goodwill of $109 million,
                which was previously carried as equity method goodwill in our investment
                balance, and an increase in long-term debt of $27 million. There
                are no
                assets of WellDynamics that collateralize its
                obligations;


Government
      and Infrastructure segment:

-

during
                2001, we formed a joint venture that owns and operates heavy equipment
                transport vehicles in the United Kingdom and in which we own a 50%
                equity
                interest with an unrelated partner. This variable interest entity
                was
                formed to construct, operate, and service certain assets for a third
                party
                and was funded with third-party debt. The construction of the assets
                was
                completed in the second quarter of 2004, and the operating and service
                contract related to the assets extends through 2023. The proceeds
                from the
                debt financing were used to construct the assets and will be paid
                down
                with cash flows generated during the operation and service phase
                of the
                contract with the third party. As of December 31, 2005, the joint
                venture
                had total assets of $147 million and total liabilities of $152 million.
                Our aggregate exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with
                this
                joint venture is limited to our equity investment and subordinated
                debt of
                $7 million and any future losses related to the operation of the
                assets.
                We are not the primary beneficiary. The joint venture is accounted
                for
                under the equity method of
                accounting;

-

we
                are involved in three privately funded initiatives executed through
                joint
                ventures to design, build, operate, and maintain roadways for certain
                government agencies in the United Kingdom. We have a 25% ownership
                interest in these joint ventures and account for them under the equity
                method. The joint ventures have obtained financing through third
                parties
                that is not guaranteed by us. These joint ventures are considered
                variable
                interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of these joint
                ventures and, therefore, account for them using the equity method.
                As of
                December 31, 2005, these joint ventures had total assets of $1.4
                billion
                and total liabilities of $1.5 billion. Our maximum exposure to loss
                is
                limited to our equity investments in and loans to the joint ventures,
                which totaled $35 million at December 31,
                2005;

-

we
                participate in a privately funded initiative executed through an
                unincorporated joint venture and operating company formed for operating
                and maintaining a railroad freight business in Australia. We own
                36.7% of
                the joint venture and operating company and we are accounting for
                these
                investments using the equity method. This joint venture is considered
                a
                variable interest entity. The joint venture is funded through senior
                and
                subordinated debt and equity contributions from the joint venture
                partners. We are not the primary beneficiary of the joint venture.
                As of
                December 31, 2005, the joint venture had total assets of $796 million
                and
                total liabilities of $672 million. Our maximum exposure to loss is
                limited
                to our equity investments and senior operating notes in the joint
                venture
                and the operating company totaling $81 million and our commit to
                fund an
                additional $9 million of notes to the operating company as of December
                31,
                2005; and

-

we
                participate in a privately funded initiative executed through certain
                joint ventures formed to design, build, operate, and maintain a viaduct
                and several bridges in southern Ireland. The joint ventures were
                funded
                through debt and were formed with very little equity. We have up
                to a 25%
                ownership interest in the project’s joint ventures, and we are accounting
                for this interest under the equity method. These joint ventures are
                considered variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary
                of the joint ventures. As of December 31, 2005, the joint ventures
                had
                total assets of $239 million and total liabilities of $226 million.
                Our
                maximum exposure to loss is limited to our equity investments in
                and loan
                to the joint venture, totaling $4 million at December 31, 2005, and
                our
                share of any future losses resulting from the
                project.

Energy
      and Chemicals segment:

We
      perform many of our long-term energy-related construction projects through
      incorporated or unincorporated joint ventures. Typically, these ventures are
      dissolved upon completion of the project. Many of these ventures are funded
      by
      advances from the project owner and, accordingly, require no equity investment
      by the joint venture partners or shareholders. Occasionally, a venture incurs
      losses, which then requires funding by the joint venture partners or
      shareholders in proportion to their interest percentages. The ventures with
      little or no initial equity investment are considered variable interest
      entities. Our significant variable interest entities are:


-

during
                2005, we formed a joint venture to engineer and construct a gas
                monetization facility. We own a 50% equity interest and determined
                that we
                are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The joint venture
                is
                consolidated. At December 31, 2005, the joint venture’s had $324 million
                in total assets and $311 million in total liabilities. There are
                no
                consolidated assets that collateralize the joint venture obligations,
                however at December 31, 2005, the joint venture had approximately
                $173
                million of cash which relates to advance billings in connection with
                the
                joint venture’s obligations under the EPC contract;
                and

-

we
                also have equity ownership in three joint ventures to execute EPC
                projects. Our equity ownership ranges from 33% to 50%, and these
                joint
                ventures are considered variable interest entities. We are not the
                primary
                beneficiary, and we account for these joint ventures under the equity
                method. At December 31, 2005, these joint ventures had aggregate
                assets of
                $861 million and aggregate liabilities of $912
                million.

Note
      20. Reorganization of Business Operations

Effective
      October 1, 2004, we restructured KBR into two segments, Government and
      Infrastructure and Energy and Chemicals. In 2004, we recorded restructuring
      and
      related costs of $40 million related to the reorganization. The total
      restructuring charges consisted of $31 million in personnel termination benefits
      and $9 million in impairment charges on technology-related assets. For the
      year
      ended December 31, 2004, $32 million of the restructuring charge was included
      in
“Cost of services” and $8 million was included in “General and administrative”
on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2005, all
      amounts related to the 2004 restructuring have been paid and the balance in
      the
      restructuring reserve account has been reduced to zero.

Note
      21. New Accounting Pronouncements

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), “Accounting for
      Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 143.” This statement clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a
      liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when
      incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. The
      provisions of FIN 47 were adopted as of December 31, 2005. The total liability
      recorded at adoption for asset retirement obligations and the related accretion
      and depreciation expense for all periods presented is immaterial to our
      consolidated financial position and results of operations. We own properties
      where we have below ground storage tanks, test wells, and other items that
      are
      required to be removed before we vacate the properties. A liability has not
      been
      recorded for these items because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated.
      We believe there is an indeterminate settlement date for these obligations
      because the range of time over which we may settle the obligation is unknown
      or
      cannot be estimated.

      flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005,
      which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection
      with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we
      also
      audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule (Schedule II)
