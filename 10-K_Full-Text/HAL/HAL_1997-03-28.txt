PART I

Item  1. Business.
     General  Development of Business.  Halliburton  Company's  predecessor  was
established  in 1919,  incorporated  under the laws of the state of  Delaware in
1924  and  reorganized  under  the  laws  of the  State  of  Delaware  in  1996.
Halliburton  Company (the Company)  provides energy services and engineering and
construction  services.  Information related to acquisitions and dispositions is
set forth in Note 15 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.
     Financial Information About Business Segments.  The Company is comprised of
two business  segments.  See Note 9 to the  financial  statements of this Annual
Report for financial information about these two business segments.
     Description  of Services and  Products.  The  following is a summary  which
briefly describes the Company's services and products for each business segment.
     The Energy  Group  business  segment  provides a wide range of services and
products  to provide  integrated  solutions  to  customers  in the  exploration,
development  and  production  of oil and natural gas. The Energy Group  operates
worldwide,  serving major oil companies,  independent operators and national oil
companies.  The segment  includes  Halliburton  Energy  Services,  which  offers
drilling systems and services,  pressure pumping equipment and services, logging
and  perforating  products and services,  specialized  completion and production
equipment  and  services and well control  products and  services;  Brown & Root
Energy Services, which provides upstream oil and gas engineering,  construction,
project management and maintenance activities, subsea construction,  fabrication
and  installation  of  subsea  pipelines,  offshore  platforms,  and  production
platforms,  marine  engineering  and other  marine  related  projects;  Landmark
Graphics  Corporation,  which  provides  integrated  exploration  and production
information   systems  and  professional   services;   and  Halliburton   Energy
Development,  which has been  formed to create  business  opportunities  for the
development, production and operation of customers' oil and gas fields.
     The Engineering and Construction Group provides conceptual design,  process
design, detailed engineering,  procurement, project and construction management,
construction of chemical and petrochemical  plants,  refineries,  pulp and paper
mills,  metal processing  plants,  highways and bridges,  technical and economic
feasibility  studies,  site evaluation,  contract maintenance and operations and
maintenance   services  for  both  industry  and  government,   engineering  and
environmental  consulting and waste management services for industry,  utilities
and government, and remedial engineering and construction services for hazardous
waste sites.
     Markets  and  Competition.  The  Company  is  one of  the  world's  largest
diversified energy services and engineering and construction services companies.
The  Company's  services  and products  are sold in highly  competitive  markets
throughout the world.  Competition in both services and products is based upon a
combination of price,  service  (including  the ability to deliver  services and
products on an "as needed, where needed" basis),  product quality,  warranty and
technical proficiency. Some customers have indicated a preference for integrated
services and solutions.  These integrated  solutions,  in the case of the Energy
Group,  relate to all phases of exploration  and production of oil and gas, and,
in the case of the Engineering and Construction  group,  relate to all phases of
design,  procurement,  construction,  project  management  and  maintenance of a
facility. Demand for these types of integrated solutions is based primarily upon
quality of service, technical proficiency and overall price.
     The Company conducts  business  worldwide in over 100 countries.  Since the
market for the  Company's  services  and  products is so large and crosses  many
geographic lines, a meaningful  estimate of the number of competitors  cannot be
made.  The  markets  are,  however,  highly  competitive  with many  substantial
companies  operating  in each  market.  Generally,  the  Company's  services and
products are marketed through its own servicing and sales organizations. A small
percentage of sales of the Energy Group's  products is made by supply stores and
third-party representatives.
     Operations  in  some  countries  may be  affected  by  unsettled  political
conditions,  expropriation or other governmental  actions,  and exchange control
and currency  problems.  The Company believes the geographic  diversification of
its business  activities reduces the risk that loss of its operations in any one
country  would be material to the  conduct of its  operations  taken as a whole.
Information regarding the Company's exposures to foreign currency  fluctuations,
risk  concentration and financial  instruments used to minimize risk is included
in Note 11 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.







     Customers and Backlog. In 1996, 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  73%, 78% and
78% of the  Company's  revenues  were  derived  from  the sale of  products  and
services to,  including  construction  for, the energy  industry.  The following
schedule summarizes the backlog of projects at December 31, 1996 and 1995:


     It is  estimated  that nearly 65% of the backlog  existing at December  31,
1996 will be completed during 1997. The Company's backlog excludes contracts for
recurring  hardware and software  maintenance and support services.  The Company
does not believe that backlog  should  necessarily be relied on as an indication
of  future  operating   results  since  such  backlog  figures  are  subject  to
substantial fluctuations. Arrangements included in backlog are in many instances
extremely complex,  nonrepetitive in nature and may fluctuate in contract value.
Many contracts do not provide for a fixed amount and are subject to modification
or  termination  by the  customer.  Due to the size of  certain  contracts,  the
termination  or  modification  of any one or more  contracts  or the addition of
other contracts may have a substantial and immediate effect on backlog.
     Raw  Materials.  Raw  materials  essential  to the  Company's  business are
normally readily available.  Where the Company is dependent on a single supplier
for any materials  essential to its business,  the Company is confident  that it
could make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of interruption in
the supply of such materials.
     Research, Development and Patents. The Company maintains an active research
and development  program to assist in the  improvement of existing  products and
processes,  the development of new products and processes and the improvement of
engineering  standards  and  practices  that  serve  the  changing  needs of its
customers.  Information relating to expenditures for research and development is
included in Note 1 to the financial statements of this Annual Report.
     The Company  owns a large  number of patents and has pending a  substantial
number of patent  applications  covering  various  products and  processes.  The
Company is also licensed  under  patents  owned by others.  The Company does not
consider a particular patent or group of patents to be material to the Company's
business.
     Seasonality.  Weather  and natural  phenomena  can  temporarily  affect the
performance of the Company's services.  Winter months in the Northern Hemisphere
tend to affect operations negatively,  but the widespread geographical locations
of the Company's services serve to mitigate the seasonal nature of the Company's
business.
     Employees.  At December 31, 1996 the Company employed  approximately 60,000
people of which 23,500 were located outside the United States.
     Regulation.  The  Company  is subject  to  various  environmental  laws and
regulations.   Compliance  with  such  requirements  has  neither  substantially
increased capital  expenditures or adversely affected the Company's  competitive
position,  nor materially affected the Company's earnings.  The Company does not
anticipate  any such material  adverse  effects in the  foreseeable  future as a
result  of  such  existing  laws  and  regulations.  Note  10 to  the  financial
statements  of this Annual  Report  discusses  the  Company's  involvement  as a
potentially  responsible  party in  remedial  activities  to  clean  up  various
"Superfund" sites.

Item 2.   Properties.
     Information  relating  to  lease  payments  is  included  in Note 10 to the
financial  statements  of this Annual  Report.  The  Company's  owned and leased
facilities,  as described  below,  are suitable and adequate for their  intended

Leiderdorp,  Holland.  One of two  facilities  in Houston was idle at the end of
1996.  The  Energy  Group  also  owns  marine  fabrication  facilities  covering
approximately  523 acres in Belle Chasse,  Louisiana;  Greens Bayou,  Texas; and
Nigg and Wick,  Scotland.  The Belle Chasse,  Louisiana  facility  consisting of
approximately  165 acres is idle.  The  facility in Nigg,  Scotland is leased to
another  company.  The Group sold its 35% owned marine  fabrication  facility in
Sundra  Strait,  Indonesia  during 1996.  In addition,  service  centers,  sales
offices and field warehouses are operated at approximately  200 locations in the
United States, almost all of which are owned, and at approximately 270 locations
outside the United States in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
     The Engineering and Construction Group owns fabricating facilities covering
approximately  441,000 square feet in Houston,  Texas,  and Edmonton,  Canada of
which 388,000 square feet in Houston is leased to another  Company.  Engineering
and design,  project management and procurement  services activities are carried
out in owned facilities covering approximately 3,600,000 square feet in Houston,
Texas; Edmonton,  Canada;  Leatherhead,  England; and Aberdeen,  Scotland. These
activities  are also  carried out at leased  facilities  covering  approximately
1,100,000 square feet in Mobile, Alabama;  Alhambra,  California;  Gaithersburg,
Maryland; Pittsburg,  Pennsylvania; Aiken, South Carolina; Eastleigh and London,
England;  Kuala  Lumpur,  Malaysia;  Stavanger,  Norway;  Singapore;   Aberdeen,
Scotland;  Al Khobar,  Saudi Arabia; and Bahrain. In addition,  project offices,
field camps,  laboratories,  service centers,  and sales offices are operated at
approximately 60 locations in the United States,  almost all of which are leased
by the Company,  and at approximately  30 foreign  locations in both the Eastern
and Western Hemispheres.
     General Corporate operates from leased facilities in Dallas, Texas covering
approximately  55,000 square feet. The Company also leases  approximately  5,500
square  feet of  space  in  Washington,  D.C.  and owns an  85,000  square  foot
mainframe data processing center in Arlington,  Texas which is leased to another
company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK
     The Company  operates in over 100  countries  around the world to provide a
variety of energy services and engineering and construction  services to energy,
industrial  and  governmental  customers.  Operations  in some  countries may be
affected by unsettled political conditions,  expropriation or other governmental
actions,  and exchange control and currency  devaluations.  The Company believes
the geographic  diversification of its business activities reduces the risk that
loss of its operations in any one country would be material to its  consolidated
results of  operations.  However,  United  States law imposes a variety of trade
sanctions  restricting the ability of the Company, and in some cases its foreign
subsidiaries,  to conduct business in some countries where there are markets for
the  Company's  goods  and  services.  In the  future,  certain  of these  trade
sanctions  may adversely  affect the ability of the Company to conduct  business
with foreign customers having activities in certain countries such as Cuba, Iran
or Libya which are targeted by the United States,  including restrictions on the
Company's  ability to do business  with such  customers in unrelated  countries.
Currently,   discussions   are  ongoing  in  the  United  States   Congress  and
Administration  concerning  imposition  of  further  trade  sanctions  affecting
countries  such as  Algeria,  Nigeria,  Colombia  and  Myanmar.  Many  of  these
countries are important markets for the Company and new trade restrictions which
impair the ability of the Company  and/or its  customers to conduct  business in
these countries could adversely  affect the results of the Company's  operations
in some future period.
     Energy Group.  In 1996,  the energy  industry  experienced a year of strong
growth, as customers worldwide expanded their petroleum exploration, development
and  production  activities.  Customer  activities  increased  in  response to a
combination  of factors  including  higher  crude oil and  natural  gas  prices,
improvement in the long-term  demand growth  outlook for the petroleum  industry
and  available  investment  opportunities  with  desirable  economic  potential.
Customer  economics  are  also  being  enhanced  by  increased   utilization  of
integrated  solutions,  partnering and alliance  arrangements designed to reduce
the per barrel cost of finding, developing and producing hydrocarbons.  Although
customers have given early  indications  they plan to increase their spending in
1997,  recent  crude oil and  natural gas price  declines  may  constrain  their
anticipated  cash  flow  which  may,  in  turn,  reduce  or defer  some  planned
activities.
     Engineering and Construction Group.  Opportunities are good; however, those
opportunities are increasingly  complex and competition remains intense. The key
drivers of improved  margins will be partnering on larger jobs,  accepting  more
risk through gain sharing or fixed price contract  arrangements,  broadening the
service base in core competencies,  acquiring proprietary knowledge and managing
costs.
     Landmark  acquisition.  On October  4,  1996,  the  Company  completed  its
acquisition  of  all  of the  outstanding  common  stock  of  Landmark  Graphics
Corporation  in exchange for  approximately  10.2 million  shares of Halliburton
Company Common Stock. See Note 13 to the financial statements.
     Realignment of product and service lines.  During 1996, prior to the fourth
quarter, the Company operated through two business segments, Energy Services and
Engineering  and  Construction  Services.  Beginning  with the fourth quarter of
1996,  the Company  realigned the business units making up these two segments in
order to better meet the needs of its  customers  and  capitalize on the synergy
between business units.  The Company's two business  segments are now called the
Energy  Group and the  Engineering  and  Construction  Group.  The Energy  Group
business segment consists of Halliburton Energy Services,  which offers drilling
systems and services,  pressure  pumping  equipment  and  services,  logging and
perforating  products  and  services,   specialized  completion  and  production
equipment and services and well control products;  Brown & Root Energy Services,
which  includes  upstream  oil  and  gas  engineering,   construction,   project
management and maintenance  activities;  Landmark  Graphics  Corporation,  which
includes   integrated   exploration  and  production   information  systems  and
professional services; and Halliburton Energy Development, which has been formed
to create business  opportunities for the development,  production and operation
of customers' oil and gas fields.
     The  Engineering  and  Construction  Group  consists of two business  units
offering engineering, construction, project management, facilities operation and
maintenance  and  environmental   services.  To  more  closely  align  with  its
customers,   one  business  unit  will  focus  on  delivering   engineering  and
construction  services  to  commercial  customers  and the other  will  focus on
servicing  government  customers at all levels.  The cost of  implementing  this
program,  along with the combination of various administrative support functions
into combined  shared  services for the Company,  is reflected in the 1996 third
quarter $65.3 million pre-tax charge. See Note 16 to the financial statements.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     Revenues  for 1996 were  $7,385.1  million,  an  increase  of 26% over 1995
revenues  of  $5,882.9  million  and an  increase  of 30% over 1994  revenues of
$5,661.1 million.  Approximately 55% of the Company's consolidated revenues were
derived from international  activities in 1996 compared with 51% in 1995 and 45%
in 1994.
     Energy Group 1996 revenues were $4,286.3  million,  an increase of 19% over
1995  revenues of $3,604.0 and an increase of 27% over 1994 revenues of $3,364.0
million.  The Energy Group's increase in revenues  compares to an 8% increase in
the  worldwide  rotary rig count for 1996  compared to 1995 and a 3% increase in
the worldwide rotary rig count for 1996 compared to 1994. Approximately 67%, 67%
and  63%  of  the  Energy  Group's  revenues  were  derived  from  international
activities for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Engineering and Construction Group revenues were $3,098.8 million for 1996,
an increase of 36% over 1995 revenues of $2,278.9 million and an increase of 35%
over 1994  revenues  of  $2,297.1  million.  The  increase  in  revenues  is due
primarily  to  higher  levels  of  activity  in the  Group's  pulp and paper and
chemical  operations as well as a service  contract with the U.S.  Department of
Defense to provide  technical and logistical  support for military  peacekeeping
operations in Bosnia.
     Operating income was $417.9 million for 1996 compared to $400.9 million for
1995 and $239.8 million for 1994.  Excluding  special  charges of $85.8 million,
$8.4  million  and $16.6  million  during  1996,  1995 and  1994,  respectively,
operating  income  for 1996  increased  by 23% over 1995 and by 96% over 1994 as
shown in the following table. See Note 16 to the financial statements.


     Approximately  66% of  the  Company's  consolidated  operating  income  was
derived from  international  activities in 1996 compared to 65% for 1995 and 40%
for 1994.  Consolidated  international  operating margins were 8%, 9% and 4% for
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Energy  Group  operating  income in 1996 was  $484.4  million  in 1996,  an
increase of 22% over 1995  operating  income of $398.2 million and 83% over 1994
operating income of $264.1 million.  Operating margins were 11% in 1996 compared
with 11% for 1995 and 8% for 1994.  Approximately 62%, 66% and 41% of the Energy
Group's  operating  income was derived from  international  activities for 1996,
1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Operating  income growth for  Halliburton  Energy
Services in 1996 is due primarily to substantially  increased  services provided
in North America and Europe and, to a lesser degree,  increases in Latin America
and the Middle East.  Margin  increases were  strongest in the pressure  pumping
business.  Lower operating margins in 1994 were due to decreased activity levels
in the North Sea,  Middle East,  and Asia,  market  disturbances  in Nigeria and
Yemen,  unsettled  political  and business  conditions  in the  Commonwealth  of
Independent  States,  and pricing  pressures in the United States.  Energy Group
results for 1996 include $35 million of gain sharing revenue on the Brown & Root
Energy Services' portion of the cost savings realized on the BP Andrew alliance.
The  alliance  completed  the  project  seven  months  ahead  of  the  scheduled
production of oil and achieved a $125 million savings compared with the targeted
cost. The effect of the gain sharing was offset by a $20.7 million  reduction in
operating  income due to lower  activity  levels by its 50% owned joint venture,
European Marine Contractors, Limited.
     Engineering and Construction  Group operating income for 1996 increased 20%
over 1995 and 253% over 1994 to $53.7 million. Operating margins were 2%, 2% and
1% for  1996,  1995  and  1994,  respectively.  During  1996,  operating  income
increases in petroleum  and chemical  services as well as income from  technical
and logistical support services for military  peacekeeping  operations in Bosnia
were  partially  offset by a $17.1 million  charge for the impairment of Brown &
Root's  investment  in the Dulles  Greenway  toll road  extension  project.  The
Group's contract to provide services in Bosnia ends in 1997.




     Consolidated  general  and  administrative  expenses  for 1996 were  $236.6
million  compared  to  $221.7  million  and  $232.1  million  for 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
     The Company sold its natural gas compression business, geophysical products
and services business and workover platform business in 1994.
     Interest expense  decreased to $24.1 million for 1996 from $47.1 million in
1995 and $48.1  million  in 1994 due to the  redemption  of the  Company's  zero
coupon convertible  subordinated debentures in September 1995 and the redemption
of its $42.0 million term loan in December 1995.
     Interest  income  decreased to $14.2 million for 1996 from $32.0 million in
1995 and $19.8 million in 1994 due to lower  amounts of invested cash  resulting
from the debt redeemed in 1995.
     Foreign  currency gains  (losses)  netted to a loss of $3.9 million in 1996
compared  to a $1.4  million  gain in 1995  and a $16.3  million  loss in  1994.
Current  year losses are due  primarily  to the  devaluation  of the  Venezuelan
bolivar.  The loss in 1994  related  primarily  to  devaluations  in Brazil  and
Venezuela.
     Provision  for  income  taxes was lower in 1996 than in 1995 and 1994.  The
effective income tax rate was 26% in 1996,  compared with 36% in 1995 and 41% in
1994.  The lower  effective  income tax rate and  provision  for 1996 are due to
credits of $43.7 million recorded during the third quarter to recognize  certain
net operating loss  carryforwards  and the settlement of various issues with the
Internal  Revenue  Service.  Excluding  the tax benefits  recorded in 1996,  the
effective income tax rate was 36%. See Note 16 to the financial statements.
     Income  from  continuing  operations  for  1996,  1995 and  1994 of  $300.4
million, $249.2 million and $175.4 million, respectively, resulted in income per
share from continuing operations of $2.38, $2.00 and $1.41, respectively.
     Discontinued  operations  in  1995  and  1994  consists  of  the  Company's
Insurance  Services Group.  The Company declared a dividend on December 26, 1995
and  subsequently  distributed its property and casualty  insurance  subsidiary,
Highlands  Insurance  Group,  Inc.  (HIGI)  to its  shareholders  in a  tax-free
spin-off on January 23, 1996.  The  operations of the Insurance  Services  Group
have been classified as discontinued operations. During 1995, HIGI increased its
reserves for claim losses and related  expenses and provisions for certain legal
matters  which  together  with  certain  other  provisions  associated  with the
Company's  complete exit from the insurance industry resulted in a $67.2 million
charge against net earnings. See Note 14 to the financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company ended 1996 with cash and equivalents of $213.6 million compared
with $239.6 million in 1995 and $441.3 million in 1994. The decrease in cash and
equivalents  from 1994 is due to the  redemption  of debt  during 1995 of $432.7
million, partially offset by increased cash flows from operations.
     Cash flows from operating  activities were $452.0 million for 1996 compared
to $667.4  million  and  $439.0  million  for 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The
primary  use of cash by  operating  activities  was to  fund  increased  working
capital requirements related to increased revenues.
     Cash  flows used in  investing  activities  were  $409.4  million  for 1996
compared to $267.3 million used in 1995 and $183.4 million provided in 1994. The
increase in cash used for investing  activities  during 1996 is due primarily to
an increase in capital  expenditures  of 30% over 1995 and $41.3 million related
to the  Company's  share of the purchase  price of a subsidiary  acquired by the
Company's 36% owned affiliate,  M-I Drilling Fluids Company, L.L.C. In 1994, the
Company sold  substantially  all of the assets of its  geophysical  services and
products  business for $190.0 million and its natural gas  compression  business
for $205.0 million.
     Cash  flows  used in  financing  activities  were  $65.8  million  for 1996
compared to $599.0 million and $254.7  million for 1995 and 1994,  respectively.
Cash used for financing  activities during 1996 consisted  primarily of dividend
payments of $117.5 million offset by net short term  borrowings of $38.3 million
and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $25.6  million.  In 1995, the
increased  amount of cash used by financing  activities  is due primarily to the
redemption of the Company's  $390.7 million zero coupon  convertible  debentures
and $42.0 million term loan. In 1994, the Company  redeemed the remaining  $23.8
million of its 10.2%  debentures and made $48.8 million in  installments  on the
$73.8  million  note  issued  by the  Company  to the  buyer of its  geophysical
business.  Total debt was 10%, 10% and 25% of total capitalization at the end of
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     During January 1997, the Company  announced that it had offered to purchase
all of the outstanding shares of OGC International plc for approximately  $117.9
million. See Note 15 to the financial statements.




     On February 6, 1997, the Company issued $125.0 million  principal amount of
6.75%  notes due  February  1, 2027;  however,  each holder of the notes has the
right to require the Company to repay such holder's  notes, in whole or in part,
on February 1, 2007.  The  additional  funds will be used for general  corporate
purposes  which  may  include  repayment  of debt,  acquisitions,  and loans and
advances  to and/or  investments  in  subsidiaries  of the  Company  for working
capital, repayment of debt and capital expenditures. The Company has the ability
to borrow additional short-term and long-term funds if necessary.  See Note 6 to
the financial  statements  regarding the Company's  various  short-term lines of
credit, notes payable and long-term debt.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
     The  Company is  involved as a  potentially  responsible  party in remedial
activities to clean up various  "Superfund"  sites under applicable  Federal law
which  imposes  joint and  several  liability,  if the harm is  indivisible,  on
certain persons without regard to fault, the legality of the original  disposal,
or  ownership  of the  site.  Although  it is very  difficult  to  quantify  the
potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management of
the Company  believes  that any liability of the Company with respect to all but
one of such  sites  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the  results of
operations of the Company. See Note 10 to the financial statements.

FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
     In accordance  with the safe harbor  provisions  of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  the Company  notes that the  statements in this
annual report and elsewhere,  which are forward  looking and which provide other
than historical information, involve risks and uncertainties that may impact the
Company's actual results of operations. The Company continues to face many risks
and uncertainties including:  unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest,
currency  controls and  governmental  actions in countries of  operation;  trade
restrictions and economic embargoes;  environmental  laws,  including those that
require  emission  performance  standards for new and existing  facilities;  the
magnitude of  governmental  spending for military and logistical  support of the
type provided by the Company;  operations in high risk countries;  technological
and structural  changes in the industries served by the Company;  changes in the
price of oil and natural  gas;  changes in capital  spending by customers in the
hydrocarbon  industry  for  exploration,  development,  production,  processing,
refining  and  pipeline  delivery  networks;  changes  in  capital  spending  by
customers in the wood pulp and paper  industries for plants and  equipment;  and
changes in capital  spending by  governments  for  infrastructure.  In addition,
future trends for revenues and profitability  remain difficult to predict in the
industries served by the Company.







RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

     Halliburton Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of its
published financial  statements.  The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States
and,  as  such,  include  amounts  based  on  judgments  and  estimates  made by
management.  The Company  also  prepared the other  information  included in the
annual  report and is  responsible  for its  accuracy and  consistency  with the
financial statements.
     The financial  statements have been audited by the  independent  accounting
firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted  access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the
Board of Directors and committees of the Board.
     The  Company   maintains  a  system  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  which is intended to provide  reasonable  assurance to the Company's
management  and  Board of  Directors  regarding  the  preparation  of  financial
statements.  The  system  includes a  documented  organizational  structure  and
division of responsibility,  established policies and procedures including codes
of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate, which are communicated throughout
the Company, and the careful selection,  training and development of our people.
Internal  auditors  monitor the  operation  of the internal  control  system and
report  findings and  recommendations  to management and the Board of Directors,
and  corrective  actions  are taken to address  control  deficiencies  and other
opportunities  for  improving  the  system as they are  identified.  The  Board,
operating  through its audit committee,  which is composed entirely of Directors
who are not current or former  officers or employees  of the  Company,  provides
oversight to the financial reporting process.
     There  are  inherent  limitations  in the  effectiveness  of any  system of
internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or  overriding  of controls.  Accordingly,  even an effective  internal  control
system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.  Furthermore,  the  effectiveness of an internal control system may
change over time.
     The Company  assessed its internal  control  system in relation to criteria
for effective internal control over financial  reporting  described in "Internal
Control-Integrated   Framework"   issued   by  the   Committee   of   Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  upon that  assessment,  the
Company  believes that, as of December 31, 1996, its system of internal  control
over financial reporting met those criteria.

   and Chief Executive Officer                       and Chief Financial Officer








REPORT  OF  INDEPENDENT  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTANTS  To the  Shareholders  and Board of
Directors, Halliburton Company:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton
Company (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiary  companies as of December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
shareholders'  equity for each of the three years in the period  ended  December
31, 1996.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of Halliburton
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of Halliburton
Company  and  subsidiary  companies  as of December  31, 1996 and 1995,  and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31,  1996,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note  1. Significant Accounting Policies
     The  Company  employs  accounting  policies  that  are in  accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States. The preparation
of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  Company  management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements,  and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.
     Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  All material
intercompany  accounts and  transactions  are  eliminated.  Investments in other
affiliated  companies in which the Company has at least 20%  ownership  and does
not have management control are accounted for on the equity method. As discussed
in  Note  13,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Landmark  Graphics
Corporation  (Landmark) on October 4, 1996. The Company's  financial  statements
for 1996 and prior periods have been restated to reflect the combined results of
the  two  companies  under  the  pooling  of  interests  method.  Prior  to  the
acquisition,  Landmark had a fiscal year end of June 30, which has  subsequently
been  changed to conform to the  Company's  fiscal  year end. In  addition,  the
financial  statements  have been restated to reflect the  realignment of Brown &
Root's  energy  services  operations  into the  Energy  Group  (see  Note 9). In
connection  with the  discontinuance  of the  Company's  insurance  segment,  as
described in Note 14, the Company has adopted a classified balance sheet format.
Certain prior year amounts have been  reclassified  to conform with current year
presentation.
     Revenues  and  Income  Recognition.  The  Company  recognizes  revenues  as
services are rendered or products are shipped.  The distinction between services
and product sales is based upon the overall  business  intent of the  particular
business  operation.  Revenues from  construction  contracts are reported on the
percentage of completion  method of accounting  using  measurements  of progress
toward completion  appropriate for the work performed.  All known or anticipated
losses on any  contracts  are  provided  for  currently.  Claims for  additional
compensation  are  recognized  during  the  period  such  claims  are  resolved.
Post-contract  customer support agreements are recorded as deferred  maintenance
fees and recognized as revenue  ratably over the contract  period.  Training and
consulting service revenue is recognized as the services are performed.
     Research and Development.  Research and development expenses are charged to
income as incurred.  Such charges were $133.3 million in 1996, $113.1 million in
1995, and $127.8 million in 1994.
     Software  Development  Costs.  Costs of  developing  software  for sale are
charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological
feasibility  has  been  established  for  the  product.   Thereafter,   software
development  costs are  capitalized  until  the  software  is ready for  general
release to customers.  The Company  capitalized  software  development  costs of
$12.9  million  in 1996,  $8.8  million  in  1995,  and  $9.7  million  in 1994.
Amortization expense related to these costs was $12.5 million, $10.3 million and
$10.5 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Once the software is ready
for release,  amortization of the software development costs begins. Capitalized
software  development  costs are not  amortized  over periods which exceed three
years.
     Income Per Share.  Income per share is based on the weighted average number
of common  shares and common  share  equivalents  outstanding  during each year.
Common share equivalents  included in the computation  represent shares issuable
upon assumed exercise of stock options which have a dilutive effect.
     Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
     Receivables.  The Company's  receivables are generally not  collateralized.
Notes and accounts  receivable at December 31, 1996 include $24.9 million ($17.8
million at December 31, 1995) due from customers in accordance  with  applicable
retainage  provisions of  engineering  and  construction  contracts,  which will
become  billable upon future  deliveries or completion of such  contracts.  This
amount is expected to be collected during 1997.  Additionally,  other noncurrent
assets  include  $6.7  million  ($4.5  million  at  December  31,  1995) of such
retainage  which  is  expected  to be  collected  in years  subsequent  to 1997.
Unbilled work on  uncompleted  contracts  generally  represents  work  currently
billable and such work is usually billed during normal billing  processes in the
next month.
     Inventories.  Inventories  are  stated  at cost  which is not in  excess of
market.  Cost  represents  invoice or production cost for new items and original
cost  less  allowance  for  condition  for  used  material  returned  to  stock.
Production cost includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead. About forty
percent  of all sales  items are valued on a last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  basis.




Inventories  of sales items owned by foreign  subsidiaries  and  inventories  of
operating supplies and parts are generally valued at average cost.
     Depreciation,  Amortization and Maintenance. Depreciation and amortization,
including  amortization  of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired,  for  financial  reporting  purposes is  calculated  primarily  on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets not exceeding
40 years.  Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are expensed;  expenditures
for renewals and improvements are generally capitalized. Upon sale or retirement
of an asset,  the related cost and accumulated  depreciation or amortization are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.  In the event that
facts and circumstances  indicate that assets may be impaired,  an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed.  If an evaluation is required,  the estimated
future  undiscounted  cash flows  associated with the asset would be compared to
the asset's  carrying  amount to determine  if a  write-down  to market value or
discounted cash flow value is required.
     Income Taxes. A valuation  allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not these items will either  expire before the Company is
able to realize their  benefit,  or that future  deductibility  is prohibited or
uncertain.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax  consequences  of events  that have been  realized  in the  financial
statements or tax returns.
     Derivative  Instruments.  The  Company  enters  into  derivative  financial
transactions  to hedge  existing or  projected  exposures  to  changing  foreign
exchange rates,  interest  rates,  security  prices,  or commodity  prices.  The
Company does not enter into derivative  transactions  for speculative or trading
purposes.  Derivative financial transactions are generally carried at fair value
with the resulting gains and losses reflected in the results of operations.
     Foreign Currency Translation. Foreign entities whose functional currency is
the U.S. dollar translate  monetary assets and liabilities at year-end  exchange
rates and  non-monetary  items are  translated at historical  rates.  Income and
expense  accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year,
except  for  depreciation  and cost of product  sales  which are  translated  at
historical rates.  Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are recognized
in  consolidated  income  in the  year of  occurrence.  Foreign  entities  whose
functional currency is the local currency translate net assets at year-end rates
and income and expense accounts at average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting
from these translations are reflected in the Shareholders' Equity section titled
"Cumulative translation adjustment".

Note 2.  Inventories
     Inventories at December 31, 1996 and 1995 are comprised of the following:


     If the  average  cost  method had been in use for  inventories  on the LIFO
basis,  total  inventories would have been about $13.0 million and $18.3 million
higher than reported at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Note 4.  Related Companies
     The Company conducts some of its operations through various joint ventures,
which  are in  partnership,  corporate  and  other  business  forms,  which  are
principally  accounted  for using the equity  method.  Included in the Company's
revenues  for 1996,  1995 and 1994 are equity in income of related  companies of
$105.5 million, $88.4 million and $93.0 million, respectively.  When the Company
sells or transfers  assets to an affiliated  company that is accounted for using
the equity method and the affiliated  company  records the assets at fair value,
the excess of the fair value of the assets over the  Company's net book value is
deferred and  amortized  over the expected  lives of the assets.  Such  deferred
gains included in the Company's  other  liabilities  were $3.7 million and $10.1
million  at  December  31,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Summarized  financial
statements for European Marine  Contractors,  Limited, a 50% owned company which
specializes in engineering,  procurement and  construction of marine  pipelines,
and  for  the  remaining   combined  jointly  owned  operations  which  are  not
consolidated are as follows:







Note 5.  Income Taxes
     The components of the (provision) benefit for income taxes are:

     Included in income  taxes are foreign tax credits of $63.7  million in 1996
and $35.2  million in 1995.  The U.S.  and  foreign  components  of income  from
continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests are as follows:


     The primary components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities
and the related valuation allowances are as follows:




     The Company has foreign tax credits  which  expire in 1999 of $1.0  million
and in 2000 of $28.8 million.  The Company has net operating loss  carryforwards
which expire as follows:  1997, $8.9 million;  1998, $18.0 million;  1999, $20.7
million;  2000 through 2010,  $41.3  million;  and  indefinite,  $87.4  million.
Reconciliations between the actual benefit (provision) for income taxes and that
computed by applying the U.S.  statutory rate to income or loss from  continuing
operations before income taxes and minority interests are as follows:


     The Company has received  statutory  notices of deficiency for the 1990 and
1991 tax years from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) of $92.9  million and
$16.8 million,  respectively,  excluding any penalties or interest.  The Company
believes it has  meritorious  defenses  and does not expect  that any  liability
resulting  from the 1990 or 1991 tax years  will  result in a  material  adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position.  In 1996, the Company
reached  settlements with the IRS for certain matters including the 1989 taxable
year.  As a result of the  settlement  for the 1989  taxable  year,  the Company
recognized  tax benefits and net income was  increased by $16.1  million in 1996
(see Note 16).

Note 6.  Lines of Credit, Notes Payable, and Long-Term Debt
     At December 31, 1996, the Company had committed  short-term lines of credit
totaling  $185.0 million  available and unused,  and other  short-term  lines of
credit  totaling  $275.0  million,  under which $25.0 million in borrowings were
outstanding  with several U.S. banks.  The interest rate on these borrowings was
5.65%.  In  addition,  the Company had $21.3  million of other  short-term  debt
outstanding at December 31, 1996,  primarily consisting of commercial paper with
an  interest  rate of 5.85%.  The  $100.0  million  revolving  credit  agreement
maintained  by  Landmark  prior to the merger  (see Note 13) was  terminated  on
October 7, 1996.
     Long-term debt at December 31, 1996 and 1995 consists of the following:


     The Company's  8.75%  debentures  due February 15, 2021 do not have sinking
fund  requirements and are not redeemable prior to maturity.  In September 1995,
the Company redeemed all of its zero coupon convertible  subordinated debentures
due March 13, 2006 for $390.7 million in cash,  which  represented  the original
issue price plus accrued  original  issue  discount to the  redemption  date. In
addition,  in December 1995, the Company  redeemed all of its $42.0 million term
loan at LIBOR plus 0.45%. Long-term debt of $0.1 million matures during 1997 and
there are no other maturities due for the succeeding four years.




     On February 6, 1997,  the Company issued $125.0  million  principal  amount
6.75% notes due February 1, 2027 under the Company's  medium-term  note program.
The notes were priced at 99.78%,  to yield 6.78% to maturity.  The notes are not
redeemable prior to maturity and have no sinking fund requirements.  Each holder
of the notes has the right to require the Company to repay such holder's  notes,
in whole or in part,  on  February 1, 2007.  The Company  intends to use the net
proceeds  from the sale of the notes for general  corporate  purposes  which may
include  repayment  of debt,  acquisitions,  and  loans and  advances  to and/or
investments in  subsidiaries  of the Company for working  capital,  repayment of
debt and capital expenditures.

Note 7.  Common Stock
     The Company's 1993 Stock and Long-Term  Incentive Plan (1993 Plan) provides
for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards: (1) stock options,
including  incentive stock options and  non-qualified  stock options;  (2) stock
appreciation  rights,  in  tandem  with  stock  options  or  freestanding;   (3)
restricted stock; (4) performance  share awards;  and (5) stock value equivalent
awards.  Under the terms of the 1993 Plan,  5.5 million  shares of the Company's
Common Stock were reserved for issuance to key employees.  At December 31, 1996,
0.3 million  shares were  available  for future  grants under the 1993 Plan.  In
connection with the acquisition of Landmark,  the stock option plans  maintained
by Landmark were assumed by the Company.  Stock option  transactions  summarized
below  include  amounts  for the 1993  Plan and the  Landmark  plans  using  the
acquisition exchange rate of .574 shares for each Landmark share.


     Options outstanding at December 31, 1996 is composed of the following:




     All stock  options under the 1993 Plan are granted at the fair market value
of the Common Stock at the grant date. Landmark, prior to its acquisition by the
Company,  had  provisions  in its plans  that  allowed  Landmark  to set  option
exercise prices at a defined  percentage  below fair market value.  The weighted
average fair value of the stock options granted during 1996 was $20.48. The fair
value of each stock  option  grant is  estimated  on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes   option  pricing  model  with  the  following   weighted  average
assumptions used for grants in 1996:  risk-free interest rate of 5.9%;  expected
dividend yield of 1.6%;  expected life of five years; and expected volatility of
39.72%. The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during 1995
was $14.32. The following  weighted average  assumptions were used for grants in
1995: risk-free interest rate of 6.2%; expected dividend yield of 1.6%; expected
life of five years; and expected  volatility of 38.36%.  Stock options generally
expire ten years  from the grant  date.  Stock  options  vest over a  three-year
period, with one-third of the shares becoming  exercisable on each of the first,
second and third anniversaries of the grant date.
     The  Company  accounts  for the 1993  Plan in  accordance  with  Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25,  under which no  compensation  cost has been
recognized for stock option awards. Had compensation cost for the 1993 Plan been
determined  consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock - Based  Compensation" (SFAS 123), the Company's pro forma
net income for 1996 and 1995 would have been $292.4 million and $181.6  million,
respectively,  resulting in earnings per share of $2.32 and $1.45, respectively.
Because  the SFAS 123  method of  accounting  has not been  applied  to  options
granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma  compensation cost may
not be representative of that to be expected in future years.
     Restricted  shares awarded under the 1993 Plan for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were
90,450,  206,350  and  80,600,  respectively.  The  shares  awarded  are  net of
forfeitures  of  11,750,  4,900  and  5,000  shares  in  1996,  1995  and  1994,
respectively.  The  weighted  average fair market value per share at the date of
grant of shares granted in 1996 and 1995 was $54.73 and $40.88, respectively.
     The Company's Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee  Directors (Restricted
Stock Plan) allows for each non-employee  director to receive an annual award of
200  restricted  shares of Common Stock as a part of  compensation.  The Company
reserved 50,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to  non-employee  directors.
The Company issued 1,800,  1,600 and 1,800  restricted  shares in 1996, 1995 and
1994,  respectively  under this plan. The weighted average fair market value per
share at the date of grant of shares  granted  in 1996 and 1995 was  $53.13  and
$40.75, respectively.
     The  Company's  Employees'   Restricted  Stock  Plan  was  established  for
employees  who are not officers,  for which 100,000  shares of Common Stock have
been reserved.  The Company awarded 1,750 and 96,750  restricted  shares in 1995
and 1994,  respectively,  and 4,200 and 900 restricted  shares were forfeited in
1996 and 1995,  respectively.  No awards were made in 1996 and no further grants
are being made under this plan. The weighted average fair market value per share
at the date of grant for shares granted in 1995 was $35.00.
     Under the terms of the Company's Career Executive Incentive Stock Plan, 7.5
million  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock were  reserved  for issuance to
officers and key employees at a purchase  price not to exceed par value of $2.50
per share.  At December 31, 1996,  5.9 million shares (net of 1.0 million shares
forfeited) have been issued under the plan. No further grants will be made under
the Career Executive Incentive Stock Plan.
     Restricted  shares  issued  under the 1993  Plan,  Restricted  Stock  Plan,
Employees'  Restricted Stock Plan and the Career Executive  Incentive Stock Plan
are  limited  as  to  sale  or  disposition  with  such   restrictions   lapsing
periodically  over an  extended  period of time.  The fair  market  value of the
stock,  on the date of issuance,  is being amortized and charged to income (with
similar  credits to paid-in  capital in excess of par value)  generally over the
average  period  during  which  the  restrictions   lapse.   Compensation  costs
recognized in income for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $6.9 million, $7.0 million and
$7.1 million,  respectively.  At December 31, 1996,  the  unamortized  amount is
$22.9 million.

Note 8.  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
     The  Company has  previously  declared a dividend  of one  preferred  stock
purchase right (a Right) on each outstanding  share of Common Stock.  Each Right
entitles the holder thereof to buy one one-hundredth of a share of the Company's
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, at an exercise
price of $150, subject to certain antidilution  adjustments,  upon the terms and
subject to the  conditions set forth in the Rights  Agreement  entered into with
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. as Rights Agent. The Rights do not have
any voting rights and are not entitled to dividends.
     The Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances  involving a
potential business combination.  Following certain other events after the Rights
become  exercisable,  each Right will  entitle its holder to an amount of Common




Stock of the Company, or, in certain circumstances,  securities of the acquiror,
having a then-current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
The Rights are redeemable at the Company's option at any time before they become
exercisable.  The Rights  expire on December 15, 2005. No event during 1996 made
the Rights exercisable.

Note 9.  Business Segment Information
     In the fourth  quarter of 1996,  the  Company  realigned  its two  business
segments in order to better meet the growing  customer needs for complete arrays
of integrated energy services. Under the new structure, the upstream oil and gas
services  business  unit of the former  Engineering  and  Construction  Services
segment  and  Landmark,  a  leading  supplier  of  integrated   exploration  and
production  information  systems  and  professional  services  to the  petroleum
industry,  are included in the Energy Group.  The Energy Group also includes the
product and  service  lines of the former  Energy  Services  segment,  including
drilling systems and services,  pressure pumping equipment and services, logging
and perforating,  specialized  completion and production equipment and services,
and well control.  The Engineering and Construction Group provides  engineering,
construction,  project  management,  facilities  operation and maintenance,  and
environmental  services for industrial and governmental  customers.  Amounts for
prior years have been restated to conform to the new organization structure.
     The Company's  equity in income or losses of related  companies is included
in  revenues  and  operating  income of each  applicable  segment.  Intersegment
revenues included in the revenues of the other business segments are immaterial.
Sales between  geographic  areas and export sales are also  immaterial.  General
corporate  assets are primarily  comprised of cash and  equivalents  and certain
other investments.








Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
     Leases. At December 31, 1996, the Company was obligated under noncancelable
operating leases,  expiring on various dates to 2020, principally for the use of
land,  offices,  equipment and field  facilities.  Aggregate  rentals charged to
operations for such leases totaled $70.8 million in 1996,  $73.7 million in 1995
and $108.2 million in 1994. Future aggregate rentals on noncancelable  operating
leases are as follows:  1997, $55.7 million;  1998,  $41.2 million;  1999, $30.0
million;  2000,  $16.4 million;  2001,  $11.3  million;  and  thereafter,  $72.5
million.
     Environmental.  The Company is involved as a potentially  responsible party
(PRP) in  remedial  activities  to  clean up  various  "Superfund"  sites  under
applica    Federal law which imposes joint and several liability, if the harm is
indivisible,  on certain  persons  without regard to fault,  the legality of the
original  disposal,  or ownership of the site.  Although it is very difficult to
quantify the potential impact of compliance with environmental  protection laws,
management  of the Company  believes  that any  liability  of the  Company  with
respect to all but one of such sites will not have a material  adverse effect on
the  results of  operations  of the  Company.  With  respect to a site in Jasper
County,  Missouri (Jasper County Superfund Site), sufficient information has not
been developed to permit  management to make such a determination and management
believes the process of determining the nature and extent of remediation at this
site and the total costs thereof will be lengthy.  Brown & Root,  Inc.  (Brown &
Root), a subsidiary of the Company,  has been named as a PRP with respect to the
Jasper County Superfund Site by the  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). The
Jasper County  Superfund  Site includes  areas of mining  activity that occurred
from the 1800's through the mid 1950's in the southwestern  portion of Missouri.
The site  contains lead and zinc mine  tailings  produced from mining  activity.
Brown & Root is one of nine  participating  PRPs which have  agreed to perform a
Remedial  Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), which, due to various delays,
is not expected to be completed  until the fourth quarter of 1997.  Although the
entire Jasper County  Superfund Site comprises 237 square miles as listed on the
National  Priorities  List,  in the  RI/FS  scope  of  work,  the EPA  has  only
identified  seven areas,  or subsites,  within this area that need to be studied
and then possibly remediated by the PRPs. Additionally, the Administrative Order




on Consent for the RI/FS only requires Brown & Root to perform RI/FS work at one
of the subsites  within the site,  the Neck/Alba  subsite,  which only comprises
3.95  square  miles.  Brown &  Root's  share  of the cost of such a study is not
expected to be material.  At the present time Brown & Root cannot  determine the
extent  of its  liability,  if any,  for  remediation  costs  on any  reasonably
practica    basis.
     Other.  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal
proceedings.  Although the ultimate  dispositions  of such  proceedings  are not
presently  determinable,  in the opinion of the Company any  liability  that may
ensue will not be material in relation to the  consolidated  financial  position
and results of operations of the Company.

Note 11.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management
     Foreign  Exchange  Risk.  Techniques  in  managing  foreign  exchange  risk
include,  but are not limited to, foreign  currency  borrowing and investing and
the use of  currency  derivative  instruments.  The Company  hedges  significant
exposures  to potential  foreign  exchange  losses  considering  current  market
conditions,  future operating activities and the cost of hedging the exposure in
relation to the perceived  risk of loss.  The purpose of the  Company's  foreign
currency  hedging  activities  is to protect the Company  from the risk that the
eventual  dollar cash flows  resulting from the sale and purchase of products in
foreign  currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative  financial  instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.
     The  Company  hedges its  currency  exposure  through  the use of  currency
derivative instruments.  Such contracts generally have an expiration date of one
year or less. Forward exchange contracts (commitments to buy or sell a specified
amount of a foreign  currency at a specified  price and time) are generally used
to hedge  identifia     foreign  currency  commitments.  Gains or losses on such
contracts are deferred and recognized  when the offsetting  gains and losses are
recognized on the related hedged items.  Forward exchange  contracts and foreign
exchange option contracts  (which convey the right,  but not the obligation,  to
sell or buy a specified  amount of foreign  currency  at a specified  price) are
generally  used to hedge foreign  currency  commitments  with an  indeterminable
maturity date.  These  contracts are marked to market monthly with the resulting
gains or losses included in current period foreign exchange gains (losses). None
of the forward or option contracts are exchange traded.
     While  hedging  instruments  are  subject to  fluctuations  in value,  such
fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being
hedged.  The use of some  contracts may limit the  Company's  ability to benefit
from favora     fluctuations in foreign  exchange rates. The notional amounts of
open forward  contracts  and options were $161.1  million and $111.5  million at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The notional amounts of the Company's
foreign exchange  contracts do not generally  represent amounts exchanged by the
parties,  and thus,  are not a measure of the  exposure of the Company or of the
cash  requirements  relating  to these  contracts.  The  amounts  exchanged  are
calculated  by  reference  to the  notional  amounts  and by other  terms of the
derivatives,  such as exchange rates. The Company actively  monitors its foreign
currency exposure (net position) and adjusts the amounts hedged as appropriate.
     Exposures to certain  currencies  are generally not hedged due primarily to
the lack of availa    markets or cost  considerations  (non-traded  currencies).
The Company  attempts to manage its working capital position to minimize foreign
currency  commitments in non-traded  currencies and recognizes  that pricing for
the  services and products  offered in such  countries  should cover the cost of
exchange rate devaluations.  The Company has historically  incurred  transaction
losses  in  non-traded  currencies.  The  risk of loss is  primarily  due to the
magnitude of currency  devaluations  experienced in those currencies rather than
the size of the foreign currency exposures.
     Credit Risk. Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations  of credit risk are primarily cash  equivalents,  investments and
trade  receiva   s.  It is the Company's  practice to place its cash equivalents
and investments in high quality securities with various investment institutions.
The Company  derives the  majority of its  revenues  from sales and services to,
including  engineering and  construction  for, the energy  industry.  Within the
energy industry,  trade receiva   s are generated from a broad and diverse group
of customers.  There are  concentrations of receiva   s in the United States and
the United Kingdom. The Company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the
expected  collectibility  of  all  trade  accounts  receiva   .   There  are  no
significant  concentrations  of credit risk with any individual  counterparty or
groups  of  counterparties   related  to  the  Company's  derivative  contracts.
Counterparties are selected by the Company based on creditworthiness,  which the
Company  continually  monitors,  and on the  counterparties'  ability to perform
their  obligations  under the terms of the  transactions.  The Company  does not
expect  any  counterparties  to fail  to  meet  their  obligations  under  these
contracts  given their high credit  ratings and, as such,  considers  the credit
risk associated with its derivative contracts to be minimal.




     Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The estimated fair value of long-term
debt at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $229.6 and $247.9 million,  respectively,
as compared to the  carrying  amount of $200.0  million at December 31, 1996 and
1995.  The fair value of  long-term  debt is based on quoted  market  prices for
those or  similar  instruments.  The  carrying  amount of  short-term  financial
instruments  (cash and  equivalents,  receiva   s  and certain  liabilities)  as
reflected in the consolidated  balance sheets approximates fair value due to the
short  maturities of these  instruments.  The fair value of currency  derivative
instruments,  which generally  approximates the carrying  amount,  was   ss than
$2.5 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, based upon third party quotes.

Note 12.  Retirement Plans
     Retirement  Plans.  The Company has various  retirement plans which cover a
significant  number of its  employees.  The  major  pension  plans  are  defined
contribution  plans,  which  provide  pension  benefits  in return for  services
rendered,  provide an individual  account for each  participant,  and have terms
that specify how contributions to the participant's account are to be determined
rather  than the amount of  pension  benefits  the  participant  is to  receive.
Contributions  to these plans are based on pre-tax  income and/or  discretionary
amounts  determined  on an annual basis.  The Company's  expense for the defined
contribution  plans totaled $114.2  million,  $95.1 million and $98.7 million in
1996, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Other pension plans include defined benefit
plans,  which define an amount of pension  benefit to be provided,  usually as a
function of one or more factors such as age,  years of service or  compensation.
As a result of siza    reductions in the number of employees,  curtailment gains
of $1.3  million and $8.9  million are  reflected  in the net  amortization  and
deferral component of net periodic pension cost for 1995 and 1994, respectively.
These plans are funded to operate on an actuarially sound basis. Plan assets are
primarily  invested in equity and fixed income securities of entities  domiciled
in the country of the Plan's  operation.  Assumed  long-term  rates of return on
plan assets,  discount rates for  estimating  benefit  obligations  and rates of
compensation  increases  vary for the  different  plans  according  to the local
economic conditions. The rates used are as follows:


     The net periodic pension cost for defined benefit plans is as follows:








     The  reconciliation  of the funded  status for defined  benefit plans where
assets exceed accumulated benefits is as follows:


     The  reconciliation  of the funded  status for defined  benefit plans where
accumulated benefits exceed assets is as follows:

     Postretirement  Medical Plan. The Company offers a  postretirement  medical
plan to certain  employees that qualify for  retirement  and, on the last day of
active employment, are enrolled as participants in the Company's active employee
medical plan. The Company's  liability is limited to a fixed contribution amount
for each participant or dependent.  The plan  participants  share the total cost
for all benefits provided above the fixed Company contribution and participants'
contributions  are adjusted as required to cover benefit  payments.  The Company
has made no commitment to adjust the amount of its contributions; therefore, the
computed accumulated postretirement benefit obligation amount is not affected by
the expected  future  healthcare  cost  inflation  rate.  The  weighted  average
discount  rate  used  in  determining  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation was 7.75% in 1996, 7% in 1995 and 8% in 1994.

     Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following components:








     Postretirement  medical  benefits are funded by the Company when  incurred.
The Company's  postretirement  medical plan's funded status  reconciled with the
amounts  included in the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets at December 31,
1996 and 1995 is as follows:


Note 13.  Landmark Acquisition
     On October 4, 1996,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of Landmark
Graphics  Corporation  (Landmark) through the merger of Landmark with and into a
subsidiary of the Company,  the conversion of the  outstanding  Landmark  common
stock into an aggregate of approximately  10.2 million shares of Common Stock of
the Company and the assumption by the Company of the outstanding  Landmark stock
options  (for the  exercise of which the Company has  reserved an  aggregate  of
approximately  1.5 million  shares of Common Stock of the  Company).  The merger
qualified  as a tax free  exchange and was  accounted  for using the "pooling of
interests"  method of accounting  for business  combinations.  Accordingly,  the
Company's  financial  statements  have been  restated  to include the results of
Landmark for all periods presented.
     Prior to the merger,  Landmark had a fiscal  year-end of June 30.  Landmark
results have been  restated to conform  with  Halliburton's  calendar  year-end.
Combined  and  separate  results of  Halliburton  and  Landmark  during  periods
preceding the merger were as follows:



     Landmark,  together with its  subsidiaries,  designs,  markets and supports
sophisticated computer-aided exploration and computer-aided reservoir management
software and systems. Geologists,  geophysicists,  petrophysicists and engineers
in  more  than  70  countries  use  Landmark  products  in  exploration  for and
production of oil and gas.
     Landmark offers an extensive line of integrated  software  applications for
seismic   processing,    three   dimensional   and   two   dimensional   seismic
interpretation, geologic and petrophysical interpretation, mapping and modeling,
well log and production analysis,  drilling and production  engineering and data
management.  Through its service consulting business, Landmark provides software
training,  on-site  support and  assistance in designing  computer  networks and
integrating  applications and data. In addition to providing  software products,
Landmark  is a  value-added  reseller of  workstations  and other  hardware  and




provides  a range of  services,  including  software  and  systems  support  and
training,  systems  configuration  and  network  design  and  data  loading  and
management.

Note 14. Discontinued Operations
     On January 23,  1996,  the  Company  spun-off  its  property  and  casualty
insurance  subsidiary,  Highlands  Insurance Group,  Inc. (HIGI),  in a tax-free
distribution  to  holders of  Halliburton  Company  Common  Stock.  Each  common
shareholder of the Company  received one share of common stock of HIGI for every
ten shares of  Halliburton  Company  Common  Stock.  Approximately  11.4 million
common shares of HIGI were issued in conjunction with the spin-off.
     The following  summarizes  the results of  operations  of the  discontinued
operations:


     In the third  quarter of 1995,  HIGI  conducted an extensive  review of its
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to assess HIGI's reserve position. The
review  process  consisted  of gathering  new  information  and  refining  prior
estimates and primarily focused on assumed reinsurance and overall environmental
and asbestos exposure.  As a result of such review,  HIGI increased its reserves
for loss and loss adjustment  expenses and certain legal matters and the Company
also recognized the estimated  expenses related to the spin-off  transaction and
additional compensation costs and other regulatory and legal provisions directly
associated  with  discontinuing  the  insurance  services  business  segment  as
follows:


     The review of the insurance  policies and reinsurance  agreements was based
upon an actuarial  study and HIGI  management's  best estimates  using facts and
trends currently known,  taking into  consideration the current  legislative and
legal  environment.  Developed  case law and adequate claim history do not exist
for  such  claims.   Estimates  of  the  liability  were  reviewed  and  updated
continually.  Due to the  significant  uncertainties  related to these  types of
claims,  past  claim  experience  may  not be  representative  of  future  claim
experience.
     The Company  also  realized a valuation  allowance  for deferred tax assets
primarily  related to HIGI's  insurance  claim loss  reserves.  The  Company had
provided a valuation  allowance  for all temporary  differences  related to HIGI
based upon its intent announced in 1992 that it was pursuing the sale of HIGI. A
taxable  transaction  would have made it more  likely  than not that the related
benefit or future deductibility would not be realized.  The spin-off transaction
was  tax-free  and  allows  HIGI to  retain  its tax  basis and the value of its
deferred tax asset.

Note 15.  Acquisitions and Dispositions
     See Note 13 regarding the acquisition of Landmark.
     See Note 14 regarding the disposition of the Company's insurance segment.




     In the second quarter of 1996, M-I Drilling Fluids Company,  L.L.C.,  a 36%
owned joint venture,  purchased Anchor Drilling  Fluids.  The Company's share of
the  purchase  price was $41.3  million and is included in cash flows from other
investing activities.
     In 1995,  Landmark  acquired  two  software  companies  for a total of $5.8
million and 0.6 million  shares of its common  stock,  equivalent to 0.3 million
shares of  Halliburton  Company  Common Stock.  In 1994,  Landmark  acquired two
software  companies for a total of $13.3  million and 0.4 million  shares of its
common stock,  equivalent to 0.2 million  shares of  Halliburton  Company Common

Stock.
     The Company sold its natural gas compression business unit in November 1994
for  $205.0  million  in cash.  The sale  resulted  in a pretax  gain of  $102.0
million,  or 52 cents per share after tax.  The  business  unit sold,  owned and
operated a large  natural gas  compressor  rental fleet in the United States and
Canada.  The compressors  were used to assist in the production,  transportation
and storage of natural gas.
     On March 25, 1994,  Landmark issued 2.6 million shares of its common stock,
equivalent  to 1.5  million  shares of  Halliburton  Company  Common  Stock,  in
exchange  for  all of the  outstanding  common  shares  of  Advance  Geophysical
Corporation (Advance). Advance provides software which allows seismic processors
and  interpreters  to manipulate raw seismic data and to condense it into a form
that is ready for  interpretation.  The acquisition of Advance was accounted for
as a pooling of interests, and the financial statements for periods prior to the
Advance merger have been restated to reflect the financial  position and results
of operations of the combined companies.
     In January 1994,  the Company sold  substantially  all of the assets of its
geophysical services and products business to Western Atlas International,  Inc.
(Western  Atlas)  for  $190.0  million  in cash and  notes  subject  to  certain
adjustments.  The notes of $90.0 million were sold for cash in the first quarter
of 1994. In addition, the Company issued $73.8 million in notes to Western Atlas
to cover  some of the costs of  discontinuing  certain  geophysical  operations,
including the cost of personnel reductions, leases of geophysical marine vessels
and the closing of duplicate  facilities.  The final  payment on these notes was
made in February 1996.
     In January 1997, the Company  announced that it has offered to purchase all
of the  outstanding  shares of OGC  International  plc  (OGC) for  approximately
$117.9 million. OGC is engaged in providing a variety of engineering, operations
and  maintenance  services,  primarily  to the North Sea oil and gas  production
industry.  As of  February  28,  1997,  approximately  93% of such  shares  were
tendered to the Company and it is expected that the  acquisition  of all of such
shares will be completed in the second quarter of 1997.
     In February 1997, the Company announced that Devonport  Management  Limited
(DML),  which was 30% owned by the Company at December 31,  1996,  has agreed to
purchase Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited, which owns and operates the Devonport
Royal Dockyard in Plymouth,  England,  from the government of the United Kingdom
for  approximately  $66.1  million.  Concurrent  with the purchase,  the Company
increased its ownership of DML to 51%. The dockyard  principally provides repair
and  refitting  services for the British  Royal Navy's fleet of  submarines  and
surface ships.

Note 16.  Special Charges
     In September  1996,  the Company  recognized  special  charges to operating
income of $65.3 million ($42.7 million after tax) related to the  reorganization
of the Engineering and Construction Group, severance costs for combining general
support functions  throughout the Company,  and certain other business structure
costs, including $4.1 million ($3.5 million after tax) for costs associated with
the acquisition of Landmark.
     The Company recognized  severance costs of $41.0 million to provide for the
termination of approximately one thousand  employees  related to reorganization
efforts at the Engineering and  Construction  Group and plans to combine various
administrative  support functions into combined shared services for the Company.
The  terminations  impact  mostly  middle and senior  management  levels  within
business unit operations,  business unit support, and general and administrative
areas.  Approximately  $3.5  million  was  charged  against  the  reorganization
liability for the termination of  approximately  200 employees during the fourth
quarter of 1996. The remaining  terminations are to occur primarily during 1997.
The Company also recognized $20.2 million of costs associated with restructuring
certain  Engineering and  Construction  Group  businesses,  providing for excess
lease space and other items.
     The above charges to net income were offset by tax credits during the third
quarter  of  $43.7  million  due  to  the  recognition  of  net  operating  loss
carryforwards  and the settlement  during the quarter of various issues with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Company reached  agreement with the IRS and
recognized net operating loss  carryforwards  of $62.5 million ($22.5 million in
tax benefits) from the 1989 tax year. The net operating loss  carryforwards  are




expected to be utilized in the 1996 and 1997 tax years. In addition, the Company
also reached agreement with the IRS on issues related to intercompany pricing of
goods and  services  for the tax years 1989  through  1992 and  entered  into an
advanced  pricing  agreement for the tax years 1993 through 1998. As a result of
these  agreements  with the IRS,  the Company  recognized  tax benefits of $16.1
million.  The Company also recognized net operating loss  carryforwards of $14.0
million ($5.1 million in tax benefits) in certain foreign areas due to improving
profitability and restructuring of foreign operations.
     In September  1996,  Landmark also recorded  special charges related to the
merger with and into a subsidiary  of the Company of $8.3 million  ($7.6 million
after tax). In March 1996,  Landmark  recorded  special charges of $12.2 million
($8.7  million  after  tax)  for  the  write-off  of  in-process   research  and
development  activities  acquired in connection with the purchase by Landmark of
certain  assets and the  assumption  of  certain  liabilities  of Western  Atlas
International, Inc. and the write-off of redundant assets and activities.
     In 1995 and 1994,  Landmark  recorded  special  charges of $8.4 million and
$16.6 million,  respectively.  These amounts were primarily for the write-off of
research and  development  activities  of acquired  companies,  merger costs and
restructuring charges.
