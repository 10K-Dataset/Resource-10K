General
      description of business

Halliburton
      Company’s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
      the State of Delaware in 1924. Halliburton Company provides a variety of
      services, products, maintenance, engineering, and construction to energy,
      industrial, and governmental customers.

Our
      six
      business segments are: Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation, Digital and Consulting Solutions, Energy and Chemicals,
      and Government and Infrastructure. We refer to the combination of Production
      Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, and Digital
      and
      Consulting Solutions segments as our Energy Services Group (ESG).

Our
      Energy and Chemicals and Government and Infrastructure segments are part of
      KBR,
      Inc. (KBR), which was formed in March 2006. In November 2006, KBR, Inc.
      completed the initial public offering (IPO) of approximately 32 million shares
      of KBR, Inc. common stock at a price of $17.00 per share. We received proceeds
      of approximately $508 million from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and
      commissions and offering expenses. We currently hold an approximate 81% interest
      in KBR, Inc., which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. We are
      working toward the separation of KBR, Inc., which is expected to occur no later
      than the end of April 2007.

KBR’s
      Production Services operations were moved into discontinued operations for
      reporting purposes in the first quarter of 2006. All prior period amounts have
      been reclassified to discontinued operations.

Within
      the ESG during the second quarter of 2006, we moved slickline services, tubing
      conveyed perforating services and products, and underbalanced applications
      from
      the Production Optimization segment to the Drilling and Formation Evaluation
      segment, as these services are more closely aligned with the Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation segment. Prior period balances have been reclassified
      to
      reflect this change. Because of this change, what we previously referred to
      as
“logging services” within the Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment we now
      refer to as “wireline and perforating services.” In addition, for internal
      management purposes we combined our Drilling and Formation Evaluation and
      Digital and Consulting Solutions divisions, forming three Energy Services Group
      internal divisions. However, we continue to disclose four segments for the
      Energy Services Group.

See
      Note
      5 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about
      our
      business segments.

Description
      of services and products

We
      offer
      a broad suite of services and products through our six business segments. The
      following summarizes our services and products for each business
      segment.

ENERGY
      SERVICES GROUP

The
      ESG
      provides a wide range of services and products to customers for the exploration,
      development, and production of oil and gas. The ESG serves major, national,
      and
      independent oil and gas companies throughout the world.

Production
      Optimization

Our
      Production Optimization segment provides products and services for completion
      of
      wells, testing and monitoring performance of wells and reservoirs, and
      treatments to improve well productivity and increase recoverable reserves.
      This
      segment consists of production enhancement services and completion tools and
      services.

Production
      enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
      sand control services, and well intervention services. Stimulation services
      optimize oil and gas reservoir production through a variety of pressure pumping
      services, nitrogen services, and chemical processes, commonly known as hydraulic
      fracturing and acidizing. Pipeline process services include pipeline and
      facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping, chemical
      systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the midstream
      and downstream sectors of the energy business. Sand control services include
      fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the prevention of formation
      sand production. Well intervention services enable live well intervention and
      continuous pipe deployment capabilities through the use of hydraulic workover
      systems and coiled tubing tools and services.


Completion
      tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
      surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
      completion systems, expandable liner hanger systems, sand control systems,
      well
      servicing tools, and reservoir performance services. Reservoir performance
      services include testing tools, real-time reservoir analysis, and data
      acquisition services. Additionally, completion tools and services include
      WellDynamics, an intelligent well completions joint venture, which we
      consolidate for accounting purposes.

Until
      January 2005 when it was sold, subsea operations conducted by Subsea 7, Inc.,
      of
      which we formerly owned 50%, were included in this segment. Subsea 7, Inc.
      was
      accounted for using the equity method.

Fluid
      Systems

Our
      Fluid
      Systems segment focuses on providing services and technologies to assist in
      the
      drilling and construction of oil and gas wells. This segment offers cementing
      and drilling fluids systems.

Cementing
      is the process used to bond the well and well casing while isolating fluid
      zones
      and maximizing wellbore stability. Cement and chemical additives are pumped
      to
      fill the space between the casing and the side of the wellbore. Our cementing
      service line also provides casing equipment.

Baroid
      Fluid Services provides drilling fluid systems, performance additives, solids
      control, and waste management services for oil and gas drilling, completion,
      and
      workover operations. In addition, Baroid Fluid Services sells products to a
      wide
      variety of industrial customers. Drilling fluids usually contain bentonite
      or
      barite in a water or oil base. Drilling fluids primarily improve wellbore
      stability and facilitate the transportation of cuttings from the bottom of
      a
      wellbore to the surface. Drilling fluids also help cool the drill bit, seal
      porous well formations, and assist in pressure control within a wellbore.
      Drilling fluids are often customized by onsite engineers to increase stability
      and enhance oil production.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

Our
      Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment is primarily involved in the drilling
      and formation evaluation process during bore-hole construction. Services and
      products offered in this segment include, drilling systems and services, drill
      bits, and wireline and perforating services.

Sperry
      Drilling Services provides drilling systems and services. These services include
      directional and horizontal drilling, measurement-while-drilling,
      logging-while-drilling, multilateral systems, underbalanced applications, and
      rig site information systems. Our drilling systems offer directional control
      while providing measurements about the characteristics of the drill string
      and
      geological formations while drilling directional wells. Real-time operating
      capabilities enable the monitoring of well progress and aid decision-making
      processes.

Security
      DBS Drill Bits provides roller cone rock bits, fixed cutter bits, and related
      downhole tools used in drilling oil and gas wells. In addition, coring services
      and equipment are provided to acquire cores of the formation drilled for
      evaluation.

Wireline
      and perforating services include open-hole wireline services, which provide
      information on formation evaluation such as resistivity, porosity, and density,
      rock mechanics, and fluid sampling. Cased-hole and slickline services are also
      offered, which provide cement bond evaluation, reservoir monitoring, pipe
      evaluation, pipe recovery, mechanical services, well intervention, and
      perforating.

Perforating
      services include tubing-conveyed perforating services and products.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

Our
      Digital and Consulting Solutions segment provides integrated exploration,
      drilling, and production software information systems, consulting services,
      real-time operations, and other integrated solutions.

Landmark
      is a supplier of integrated exploration, drilling, and production software
      information systems as well as professional and data management services for
      the
      upstream oil and gas industry. Landmark software transforms seismic, well log,
      and other data into detailed computer models of petroleum reservoirs. The models
      are used by our customers for business and technical decisions in exploration,
      development, and production activities. Data management services provide
      storage, browsing, and retrieval of exploration and petroleum data. The services
      and products offered by Landmark integrate data workflows and operational
      processes across disciplines, including geophysics, geology, drilling,
      engineering, production, economics, finance, corporate planning, and key
      partners and suppliers.


This
      segment also provides oilfield project management and integrated solutions
      to
      independent, integrated, and national oil companies. These offerings make use
      of
      all of our oilfield services, products, technologies, and project management
      capabilities to assist our customers in optimizing the value of their oil and
      gas assets.

Additionally,
      this segment holds direct and indirect investments in upstream oil and gas
      properties, primarily in the North America region, which leverage our
      technology, knowledge, and access to services and products.

KBR

KBR
      provides a wide range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers
      and government entities worldwide through two business segments, Energy and
      Chemicals and Government and Infrastructure. The nature of these two segments
      can result in a relatively small number of projects and joint ventures
      representing a substantial portion of operations. Following is a summary of
      KBR’s segments.

Energy
      and Chemicals

Our
      Energy and Chemicals segment designs and constructs energy and petrochemical
      projects, including large, technically complex projects in remote locations
      around the world. The Energy and Chemicals segment includes onshore oil and
      gas
      production facilities, offshore oil and gas production facilities, including
      platforms, floating production and subsea facilities, onshore and offshore
      pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids (GTL) gas monetization
      facilities, refineries, petrochemical plants (such as ethylene and propylene),
      and Syngas, primarily for fertilizer-related facilities. Energy and Chemicals
      provides a wide range of engineering, procurement, construction, and facility
      commissioning start-up services, as well as program and project management,
      consulting, and technology services.

Included
      in this segment are a number of joint ventures, including the TSKJ joint
      venture, which was formed to design and construct large scale projects in
      Nigeria. TSKJ’s members are Technip, SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands
      B.V., which is an affiliate of ENI SpA of Italy, JGC Corporation of Japan,
      and
      KBR, each of which owns 25%. TSKJ has completed five LNG production facilities
      on Bonny Island, Nigeria and is currently working on a sixth such facility.
      We
      account for this investment under the equity method.

Also
      included in this segment is M. W. Kellogg Limited (MWKL), which is a
      London-based joint venture that provides full engineering, procurement, and
      construction contractor services for LNG, GTL, and onshore oil and gas projects.
      MWKL is owned 55% by KBR and 45% by JGC Corporation. We consolidate MWKL for
      financial reporting purposes.

Brown
      & Root-Condor Spa (BRC), a joint venture with Sonatrach and another Algerian
      company, enhances our ability to operate in Algeria by providing access to
      local
      resources. BRC executes work for Algerian and international customers, including
      Sonatrach. BRC has built oil and gas production facilities and civil
      infrastructure projects, including hospitals and office buildings. KBR has
      a 49%
      interest in the joint venture. We account for this investment using the equity
      method of accounting. We have recently been notified by a joint venture partner
      in BRC that it wishes to dissolve the joint venture.

Government
      and Infrastructure

Our
      Government and Infrastructure segment delivers on-demand support services across
      the full military mission cycle from contingency logistics and field support
      to
      operations and maintenance on military bases. In the civil infrastructure
      market, we operate in diverse sectors, including transportation, waste and
      water
      treatment, and facilities maintenance. We provide program and project
      management, contingency logistics, operations and maintenance, construction
      management, engineering, and other services to military and civilian branches
      of
      governments and private customers worldwide. We currently provide these services
      in the Middle East to support our United States military deployments, as well
      as
      in other global locations where military personnel are stationed. A significant
      portion of the Government and Infrastructure segment’s current operations relate
      to the support of United States government operations in the Middle East. KBR
      is
      also the majority owner of Devonport Management Limited (DML), which owns and
      operates Devonport Royal Dockyard, Western Europe’s largest naval dockyard
      complex. The DML shipyard operations are primarily engaged in refueling nuclear
      submarines and performing maintenance on surface vessels for the United Kingdom
      Ministry of Defence (MoD), as well as limited commercial projects. DML is
      consolidated for financial reporting purposes.


As
      part
      of our infrastructure projects, we occasionally take an ownership interest
      in
      the constructed asset, with a view toward monetization of that ownership
      interest after the asset operates for some period and increases in
      value.

This
      segment includes our investment in the Alice Springs-Darwin railroad (ASD).
      ASD
      is a privately financed project that was formed in 2001 to build and operate
      the
      railroad from Alice Springs to Darwin, Australia. ASD has been granted a 50-year
      concession period by the Australian government. KBR provided engineering,
      procurement, and construction services for ASD and is the largest equity holder
      in the project with a 36.7% interest, with the remaining equity held by eleven
      other participants. We account for this investment under the equity
      method.

Also
      included in this segment is Aspire Defence/Allenby-Connaught, a joint venture
      between us, Mowlem Plc. and a financial investor formed to contract with the
      MoD
      to upgrade and service certain United Kingdom military facilities. In addition
      to a package of ongoing services to be delivered over 35 years, the project
      includes a nine-year construction program. KBR indirectly owns a 45% interest
      in
      Aspire Defence, the project company that is the holder of the 35-year concession
      contract. In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in each of the two joint ventures
      that provide the construction and related support services to Aspire Defence.
      We
      account for this investment using the equity method of accounting.

Acquisitions
      and dispositions

In
      January 2007, we acquired all of the intellectual property, current assets,
      and
      existing business associated with Calgary-based Ultraline Services Corporation,
      a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp., for approximately $177 million,
      subject to adjustment for working capital purposes. Ultraline is a provider
      of
      wireline services in Canada. Ultraline will be reported in our Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation segment.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of KBR’s Production Services
      group, which was part of our Energy and Chemicals segment. In connection with
      the sale, we received net proceeds of $265 million. The sale of Production
      Services resulted in an adjusted pretax gain, net of post-closing adjustments,
      of approximately $120 million, which is reflected in discontinued
      operations.

Business
      strategy

Our
      business strategy is to maintain global leadership in providing energy services
      and products. Our ability to be a global leader depends on meeting four key
      goals:

-

establishing
                and maintaining technological
                leadership;

-

achieving
                and continuing operational
                excellence;

-

creating
                and continuing innovative business relationships;
                and

-

preserving
                a dynamic workforce.

In
      November 2006, KBR, Inc. completed an IPO, in which it sold approximately 32
      million shares of KBR, Inc. common stock, at $17.00 per share. We received
      proceeds of approximately $508 million from the IPO, net of underwriting
      discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As the IPO was a result of
      a
      broader corporate reorganization, the increase in the carrying amount of our
      investment in KBR, Inc. was recorded in “Paid-in capital in excess of par value”
on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. We now hold an
      approximate 81% interest in KBR, Inc., represented by 135.6 million shares
      of
      KBR, Inc. common stock, and consolidate KBR, Inc. for financial reporting
      purposes.

We
      are
      now working toward the separation of KBR, Inc., which we expect to complete
      no
      later than the end of April 2007.

On
      February 26, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan under which we will
      dispose of our remaining interest in KBR, Inc. through a tax-free exchange
      with
      Halliburton shareholders pursuant to an exchange offer and, following the
      completion or termination of the exchange offer, a special pro rata dividend
      distribution of any and all of our remaining KBR, Inc. shares. In connection
      with the anticipated exchange offer, KBR, Inc. will file with the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect
      to
      the offering, and we will file with the SEC a Schedule TO. The exchange offer
      will be conditioned on a minimum number of shares being tendered. Any exchange
      of KBR, Inc. stock for outstanding shares of Halliburton Company common


stock
      pursuant to the exchange offer will be registered under the Securities Act
      of
      1933, and such shares of common stock will only be offered and sold by means
      of
      a prospectus. This annual report does not constitute an offer to sell or the
      solicitation of any offer to buy any securities of KBR, Inc. The exchange offer
      and any subsequent spin-off will complete the separation of KBR, Inc. from
      Halliburton and will result in two independent companies. In January 2007,
      we
      received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, among other things,
      no
      gain or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a result
      of a distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of a pro rata dividend. We have
      requested a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that no gain
      or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a result of
      a
      distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of an exchange offer whereby holders
      of
      Halliburton stock may tender their shares and receive KBR, Inc. shares in
      exchange, followed by a dividend distribution of any remaining shares of KBR,
      Inc. stock held by Halliburton to its shareholders. The exchange offer and
      any
      subsequent distribution of KBR, Inc. stock will not be conditioned on receipt
      of
      such a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. We have also
      obtained an opinion of counsel related to the tax-free nature of the exchange
      offer and any subsequent spin-off distribution.

Markets
      and competition

We
      are
      one of the world’s largest diversified energy services and engineering and
      construction services companies. Our services and products are sold in highly
      competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales
      of
      our services and products include:

-

price;

-

service
                delivery (including the ability to deliver services and products
                on an “as
                needed, where needed” basis);

-

health,
                safety, and environmental standards and
                practices;

-

service
                quality;

-

knowledge
                of the reservoir;

-

product
                quality;

-

warranty;
                and

-

technical
                proficiency.

We
      conduct business worldwide in about 100 countries. In 2006, based on the
      location of services provided and products sold, 32% of our consolidated revenue
      was from the United States and 19% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq,
      primarily related to our work for the United States Government. In 2005,

28%
      of
      our consolidated revenue was from the United States and 25% of our consolidated
      revenue was from Iraq, primarily related to our work for the United States
      Government.

In 2004,
      27% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq and 22% of our consolidated
      revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than
      10%
      of our consolidated revenue during these periods. See Note 5 to the consolidated
      financial statements for additional financial information about geographic
      operations in the last three years. Because the markets for our services and
      products are vast and cross numerous geographic lines, a meaningful estimate
      of
      the total number of competitors cannot be made. The industries we serve are
      highly competitive and we have many substantial competitors. Largely all of
      our
      services and products are marketed through our servicing and sales
      organizations.

Operations
      in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
      acts of terrorism, civil unrest, expropriation or other governmental actions,
      and exchange control and currency problems. Except for our government services
      work in Iraq discussed above, we believe the geographic diversification of
      our
      business activities reduces the risk that loss of operations in any one country
      would be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a
      whole.

Information
      regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration,
      and
      financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
      Financial Instrument Market Risk and in Note 17 to the consolidated financial
      statements.


Customers

Our
      revenue during the past three years was mainly derived from the sale of services
      and products to the energy industry, including 68% in 2006, 60% in 2005, and
      52%
      in 2004. Revenue from the United States Government, resulting primarily from
      work performed in the Middle East by our Government and Infrastructure segment,
      represented 26% of our 2006 consolidated revenue, 32% of our 2005 consolidated
      revenue, and 40% of our 2004 consolidated revenue. No other customer represented
      more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented.

Backlog

Backlog
      represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to realize in the future
      as a
      result of performing work under multi-period contracts that have been awarded
      us. Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting
      principles, and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable
      to
      the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog. Backlog
      may not be indicative of future operating results. Not all of our revenue is
      recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including the fact that some
      projects begin and end within a short-term period. Many contracts do not provide
      for a fixed amount of work to be performed and are subject to modification
      or
      termination by the customer. The termination or modification of any one or
      more
      sizeable contracts or the addition of other contracts may have a substantial
      and
      immediate effect on backlog.

We
      generally include total expected revenue in backlog when a contract is awarded
      and/or the scope is definitized. For our projects related to unconsolidated
      joint ventures, we have included in the table below our percentage ownership
      of
      the joint venture’s backlog. However, because these projects are accounted for
      under the equity method, only our share of future earnings from these projects
      will be recorded in our revenue. Our backlog for projects related to
      unconsolidated joint ventures in our continuing operations totaled $4.4 billion
      at December 31, 2006 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005. We also consolidate
      joint ventures which are majority-owned and controlled or are variable interest
      entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our backlog included in the
      table below for projects related to consolidated joint ventures with minority
      interest includes 100% of the backlog associated with those joint ventures
      and
      totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.6 billion at December 31,
      2005.

For
      long-term contracts, the amount included in backlog is limited to five years.
      In
      many instances, arrangements included in backlog are complex, nonrepetitive
      in
      nature, and may fluctuate depending on expected revenue and timing. Where
      contract duration is indefinite, projects included in backlog are limited to
      the
      estimated value of the amount of expected revenue within the following twelve
      months. Certain contracts provide maximum dollar limits, with actual
      authorization to perform work under the contract being agreed upon on a periodic
      basis with the customer. In these arrangements, only the amounts authorized
      are
      included in backlog. For projects where we act solely in a project management
      capacity, we only include our management fee revenue of each project in
      backlog.

Our

                31,
                2006 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Total backlog attributable
                to
                unfunded orders was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2006 and $1.8 billion

                December 31, 2005.

                which were sold and were accounted for as discontinued operations.
                Backlog for the Production Services operations was $1.2 billion as
                of
                December 31, 2005.

ESG
                backlog excludes contracts for recurring hardware and software maintenance
                and support services offered by
                Landmark.

We
      estimate that, at December 31, 2006, 52% of the Energy and Chemicals segment
      backlog and 64% of the Government and Infrastructure segment backlog will be
      completed within one year. As of December 31, 2006, 57% of total backlog related
      to cost-reimbursable contracts with the remaining 43% related to fixed-price
      contracts. For contracts that contain both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
      components, we characterize the entire contract based on the predominant
      component. We were awarded a task order for approximately $3.5 billion for
      our
      continued services in Iraq through September 2007 under the LogCAP III contract.
      As of December 31, 2006, our backlog under the LogCAP III contract was $3.0
      billion.

Raw
      materials

Raw
      materials essential to our business are normally readily available. Current
      market conditions have triggered constraints in the supply of certain raw
      materials, such as, sand, cement, and specialty metals. Given high activity
      levels, particularly in the United States, we are seeking ways to ensure the
      availability of resources, as well as manage the rising costs of raw materials.
      Our procurement department is using our size and buying power through several
      programs designed to ensure that we have access to key materials at competitive
      prices.

Research
      and development costs

We
      maintain an active research and development program. The program improves
      existing products and processes, develops new products and processes, and
      improves engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs
      of
      our customers. Our expenditures for research and development activities were
      $256 million in 2006, $220 million in 2005, and $234 million in 2004, of which
      over 97% was company-sponsored in each year.

Patents

We
      own a
      large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent
      applications covering various products and processes. We are also licensed
      to
      utilize patents owned by others. We do not consider any particular patent to
      be
      material to our business operations.


Seasonality

On
      an
      overall basis, our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. Weather
      and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services,
      but the widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate
      those effects. Examples of how weather can impact our business
      include:

-

the
                severity and duration of the winter in North America can have a
                significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for
                natural
                gas;

-

the
                timing and duration of the spring thaw in Canada directly affects
                activity
                levels due to road restrictions;

-

typhoons
                and hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations;
                and

-

severe
                weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity
                levels in the North Sea and Russia.

In
      addition, due to higher spending near the end of the year by customers for
      software, Landmark results of operations are generally stronger in the fourth
      quarter of the year than at the beginning of the year.

Employees

At
      December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 104,000 people worldwide compared
      to 100,000 at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, approximately 9% of
      our
      employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Based upon the
      geographic diversification of these employees, we believe any risk of loss
      from
      employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the
      conduct of our operations taken as a whole.

Environmental
      regulation

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.

In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations.

All
      of
      our owned properties are unencumbered.

In
      addition, we have 140 international and 100 United States field camps from
      which
      the ESG delivers its services and products. We also have numerous small
      facilities that include sales offices, project offices, and bulk storage
      facilities throughout the world. We own or lease marine fabrication facilities
      covering approximately 535 acres in England (primarily related to DML) and
      Scotland, which are used by KBR. Our marine facility located in Scotland is
      currently for sale.

We
      have
      mineral rights to proven and probable reserves of barite and bentonite. These
      rights include leaseholds, mining claims, and owned property. We process barite
      and bentonite for use in our Fluid Systems segment in addition to supplying
      many
      industrial markets worldwide. Based on the number of tons of bentonite consumed
      in fiscal year 2006, we estimate that our 18.6 million tons of proven reserves
      in areas of active mining are sufficient to fulfill our internal and external
      needs for the next 12 years. We estimate that our 3.8 million tons of proven
      reserves of barite in areas of active mining equate to a 15-year supply based
      on
      current rates of production. These estimates are subject to change based on
      periodic updates to reserve estimates, future consumption, mining economics,
      and
      changes in environmental legislation.

We
      believe all properties that we currently occupy are suitable for their intended
      use.

Halliburton
          Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Information
          related to the high and low market prices of common stock and quarterly
          dividend
          payments is included under the caption “Quarterly Data and Market Price
          Information” on page 128 of this annual report. Cash dividends on common
          stock in the amount of $0.075 for 2006 and $0.0625 for 2005 were paid in
          March,
          June, September, and December. Our Board of Directors intends to consider
          the
          payment of quarterly dividends on the outstanding shares of our common
          stock in
          the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends, however, will
          be at
          the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other
          things, future earnings, general financial condition and liquidity, success
          in
          business activities, capital requirements, and general business
          conditions.

The
          following graph and table compare total shareholder return on our common
          stock
          for the five-year period ending December 31, 2006, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Stock Index and the Standard & Poor’s Energy Composite Index over
          the same period. This comparison assumes the investment of $100 on December
          31,
          2001, and the reinvestment of all dividends. The shareholder return set
          forth is
          not necessarily indicative of future performance.

      controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
      disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated
      and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
      Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding

HALLIBURTON
      COMPANY

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

EXECUTIVE
      OVERVIEW

During
      2006, the Energy Services Group (ESG) produced revenue of $13.0 billion and
      operating income of $3.4 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 26.1%.
      Revenue increased $2.9 billion or 28% over 2005, primarily driven by higher
      activity in North America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and the North Sea.
      ESG
      operating income increased $1.1 billion or 48% compared to 2005.
      Internationally, ESG experienced 23% revenue growth and 44% operating income
      growth during 2006 compared to the prior year. Increased customer drilling
      and
      production activity, increased demand for our technologies, higher utilization
      of assets, and continued price increases have allowed us to produce record
      revenue and operating income throughout the year.

In
      2006,
      KBR revenue was down $519 million to $9.6 billion with operating income
      decreasing $214 million to $239 million compared to 2005. The revenue decline
      was primarily due to decreased military support activities in Iraq.

In
      August
      2006, we were awarded a $3.5 billion task order under our LogCAP III contract
      for additional work through 2007. Backlog related to the LogCAP III contract
      at
      December 31, 2006 was $3.0 billion. In 2006, Iraq-related work contributed
      $4.7
      billion to consolidated revenue and $166 million to consolidated operating
      income, resulting in a 3.5% margin before corporate costs and taxes. We were
      awarded $120 million in LogCAP award fees during 2006 as a result of our
      performance rating. During the almost five-year period we have worked under
      the
      LogCAP III contract, we have been awarded 64 “excellent” ratings out of 76 total
      ratings. We expect to complete all open task orders under our LogCAP III
      contract during the third quarter of 2007.

In
      August
      2006, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) issued a request for
      proposals on a new competitively bid, multiple service provider LogCAP IV
      contract to replace the current LogCAP III contract. We are currently the sole
      service provider under the LogCAP III contract and in October 2006, we submitted
      the final portion of our bid on the LogCAP IV contract. We expect that the
      contract will be awarded during the second quarter of 2007. Despite the award
      of
      the August 2006 task order under our LogCAP III contract, and the possibility
      of
      being awarded a portion of the LogCAP IV contract, we expect our overall volume
      of work to decline as our customer scales back the amount of services we
      provide. However, as a result of the recently announced surge of additional
      troops in Iraq, we expect the decline to occur more slowly than previously
      expected.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we identified a $148 million charge, before income
      taxes
      and minority interest, related to KBR’s consolidated 50%-owned gas-to-liquids
      (GTL) project in Escravos, Nigeria. This charge was primarily attributable
      to
      increases in the overall estimated cost to complete the project. The project
      experienced delays related to civil unrest and security on the Escravos River
      near the project site, with additional delays resulting from scope changes
      and
      engineering and construction modifications. As of September 30, 2006, we had
      approximately $269 million in unapproved change orders related to this project.
      In the fourth quarter of 2006, we reached agreement with the project owner
      to
      settle $264 million of these change orders. We recorded an additional $9 million
      loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to non-billable engineering services
      for the Escravos joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we have
      recorded $43 million of unapproved change orders, which primarily relates
      to additional cost increases on this project.

In
      May
      2006, we completed the sale of KBR’s Production Services group, which was part
      of our Energy and Chemicals segment. In connection with the sale, we received
      net proceeds of $265 million. The sale of Production Services resulted in a
      pretax gain, net of post-closing adjustments, of approximately $120
      million.

In
      2006,
      KBR recorded $58 million of impairment charges related to an investment in
      a
      railway joint venture in Australia. This joint venture has sustained losses
      since the railway commenced operations in early 2004 and violated the joint
      venture’s loan covenants by failing to make an interest and principal payment in
      October 2006. The write-down of our investment in this joint venture in the
      first and third quarters of 2006 resulted from decreases in anticipated freight
      volume, a slowdown in the planned expansion of the Port of Darwin, and the
      joint
      venture’s unsuccessful efforts to raise additional equity from third
      parties.


In
      April
      2006, KBR, Petrobras, and the project lenders agreed to technical and
      operational acceptance of the completed Barracuda and Caratinga production
      vessels. In March 2006, Petrobras submitted to arbitration a $220 million claim
      related to the Barracuda-Caratinga project. The submission claimed that certain
      subsea flowline bolts failed and that the replacement of these bolts was our
      responsibility. We disagree with the Petrobras claim since the bolts met
      Petrobras’ design specification, and we do not believe there is any basis for
      the amount claimed by Petrobras. We have examined possible solutions to the
      problem and determined the cost would not exceed $140 million. We are defending
      ourselves in the arbitration process and will pursue recovery of our costs
      associated with this defense.

Separation
      of KBR

In
      November 2006, KBR, Inc. completed an initial public offering (IPO), in which
      it
      sold approximately 32 million shares of KBR, Inc. common stock at $17.00 per
      share. We received proceeds of approximately $508 million from the IPO, net
      of
      underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As the IPO was
      a
      result of a broader corporate reorganization, the increase in the carrying
      amount of our investment in KBR, Inc. was recorded in “Paid-in capital in excess
      of par value” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. We now
      hold an approximate 81% interest in KBR, Inc., represented by 135.6 million
      shares of KBR, Inc. common stock, and consolidate KBR, Inc. for financial
      reporting purposes.

We
      entered into various agreements relating to the separation of KBR from us,
      including, among others, a master separation agreement, a registration rights
      agreement, a tax sharing agreement, transition services agreements, and an
      employee matters agreement. The master separation agreement provides for, among
      other things, KBR’s responsibility for liabilities related to its business and
      Halliburton’s responsibility for liabilities unrelated to KBR’s business.
      Halliburton provided indemnification in favor of KBR under the master separation
      agreement for contingent liabilities, including Halliburton’s indemnification of
      KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006,
      the date of the master separation agreement, for:

-

fines
                or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages, including
                disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a governmental
                authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Nigeria,
                Switzerland and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to alleged
                or
                actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the United
                States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or particular, analogous
                applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules and regulations in connection
                with current investigations, including with respect to the construction
                and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a natural gas liquefaction complex
                and
                related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria;
                and

-

all
                out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses, or cash settlements or cash
                arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after the effective
                date
                of the master separation agreement as a result of the replacement
                of the
                subsea flowline bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
                project.

The
      Halliburton performance guarantees and letter of credit guarantees that are
      currently in place in favor of KBR’s customers or lenders will continue after
      the separation of KBR until these guarantees expire at the earlier of: (1)
      the
      termination of the underlying project contract or KBR obligations thereunder
      or
      (2) the expiration of the relevant credit support instrument in accordance
      with
      its terms or release of such instrument by the customer. KBR will compensate
      Halliburton for these guarantees and indemnify Halliburton if Halliburton is
      required to perform under any of these guarantees. The tax sharing agreement
      provides for allocations of United States income tax liabilities and other
      agreements between us and KBR with respect to tax matters. Under the transition
      services agreements, we will continue to provide various interim corporate
      support services to KBR, and KBR continues to provide various interim corporate
      support services to us. The fees will be determined on a basis generally
      intended to approximate the fully allocated direct and indirect costs of
      providing the services, without any profit. Under an employee matters agreement,
      Halliburton and KBR have allocated liabilities and responsibilities related
      to
      current and former employees and their participation in certain benefit plans.
      KBR’s final prospectus for its initial public offering dated November 15, 2006
      contains a more detailed description of these separation
      agreements.


In
      conjunction with the closing of the KBR, Inc. IPO, KBR, Inc. granted stock
      options, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards under the KBR,
      Inc.
      2006 Stock and Incentive Plan. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial
      statements for further detail on KBR, Inc. stock incentive plans.

We
      are
      now working toward the separation of KBR, Inc., which we expect to complete
      no
      later than the end of April 2007.

On
      February 26, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan under which we will
      dispose of our remaining interest in KBR, Inc. through a tax-free exchange
      with
      Halliburton shareholders pursuant to an exchange offer and, following the
      completion or termination of the exchange offer, a special pro rata dividend
      distribution of any and all of our remaining KBR, Inc. shares. In connection
      with the anticipated exchange offer, KBR, Inc. will file with the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect
      to
      the offering, and we will file with the SEC a Schedule TO. The exchange offer
      will be conditioned on a minimum number of shares being tendered. Any exchange
      of KBR, Inc. stock for outstanding shares of Halliburton company stock pursuant
      to the exchange offer will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
      and
      such shares of common stock will only be offered and sold by means of a
      prospectus. This annual report does not constitute an offer to sell or the
      solicitation of any offer to buy any securities of KBR, Inc. The exchange offer
      and any subsequent spin-off will complete the separation of KBR, Inc. from
      Halliburton and will result in two independent companies. In January 2007,
      we
      received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, among other things,
      no
      gain or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a result
      of a distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of a pro rata dividend. We have
      requested a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that no gain
      or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a result of
      a
      distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of an exchange offer whereby holders
      of
      Halliburton stock may tender their shares and receive KBR, Inc. shares in
      exchange, followed by a dividend distribution of any remaining shares of KBR,
      Inc. stock held by Halliburton to its shareholders. The exchange offer and
      any
      subsequent distribution of KBR, Inc. stock will not be conditioned on receipt
      of
      such a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. We have also
      obtained an opinion of counsel related to the tax-free nature of the exchange
      offer and any subsequent spin-off distribution.

Other
      corporate matters

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly
      dividend to $0.075 per share, a 20% increase over prior quarters, and
      subsequently declared equivalent dividends during each quarter of 2006. This
      increase in the per share dividend amount contributed to an increase of
      approximately $50 million in our annual dividend payment over prior year. The
      Board of Directors also finalized the terms of a two-for-one common stock split,
      following the shareholder approval at the 2006 annual shareholders meeting
      of a
      proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from one
      billion shares to two billion shares. On July 14, 2006, each shareholder of
      record as of June 23, 2006, received one additional share for each outstanding
      share held. All periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the common
      stock
      split.

Also
      in
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of
      up
      to $1.0 billion. In September 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase
      to our existing common share repurchase program of up to an additional $2.0
      billion. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 40 million shares of our
      common stock for $1.3 billion or an average price per share of
      $32.93.

At
      December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition provisions of Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS No. 158), “Employers’ Accounting
      for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
      FASB
      Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” The adoption of SFAS No. 158 impacted
      our balance sheet at December 31, 2006 as follows: a decrease to total assets
      of
      $187 million, an increase to total liabilities of $157 million, a decrease
      to
      minority interest of $126 million, and a decrease to shareholders’ equity of
      $218 million.

In
      January 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
      (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), and began expensing the
      cost of our employee stock option awards and our employee stock purchase plan.
      On a pretax basis, these costs totaled approximately $41 million in 2006 and
      are
      in addition to $36 million in costs we have historically expensed related to
      other equity based compensation and $16 million of incremental compensation
      cost
      related to modifications of previously granted stock-based awards retained
      when
      certain employees left the company. All expense related to stock compensation
      awards were charged to the segments to which each affected employee is
      assigned.


Business
      outlook

The
      outlook for our business remains generally favorable. Worldwide demand for
      hydrocarbons continues to grow, and the reservoirs are becoming more complex.
      Despite some disruption in activity in late 2006 and early 2007 due to adverse
      weather conditions, at this time we continue to see steady demand for our
      services in North America. The future trend will depend on natural gas storage
      levels and the direction of natural gas prices. The Canadian market has softened
      significantly since mid-2006 with a decrease in year-end rig count of 21% as
      compared to 2005. If the slowdown in activity continues, we will adjust our
      allocation of capital in that market as necessary. Despite recent volatility
      of
      natural gas prices, we have been able to negotiate price increases, though
      not
      as high as in the previous two years, as contracts roll over. Finally, we expect
      the energy services sector in regions outside North America to grow. Therefore,
      we have been investing and will continue to invest in infrastructure, capital,
      and technology predominantly in the Eastern Hemisphere, consistent with our
      initiative to grow our operations in that part of the world. We expect to
      realize continued expansion in the Middle East, north Africa, offshore west
      Africa, and Russia.

In
      2007,
      we will focus on:

-

maintaining
                optimal utilization of our equipment and
                resources;

-

increasing
                pricing and reducing discounts, as the market allows, for ESG’s services
                and products;

-

leveraging
                our technologies to provide our customers with the ability to more
                efficiently drill and complete their wells and to increase their
                productivity.

To
                that end, we have plans for three international research and development
                centers with global technology and training
                missions;

-

expanding
                our manufacturing capability and capacity with new manufacturing
                plants;

-

hiring
                and training of additional personnel to meet the increased demand
                for our
                services;

-

pursuing
                strategic acquisitions in line with ESG’s core products and services to
                expand our portfolio in key geographic areas. Consistent with this
                objective, we acquired Ultraline Services Corporation, a provider
                of
                wireline services in Canada, in January
                2007;

-

increasing
                capital spending, primarily directed toward Eastern Hemisphere operations
                for service equipment additions and infrastructure related to recent
                project wins; and

-

completing
                the separation of KBR from
                Halliburton.

Detailed
      discussions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations and our
      liquidity and capital resources follow. Our operating performance is described
      in “Business Environment and Results of Operations” below.

Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into whether improper payments were made
      to
      government officials in Nigeria through the use of agents or subcontractors
      in
      connection with the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a
      multibillion dollar natural gas liquefaction complex and related facilities
      at
      Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related
      criminal investigation. The SEC has also issued subpoenas seeking information,
      which we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection
      with multiple projects, including current and prior projects, over the past
      years located both in and outside of Nigeria in which the Halliburton energy
      services business, The M.W. Kellogg Company, M.W. Kellogg Limited, Kellogg
      Brown
& Root or their or our joint ventures, are or were participants. In
      September 2006, the SEC requested that we enter into a tolling agreement with
      respect to its investigation. We anticipate that we will enter into an
      appropriate tolling agreement with the SEC.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem
      SpA of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (a
      subsidiary of ours and successor to The M.W. Kellogg Company), each of which
      had
      an approximately 25% interest in the venture at December 31, 2006. TSKJ and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and


Agip
      International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA of Italy). M.W. Kellogg Limited
      is a
      joint venture in which KBR had a 55% interest at December 31, 2006; and M.W.
      Kellogg Limited and The M.W. Kellogg Company were subsidiaries of Dresser
      Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries. The M.W. Kellogg
      Company was later merged with a subsidiary of ours to form Kellogg Brown &
Root, one of our subsidiaries.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the FCPA. In addition to performing our own investigation, we have been
      cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ investigations and with other
      investigations into the Bonny Island project in France, Nigeria and Switzerland.
      We also believe that the Serious Frauds Office in the United Kingdom is
      conducting an investigation relating to the Bonny Island project. Our Board
      of
      Directors has appointed a committee of independent directors to oversee and
      direct the FCPA investigations. Through our committee of independent directors,
      we will continue to oversee and direct the investigations, and KBR’s directors
      who are independent of us and KBR, acting as a committee of KBR’s Board of
      Directors, will monitor the continuing investigation directed by
      us.

The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries and continuing through the current time period). We have
      produced documents to the SEC and the DOJ both voluntarily and pursuant to
      company subpoenas from the files of numerous officers and employees of
      Halliburton and KBR, including current and former executives of Halliburton
      and
      KBR, and we are making our employees available to the SEC and the DOJ for
      interviews. In addition, we understand that the SEC has issued a subpoena to
      A.
      Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a consultant and chairman of KBR, and
      to
      others, including certain of our and KBR’s current and former employees, former
      executive officers of KBR, and at least one subcontractor of KBR. We further
      understand that the DOJ has issued subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining
      information abroad, and we understand that other partners in TSKJ have provided
      information to the DOJ and the SEC with respect to the investigations, either
      voluntarily or under subpoenas.

The
      SEC
      and DOJ investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ’s engagements of
      Tri-Star Investments as an agent and a Japanese trading company as a
      subcontractor to provide services to TSKJ were utilized to make improper
      payments to Nigerian government officials. In connection with the Bonny Island
      project, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements, including with
      Tri-Star Investments, of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal, commencing in
      and a series of subcontracts with a Japanese trading company commencing in
      1996.
      We understand that a French magistrate has officially placed Mr. Tesler under
      investigation for corruption of a foreign public official. In Nigeria, a
      legislative committee of the National Assembly and the Economic and Financial
      Crimes Commission, which is organized as part of the executive branch of the
      government, are also investigating these matters. Our representatives have
      met
      with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials. In October 2004,
      representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the Nigerian legislative
      committee.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements. In February 2005,
      TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not oppose the
      Attorney General’s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in accounts of
      Tri-Star Investments in banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria and to
      have
      the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian courts.

As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe that, based on the ongoing investigations,
      payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials. In
      addition, information uncovered in the summer of 2006 suggests that, prior
      to
      1998, plans may have been made by employees of The M.W. Kellogg Company to
      make
      payments to government officials in connection with the pursuit of a number
      of
      other projects in countries outside of Nigeria. We are reviewing a number of
      recently discovered documents related to KBR activities in countries outside
      of
      Nigeria with respect to agents for projects after 1998. Certain of the
      activities discussed in this paragraph involve current or former employees
      or persons who were or are consultants to us and our investigation
      continues.


In
      June
      2004, all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant and former
      employee of M.W. Kellogg Limited were terminated. The terminations occurred
      because of violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved
      the receipt of improper personal benefits from Mr. Tesler in connection with
      TSKJ’s construction of the Bonny Island project.

In
      2006,
      we suspended the services of another agent who, until such suspension, had
      worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several current projects and on numerous
      older projects going back to the early 1980s. The suspension will continue
      until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding the agent’s compliance
      with applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct. In addition,
      we suspended the services of an additional agent on a separate current
      Nigerian project with respect to which we have received from a joint venture
      partner on that project allegations of wrongful payments made by such
      agent.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement (if applicable) generally of profit, including
      prejudgment interest on such profits, causally connected to the violation,
      and
      injunctive relief. Criminal penalties could range up to the greater of $2
      million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the
      violation, which could be substantially greater than $2 million per violation.
      It is possible that both the SEC and the DOJ could assert that there have been
      multiple violations, which could lead to multiple fines. The amount of any
      fines
      or monetary penalties that could be assessed would depend on, among other
      factors, the findings regarding the amount, timing, nature, and scope of any
      improper payments, whether any such payments were authorized by or made with
      knowledge of us or our affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss
      involved, and the level of cooperation provided the government authorities
      during the investigations. Agreed dispositions of these types of violations
      also
      frequently result in an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the entity and the
      appointment of a monitor on terms negotiated with the SEC and the DOJ to review
      and monitor current and future business practices, including the retention
      of
      agents, with the goal of assuring compliance with the FCPA. Other potential
      consequences could be significant and include suspension or debarment of our
      ability to contract with governmental agencies of the United States and of
      foreign countries. During 2006, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $5.8 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. If necessary, we would seek
      to
      obtain administrative agreements or waivers from the DoD and other agencies
      to
      avoid suspension or debarment. In addition, we may be excluded from bidding
      on
      United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MoD) contracts in the United Kingdom if
      we
      are convicted for a corruption offense or if the MoD determines that our actions
      constituted grave misconduct. During 2006, KBR had revenue of approximately
      $1.0
      billion from its government contracts work with the MoD. Suspension or
      debarment from the government contracts business would have a material adverse
      effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

These
      investigations could also result in third-party claims against us, which may
      include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages,
      damage to our business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow,
      assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or business
      value, adverse consequences on our ability to obtain or continue financing
      for
      current or future projects or claims by directors, officers, employees,
      affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders
      or constituents of us or our subsidiaries. In this connection, we understand
      that the government of Nigeria gave notice in 2004 to the French magistrate
      of a
      civil claim as an injured party in that proceeding. We are not aware of any
      further developments with respect to this claim. In addition, we could incur
      costs and expenses for any monitor required by or agreed to with a governmental
      authority to review our continued compliance with FCPA law.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments relating to the Bonny Island
      project in Nigeria, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one
      or
      more competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such
      coordination possibly began as early as the mid-1980s.


On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Criminal prosecutions under applicable
      laws of relevant foreign jurisdictions and civil claims by, or relationship
      issues with customers, are also possible.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Possible
      Algerian investigation

We
      believe that an investigation by a magistrate or a public prosecutor in Algeria
      may be pending with respect to sole source contracts awarded to Brown & Root
      Condor Spa, a joint venture with Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd UK, Centre de
      Recherche Nuclear de Draria, and Holding Services para Petroliers Spa. KBR
      had a
      49% interest in this joint venture as of December 31, 2006.

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We
      ended
      2006 with cash and equivalents of $4.4 billion compared to $2.4 billion at
      December 31, 2005. We ended 2006 with a negative net debt-to-capitalization
      ratio, with cash and equivalents and short-term investments exceeding our total
      debt.

Significant
      sources of cash

Cash
      flows from operations contributed $3.7 billion to cash in 2006. In the second
      quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of KBR’s Production Services group, which
      was part of our Energy and Chemicals segment. In connection with the sale,
      we
      received net proceeds of $265 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we
      received approximately $76 million as part of two agreements to sell certain
      non-core assets, including several lift boats. Our working capital requirements
      for our Iraq-related work, excluding cash and equivalents, decreased from $495
      million at December 31, 2005 to $248 million at December 31, 2006.

We
      received proceeds of $508 million, net of underwriting fees and commissions
      and
      offering expenses, from the initial public offering of KBR, Inc. common stock
      in
      November 2006.

In
      and January 2007, we received $59 million in insurance proceeds related to
      fixed
      asset casualty reimbursement and business interruption from hurricanes Katrina
      and Rita.

We
      received approximately $167 million in asbestos- and silica-related insurance
      proceeds in 2006 and expect to receive additional amounts as
      follows:

Further
      available sources of cash.

We
      have
      available an unsecured $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility for
      general working capital purposes. There were no cash drawings under this credit
      facility as of December 31, 2006.


KBR
      has
      available an unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility. Letters
      of credit that totaled $55 million were issued under the KBR revolving credit
      facility, thus reducing the availability under the credit facility to
      approximately $795 million at December 31, 2006. There were no cash drawings
      under the facility as of December 31, 2006.

Significant
      uses of cash

Capital
      expenditures of $891 million in 2006 were 37% higher than in 2005. Capital
      spending in 2006 included $831 million related to ESG, of which $260 million
      related to non-North American operations. ESG capital expenditures included
      increased spending on pressure pumping and drilling equipment to accommodate
      higher activity levels. KBR capital spending in 2006 was $57 million and
      included spending related to our DML shipyard and the build-out of KBR’s
      enterprise resource planning system.

During
      2006, the company invested approximately $263 million on technology, including
      $256 million related to research and development costs.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of
      up
      to $1.0 billion. In September 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase
      to our existing common share repurchase program of up to an additional $2.0
      billion. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 40 million shares of our
      common stock for $1.3 billion, or an average price per share of $32.93. We
      paid
      $306 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2006.

We
      repurchased $41 million of debt at a total cost of $49 million in 2006. In
      the
      third quarter of 2006, we repaid, at par plus accrued interest, our $275 million
      6.0% medium-term notes that matured.

In
      2006,
      we contributed a total of $4 million to our domestic pension plans and $186
      million to our international pension plans, which included an ESG contribution
      of $58 million and a KBR contribution of $115 million to their respective United
      Kingdom pension plans.

Long-term
      debt includes a silica note contributed to the trust for the benefit of silica
      personal injury claimants. Subsequent to the initial payment of $15 million,
      the
      silica note provided that we would contribute an amount up to $15 million to
      the
      silica trust each year for 30 years. The note also provides for an extension
      of
      the note for 20 additional years under certain circumstances. We initially
      recorded the note at our estimated amount of approximately $24 million,
      including the initial payment of $15 million paid in January 2005. We will
      periodically reassess our valuation of this note based upon our projections
      of
      the amounts we believe we will be required to fund into the silica trust.
      Long-term debt also includes an asbestos insurance partitioning agreement that
      we reached in 2004 with Federal-Mogul, our insurance companies, and another
      party sharing in the insurance coverage to obtain their consent and support
      of a
      partitioning of the insurance policies. As part of the settlement, we agreed
      to
      pay $46 million in three annual installment payments beginning in January 2005.
      In 2004, we accrued $44 million, which represented the present value of the
      $46
      million to be paid. The discount is accreted as interest expense (classified
      as
      discontinued operations) over the life of the expected future cash
      payments.

Interest
      on debt includes 90 years of interest on $300 million of debentures at 7.6%
      interest which become due in 2096.


(3)

The
      purchase obligations disclosed above do not include purchase obligations that
      KBR enters into with its vendors in the normal course of business that support
      existing contracting arrangements with its customers. The purchase obligations
      with their vendors can span several years depending on the duration of the
      projects. In general, the costs associated with the purchase obligations are
      expensed as the revenue is earned on the related projects.

Capital
      spending for 2007 is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, of which $1.2
      billion relates to the ESG. In 2007, the largest increases in capital
      expenditures will be in the Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment and the
      Fluid Systems segment. From a geographic perspective, much of the increase
      in
      capital spending will be directed toward the Eastern Hemisphere to supply
      additional service equipment and infrastructure related to recent project wins.
      We expect our 2007 investment in technology to increase approximately 34%
      compared to 2006.

There
      are
      no debt maturities scheduled in 2007.

In
      future
      periods, we expect to make $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion annually in
      discretionary acquisitions in order to add to our energy service products and
      technologies. In January 2007, we acquired all of the intellectual property,
      current assets, and existing wireline services business associated with
      Ultraline Services Corporation, a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp.,
      for
      approximately $177 million subject to adjustments for working capital
      purposes.

We
      will
      also continue with our discretionary share repurchase program, which has $1.7
      billion of remaining authorization as of December 31, 2006.

Subject
      to board approval, we expect to pay dividends of approximately $75 million
      per
      quarter in 2007.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had commitments to fund approximately $156 million to
      related companies, including $119 million to fund our privately financed
      projects. These commitments arose primarily during the start-up of these
      entities or due to losses incurred by them. We expect approximately $13 million
      of the commitments to be paid during 2007.

Other
      factors affecting liquidity

KBR
      indemnifications.

We have
      entered into various agreements relating to the separation of KBR from us,
      including, among others, a master separation agreement, a registration rights
      agreement, a tax sharing agreement, transition services agreements, and an
      employee matters agreement. The master separation agreement provides for, among
      other things, KBR’s responsibility for liabilities related to its business and
      Halliburton’s responsibility for liabilities unrelated to KBR’s business.
      Halliburton provided indemnification in favor of KBR under the master separation
      agreement for contingent liabilities, including Halliburton’s indemnification of
      KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006
      the date of the master separation agreement, for:

-

fines
                or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages, including
                disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a governmental
                authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Nigeria,
                Switzerland and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to alleged
                or
                actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the FCPA
                or
                particular, analogous applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules, and
                regulations in connection with current investigations, including
                with
                respect to the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a
                natural
                gas liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in
                Rivers
                State, Nigeria; and

-

all
                out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses, or cash settlements or cash
                arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after the effective
                date
                of the master separation agreement as a result of the replacement
                of the
                subsea flowline bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
                project.

The
      Halliburton performance guarantees and letter of credit guarantees that are
      currently in place in favor of KBR’s customers or lenders will continue after
      the separation of KBR until these guarantees expire at the earlier of: (1)
      the
      termination of the underlying project contract or KBR obligations thereunder
      or
      (2) the expiration of the relevant credit support instrument in accordance
      with
      its terms or release of such instrument by the customer. KBR will compensate
      Halliburton for these guarantees and indemnify Halliburton if Halliburton is
      required to perform under any of these guarantees. The tax sharing agreement
      provides for allocations of United States income tax liabilities


and
      other
      agreements between us and KBR with respect to tax matters. Under the transition
      services agreements, we will continue to provide various interim corporate
      support services to KBR, and KBR continues to provide various interim corporate
      support services to us. The fees will be determined on a basis generally
      intended to approximate the fully allocated direct and indirect costs of
      providing the services, without any profit. Under an employee matters agreement,
      Halliburton and KBR have allocated liabilities and responsibilities related
      to
      current and former employees and their participation in certain benefit plans.
      KBR’s final prospectus for its initial public offering dated November 15, 2006
      contains a more detailed description of these separation
      agreements.

Letters
      of credit.

In the
      normal course of business, we have agreements with banks under which
      approximately $1.0 billion of letters of credit or bank guarantees were
      outstanding as of December 31, 2006, including $676 million that relate to
      KBR.
      These KBR letters of credit or bank guarantees include $516 million that relate
      to their joint ventures’ operations. Some of the outstanding letters of credit
      have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash
      collateralization.

Credit
      ratings.

Our
      current ratings are BBB+ on Standard & Poor’s and Baa1 on Moody’s Investors
      Service. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Moody’s revised its outlook from
“stable” to “positive” due to our progress in the KBR separation. In the second
      quarter of 2006, Standard & Poor’s revised its long-term senior unsecured
      debt rating from BBB to BBB+ with a “stable” outlook due to the significant
      improvement in ESG operating performance and the considerable reduction in
      debt
      over the past year. Our short-term credit and commercial paper ratings are
      A-2
      for Standard & Poor’s and P-2 for Moody’s Investors Service. We do not
      anticipate any adverse impact on our credit ratings resulting from the
      separation of KBR from Halliburton.

Debt
      covenants.

Letters
      of credit related to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility contain
      restrictive covenants, including maintaining a below maximum
      debt-to-capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with
      this requirement.

In
      addition, the unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility entered
      into by KBR contains covenants including a limitation on the amount KBR can
      invest in unconsolidated subsidiaries. KBR must also maintain financial ratios
      including a debt-to-capitalization ratio, a leverage ratio, and a fixed charge
      coverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, KBR was in compliance with these
      requirements.

Security.

In
      February 2007, we received a letter from the Department of the Army informing
      us
      of their intent to adjust payments under the LogCAP III contract associated
      with
      the cost incurred by the subcontractors to provide security to their employees.
      Based on this letter, the DCAA withheld the Army’s initial assessment of $20
      million. The Army based its assessment on one subcontract wherein, based on
      communications with the subcontractor, the Army estimated 6% of the total
      subcontract cost related to the private security costs. The Army indicated
      that
      not all task orders and subcontracts have been reviewed and that they may make
      additional adjustments. The Army indicated that, within 60 days, they intend
      to
      begin making further adjustments equal to 6% of prior and current subcontractor
      costs unless we can provide timely information sufficient to show that such
      action is not necessary to protect the government’s interest. We are working
      with the Army to provide the additional information they have
      requested.

The
      Army
      indicated that they believe our LogCAP III contract prohibits us from billing
      costs of privately acquired security. We believe that, while LogCAP III contract
      anticipates that the Army will provide force protection to KBR employees, it
      does not prohibit any of our subcontractors from using private security services
      to provide force protection to subcontractor personnel. In addition, a
      significant portion of our subcontracts are competitively bid lump sum or fixed
      price subcontracts. As a result, we do not receive details of the
      subcontractors’ cost estimate nor are we legally entitled to it. Accordingly, we
      believe that we are entitled to reimbursement by the Army for the cost of
      services provided by our subcontractors, even if they incurred costs for private
      force protection services. Therefore, we believe that the Army’s position
      that such costs are unallowable and that they are entitled to withhold amounts
      incurred for such costs is wrong as a matter of law.

If
      we are
      unable to demonstrate that such action by the Army is not necessary, a 6%
      suspension of all subcontractor costs incurred to date could result in suspended
      costs of approximately $400 million. The Army has asked us to provide
      information that addresses the use of armed security either directly or
      indirectly charged to LogCAP III. The actual costs associated with these
      activities cannot be accurately estimated at this time but we believe that
      they
      should be less than 6% of the total subcontractor costs. As of December 31,
      2006, no amounts have been accrued for suspended
      security billings.


BUSINESS
      ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We
      operate in approximately 100 countries throughout the world, where we provide
      a
      comprehensive range of discrete and integrated services and products to the
      energy industry and to other industrial and governmental customers. The majority
      of our consolidated revenue is derived from the sale of services and products
      to
      major, national, and independent oil and gas companies and governments around
      the world. The services and products provided to major, national, and
      independent oil and gas companies are used throughout the energy industry from
      the earliest phases of exploration, development, and production of oil and
      gas
      through refining and processing. Our six business segments are: Production
      Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and Formation Evaluation, Digital and
      Consulting Solutions, Energy and Chemicals, and Government and Infrastructure.
      We refer to the combination of Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions segments as
      the
      ESG, and the combination of Energy and Chemicals and Government and
      Infrastructure as KBR.

The
      industries we serve are highly competitive with many substantial competitors
      in
      each segment. In 2006, based upon the location of the services provided and
      products sold, 32% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States and
      19% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq. In 2005, 28% of our consolidated
      revenue was from the United States and 25% of our consolidated revenue was
      from
      Iraq. In 2004, 27% of our consolidated revenue was from Iraq and 22% of our
      consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted
      for
      more than 10% of our revenue during these periods.

Operations
      in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
      acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict,
      expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, exchange controls,
      or
      currency devaluation. Except for our government services work in Iraq discussed
      above, we believe the geographic diversification of our business activities
      reduces the risk that loss of operations in any one country would be material
      to
      our consolidated results of operations.

Halliburton
      Company

Activity
      levels within our business segments are significantly impacted by the
      following:

-

spending
                on upstream exploration, development, and production programs by
                major,
                national, and independent oil and gas
                companies;

-

capital
                expenditures for downstream refining, processing, petrochemical,
                gas
                monetization, and marketing facilities by major, national, and independent
                oil and gas companies; and

-

government
                spending levels.

Also
      impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil
      and gas consumption, demand for petrochemical products, and investment in
      infrastructure projects.

Energy
      Services Group

Some
      of
      the more significant barometers of current and future spending levels of oil
      and
      gas companies are oil and gas prices, the world economy, and global stability,
      which together drive worldwide drilling activity. Our ESG financial performance
      is significantly affected by oil and gas prices and worldwide rig activity,
      which are summarized in the following tables.

This
      table shows the average oil and gas prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI)

Heightened
      energy demand in 2006 contributed to a 13% increase in the average worldwide
      rig
      count compared to 2005. This increase was primarily driven by the United States
      rig count, which grew 19% year-over-year. Our ESG revenue in the United States
      grew 36% year-over-year with these rig count increases. Average Canadian rig
      counts increased 3% in 2006 compared to 2005. Outside of North America, average
      rig counts increased in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, with most
      of
      the increase related to oil drilling.

Our
      customers’ cash flows, in many instances, depend upon the revenue they generate
      from the sale of oil and gas. Higher oil and gas prices usually translate into
      higher exploration and production budgets. Higher prices also improve the
      economic attractiveness of marginal exploration areas. This promotes additional
      investment by our customers in the sector. The opposite is true for lower oil
      and gas prices.


United
      States oil prices experienced record highs in 2006 with WTI and Brent crude
      average yearly prices increasing 18% and 20% respectively, compared to
      2005.

After
      declining from record highs during the third and fourth quarter of 2006, crude
      oil prices are expected to remain at these historically high levels due to
      a
      combination of the following factors:

-

continued
                growth in worldwide petroleum demand, despite high oil
                prices;

-

projected
                production growth in non-Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
                (non-OPEC) supplies is not expected to accommodate world wide demand
                growth;

-

OPEC’s
                commitment to control production;
                and

-

modest
                increases in OPEC’s current and forecasted production
                capacity.

According
      to the International Energy Agency’s January 2007 Oil Market report, the outlook
      for world oil demand remains strong, with China, the Middle East, and North
      America accounting for approximately 78% of the expected demand growth in 2007.
      Excess oil production capacity is expected to remain constrained and that,
      along
      with steady demand, is expected to keep supplies tight. Thus, any unexpected
      supply disruption or change in demand could lead to fluctuating prices. The
      International Energy Agency forecasts world petroleum demand growth in 2007
      to
      increase 2% over 2006.

Volatility
      in natural gas prices has the potential to impact our customers' drilling and
      production activities, particularly in the United States. For example, mild
      temperatures and minimal hurricane-related disruptions to production on the
      Gulf
      of Mexico resulted in high natural gas storage levels and lower natural gas
      prices during the second half of 2006.

It
      is
      common practice in the United States oilfield services industry to sell services
      and products based on a price book and then apply discounts to the price book
      based upon a variety of factors. The discounts applied typically increase to
      partially offset price book increases. The discount applied normally decreases
      if activity levels are strong. During periods of reduced activity, discounts
      normally increase, reducing the revenue for our services and, conversely, during
      periods of higher activity, discounts normally decline resulting in revenue
      increasing for our services.

The
      price
      book increases we implemented in 2005 and the first half of 2006 increased
      revenue and operating income across all segments during 2006. From April 2006
      to
      July 2006, we implemented several United States price book increases ranging
      from 5% to 12%, led by our pressure pumping services. We will continue to
      evaluate future United States price book increases and focus on decreasing
      customer discounts.

Geographic
      discussion.

North
      America revenue for 2006 grew $1.6 billion compared to 2005. This growth was
      primarily led by our production enhancement services, where we help our
      customers optimize the production rates from the wells by providing stimulation
      services. Among the other opportunities we expect is the recovery in deepwater
      drilling. Although overall rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have continued to decrease
      in 2006, demand for rigs to drill in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico is
      increasing. Despite having downsized our Gulf of Mexico operations due to its
      downturn in 2002-2003, we continue to have a significant presence in the area
      and are positioned to meet increasing customer demand. As a result, our revenue
      from the Gulf of Mexico in 2006 was up 32% year-over-year, which contributed
      to
      a 152% increase in operating income in the Gulf of Mexico. Revenue from Canada
      was up 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by the Production Optimization
      segment. During the third quarter of 2006, our Drilling and Formation Evaluation
      and Fluid Systems segments were awarded multimillion-dollar contracts for a
      development project in Alaska.

During
      2006, our ESG international revenue increased 23% or $1.3 billion compared
      to
      2005.

In
      our
      Middle East/Asia region, Saudi Arabia experienced 49% revenue growth compared
      to
      2005 due to increased activity. In July 2006, we signed a three-year agreement
      to provide the oilfield services component for the Saudi Aramco Al Khurais
      project. In the Asia Pacific area, Malaysia and Australia contributed the most
      to year-over-year revenue growth compared to 2005. In the third quarter of
      2006,
      we were awarded two contracts in Indonesia totaling $110 million to provide
      cementing and stimulation services.


In
      our
      Europe/Africa/CIS region, North Sea activity has continued to grow, accounting
      for 25% of revenue growth year-over-year, led by the Production Optimization
      segment. In the second quarter of 2006, we signed a $193 million two-year
      contract with additional extension options for cementing services, pumping,
      and
      drilling and completion fluids in Norway. Also in the second quarter, we signed
      an estimated $100 million five-year contract with options for five single-year
      extensions to provide completion products and services for oil and gas
      operations in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, and Ireland. In
      July
      2006, we signed a $150 million contract to provide integrated drilling and
      well
      services in Norway for a duration of up to six years. Our operations in Russia
      experienced strong revenue and operating income growth year-over-year. In the
      fourth quarter of 2006, we signed a $59 million contract for the provision
      of
      hydraulic fracturing services in Russia. In the first quarter of 2007, we signed
      a $100 million three-year contract with options to renew for three additional
      one-year periods, for the provision of drilling fluids, waste management
      services, cementing, drill bits, directional drilling, and
      logging-while-drilling services in Russia. Activity in Africa grew $197 million,
      representing a 20% increase compared to 2005. Fluid Systems growth in both
      Nigeria and Angola, coupled with Production Optimization growth across Africa,
      accounted for the largest part of the revenue growth in Africa. We are
      continuing to deploy additional personnel into Libya as this market continues
      to
      grow after the elimination of sanctions by the United States.

In
      Latin
      America, we experienced 13% revenue growth year-over-year despite a decrease
      in
      revenue from Mexico. This came largely from revenue growth of 83% in Ecuador
      and
      29% in Columbia, both aided by the Fluid Systems contract start-ups that began
      in 2005. Double digit revenue growth in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela also
      contributed to the improvement in Latin America. The revenue decline in Mexico
      is mostly attributable to the turnkey drilling project, which began in 2004
      and
      was completed in July of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we signed a $73
      million three-year contract to provide stimulation services in
      Mexico.

Technology
      is an important aspect of our business, and we continue to focus on the
      development, introduction, and application of new technologies. Therefore,
      we
      expect our 2007 investment in technology to increase approximately 34% compared
      to 2006. We have plans for three international research and development centers
      with global technology and training missions. The first will open in Pune,
      India
      in the second quarter of 2007, and the second in Singapore is planned for later
      in 2007.

ESG
      also
      has plans on expanding its manufacturing capability and capacity with new
      manufacturing plants in Mexico and Brazil during the first half of 2007 and
      in
      Singapore and Malaysia during the second half of 2007.

ESG
      hired
      over 13,000 employees in 2006, and we expect to add a similar number in 2007.
      To
      meet the increasing need for technical training, we also plan to open a new
      training center in Tyumen, Russia in the first quarter of 2007, which follows
      recent training center expansions in Malaysia, Egypt, and Mexico.

KBR

KBR
      provides a wide range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers
      and government entities worldwide. At any given time, a relatively few number
      of
      projects and joint ventures represent a substantial part of our operations.
      KBR
      projects are generally longer term in nature than our ESG work and are impacted
      by more diverse drivers than short-term fluctuations in oil and gas prices
      and
      drilling activities, such as local economic cycles, introduction of new
      governmental regulation, and governmental outsourcing of services. Demand for
      KBR’s services depends primarily on its customers’ capital expenditures and
      budgets for construction and defense services. Additionally, the heightened
      focus on global security and major military force realignments, as well as
      a
      global expansion in government outsourcing, have all contributed to increased
      demand for KBR’s services.

Energy
      and Chemicals segment.

Our
      Energy and Chemicals segment designs and constructs energy and petrochemical
      projects throughout the world, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and GTL
      gas
      monetization facilities, refineries, petrochemical plants, offshore oil and
      gas
      production platforms, and Syngas facilities. Production companies are investing
      in development projects that may not have been economically viable when oil
      and
      gas price levels were lower than they are today. Our experience in providing
      engineering, design and construction services in the oil and gas industry
      positions us to benefit from the growth expected across the various oil and
      gas
      sectors. We are positioned to capitalize on the anticipated growth in LNG &
GTL infrastructure.


In
      order
      to meet growing energy demands, oil and gas companies are increasing their
      exploration, production, and transportation spending to increase production
      capacity and supply. KBR is currently targeting reimbursable EPC and
      engineering, procurement, and construction management opportunities in northern
      and western Africa, the Caspian area, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the
      North
      Sea. With regard to our energy and chemical projects, worldwide resource
      constraints, escalating material and equipment prices, and ongoing supply chain
      pricing pressures are causing delays in awards of and, in some cases,
      cancellations of major gas monetization and upstream prospects. Certain
      very large scale projects that KBR has been pursuing for new
      awards have either been cancelled, awarded to competitors
      or significantly delayed. These developments may negatively and materially
      impact KBR’s 2007 and 2008 results on a stand alone basis (excluding
      consideration of potential offsets such as the slower than expected decline
      in
      LogCAP III activity, or work in other areas and overhead reductions that may
      or
      may not be realized). It is generally very difficult to predict whether or
      when
      we will receive such awards as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy
      and
      complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors,
      such as market conditions, financing arrangements, governmental approvals and
      environmental matters.

Outsourcing
      of operations and maintenance work by industrial and energy companies has been
      increasing worldwide. Opportunities in this area are anticipated as the aging
      infrastructure in United States refineries and chemical plants requires more
      maintenance and repairs to minimize production downtime. More stringent industry
      safety standards and environmental regulations also lead to higher maintenance
      standards and costs.

In
      the
      first quarter of 2006, we signed a $400 million contract for the construction
      of
      the Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC) ammonia plant project.  We
      also have an investment in a development corporation that has an indirect
      interest in the EBIC project.  We are performing the EPC work for the
      project and operations and maintenance services for the facility. In August
      2006, the lenders providing the construction financing notified EBIC that it
      was
      in default of the terms of its debt agreement, which effectively prevented
      the
      project from making additional borrowings until such time as certain security
      interests in the ammonia plant assets related to the export facilities, could
      be
      perfected. Indebtedness under the debt agreement is non-recourse to us. This
      default was cured on December 8, 2006 subject to EBIC’s submission and the
      lender’s acceptance of the remaining documents by March 2007. No event of
      default has occurred pursuant to our EPC contract and we have been paid all
      amounts due from EBIC. In September 2006, we were instructed by EBIC to cease
      work on one location of the project on which the ammonia storage tanks were
      originally planned to be constructed due to a decision to relocate the tanks.
      The new location has been selected and the client and its lenders have agreed
      to
      compensate KBR for approximately $6 million in costs resulting from the
      relocation of the storage tanks. We resumed work on the ammonia tanks in
      February 2007.

In
      July
      2006, KBR was awarded, through a 50%-owned consolidated joint venture, a $997
      million contract with Qatar Shell GTL Limited to provide project management
      and
      cost-reimbursable engineering, procurement and construction management services
      for the Pearl GTL project in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project, which is expected
      to be completed by 2011, consists of gas production facilities and a GTL
      plant.

Also
      in
      July 2006, we were awarded a $194 million fixed-price engineering, procurement,
      and construction management contract by a Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Company
      for
      a 1.35 million ton-per-year ethylene plant in Jubail City, Saudi
      Arabia.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we identified a $148 million charge, before income
      taxes
      and minority interest, related to KBR’s consolidated 50%-owned GTL project in
      Escravos, Nigeria. This charge was primarily attributable to increases in the
      overall estimated cost to complete the project. The project, which was awarded
      in April 2005, has experienced delays relating to civil unrest and security
      on
      the Escravos River, near the project site. Further delays have resulted from
      scope changes, engineering and construction modifications due to necessary
      front-end engineering design changes and increases in procurement costs due
      to
      project delays. As of September 30, 2006, we had approximately $269 million
      in
      unapproved change orders related to this project. In the fourth quarter


of
      2006,
      we reached agreement with the project owner to settle $264 million of these
      change orders. As a result, portions of the remaining work now have a lower
      risk
      profile, particularly with respect to security and logistics. Since we completed
      our first check estimate in the second quarter of 2006, the project has
      continued to estimate significant additional cost increases. We currently expect
      to recover these recently identified cost increases through change orders.
      As of
      December 31, 2006, we have recorded $43 million of unapproved change orders
      which primarily relate to these cost increases. Because of the civil unrest
      and
      security issues that currently exist in Nigeria, uncertainty regarding soil
      conditions at the property site and other matters, we could experience
      substantial additional cost increases on the Escravos project in the future.
      We
      believe that future cost increases attributed to civil unrest, security matters
      and potential differences in actual rather than anticipated soil conditions
      should ultimately be recoverable through future change orders pursuant to the
      terms of our contract as amended in 2006. However, should this occur, there
      could be timing differences between the recognition of cost and recognition
      of
      offsetting potential recoveries from our client, if any. We recorded an
      additional $9 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to non-billable
      engineering services for the Escravos joint venture. These services were in
      excess of the contractual limit of total engineering costs each partner can
      bill
      to the joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, the project was approximately
      45%
      complete.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of KBR’s Production Services
      group. Under the terms of the agreement, we received net proceeds of $265
      million resulting in a pretax gain, net of post-closing adjustments, of $120
      million. As a result of the sale agreement, Production Services operations
      and
      assets and liabilities have been classified as discontinued operations for
      all
      periods presented.

Government
      and Infrastructure segment.

Our
      Government and Infrastructure segment provides support services to military
      and
      civilian branches of governments throughout the world, many of whom are
      increasing the use of outsourced service providers in order to focus on core
      functions and address budgetary constraints. The Government and Infrastructure
      segment’s most significant contract is the worldwide United States Army
      logistics contract, known as LogCAP III. We were awarded the competitively
      bid
      LogCAP III contract in December 2001 from the Army Materiel Command (AMC) to
      provide worldwide United States Army logistics services. The initial term of
      the
      contract was one-year, with nine one-year renewal options. We are currently
      in
      the fifth year of the contract.

In
      August
      2006, we were awarded a $3.5 billion task order under our LogCAP III contract
      for additional work through 2007. Backlog related to the LogCAP III contract
      at
      December 31, 2006 was $3.0 billion. In 2006, Iraq-related work contributed
      $4.7
      billion to consolidated revenue and $166 million to consolidated operating
      income, resulting in a 3.5% margin before corporate costs and taxes. We were
      awarded $120 million in LogCAP award fees during 2006 as a result of our
      performance rating. During the almost five-year period we have worked under
      the
      LogCAP III contract, we have been awarded 64 “excellent” ratings out of 76 total
      ratings. We expect to complete all open task orders under our LogCAP III
      contract during the third quarter of 2007.

In
      August
      2006, the DoD issued a request for proposals on a new competitively bid,
      multiple service provider LogCAP IV contract to replace the current LogCAP
      III
      contract. We are currently the sole service provider under the LogCAP III
      contract and in October 2006, we submitted the final portion of our bid on
      the
      LogCAP IV contract. We expect that the contract will be awarded during the
      second quarter of 2007. Despite the award of the August 2006 task order under
      our LogCAP III contract, and the possibility of being awarded a portion of
      the
      LogCAP IV contract, we expect our overall volume of work to decline as our
      customer scales back the amount of services we provide. However, as a result
      of
      the recently announced surge of additional troops in Iraq, we expect the decline
      to occur more slowly than previously expected.

In
      addition, KBR was awarded the competitively bid Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite
      Quantity contract in the first quarter of 2006 to support the Department of
      Homeland Security’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in the
      event of an emergency. With a maximum total value of $385 million, this contract
      has a five-year term, consisting of a one-year base period and four one-year
      renewal options.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, a $13.9 billion private finance initiative contract
      was
      signed with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence for the Allenby and Connaught
      project. This project is operated by a joint venture in which KBR has a 45%
      ownership interest. The project is for 35 years and consists of a nine-year
      construction


project
      to upgrade the British Army’s garrisons at Aldershot and the Salisbury Plain in
      the United Kingdom. The contract also includes provisions for additional
      services to be performed over the 35-year period, including catering,
      transportation, office services, and maintenance services.

In
      July
      2006, we resumed work under the U.S. Army Europe Support Contract, which was
      originally awarded in 2005. Under this contract, we will continue to provide
      support services to U.S. forces deployed in the Balkans. In addition, we will
      provide camp operations and maintenance, and transportation and maintenance
      services in support of troops throughout the U.S. Army Europe’s area of
      responsibility, which includes over 90 countries.

We
      are
      also the majority owner of Devonport Management Limited (DML), the owner and
      operator of Western Europe’s largest naval dockyard complex. Our DML shipyard
      operations are primarily engaged in refueling nuclear submarines and performing
      maintenance on surface vessels for the MoD as well as limited commercial
      projects. We are engaging in discussions with the MoD regarding KBR’s ownership
      in DML and the possibility of reducing or disposing of our interest. Although
      no
      decision has been made with respect to a disposition or reduction of our
      interest in DML, we are supporting a process to identify potential bidders
      that
      may have an interest in acquiring our interest in DML. We do not know at this
      time if the process will result in a disposition or reduction of our interest
      in
      DML.

With
      respect to the Alice Springs-Darwin railroad project, KBR owns a 36.7% interest
      in a joint venture that is the holder of a 50-year concession contract with
      the
      Australian government to operate and maintain the railway. We account for this
      investment using the equity method of accounting in our Government and
      Infrastructure segment. This joint venture has sustained losses since commencing
      operations due to lower than anticipated freight volume and a slowdown in the
      planned expansion of the Port of Darwin. At the end of the first quarter of
      2006, the joint venture’s revised financial forecast led us to record a $26
      million impairment charge. In October 2006, the joint venture incurred an event
      of default under its loan agreement by failing to make an interest and principal
      payment. These loans are non-recourse to us. In light of the default, the joint
      venture’s need for additional financing, and the realization that the joint
      venture efforts to raise additional equity from third parties were not
      successful, we recorded an additional $32 million impairment charge in the
      third
      quarter of 2006. We will receive no tax benefit as this impairment charge is
      not
      deductible for Australian tax purposes. In December 2006, the senior lenders
      agreed to waive existing defaults and concede certain rights under the existing
      indenture. Among these were a reduction in the joint venture’s debt service
      reserve and the relinquishment of the right to receive principal payments for
      months, through March 2009. In exchange for these concessions, the shareholders
      of the joint venture committed approximately $12 million of new subordinated
      financing, of which $6 million was committed by us. At December 31, 2006, our
      investment in this joint venture was $6 million. Our $6 million additional
      funding commitment was still outstanding.

In
      the
      civil infrastructure sector, there has been a general trend of historic
      under-investment. In particular, infrastructure related to the quality of water,
      wastewater, roads and transit, airports, and educational facilities has declined
      while demand for expanded and improved infrastructure continues to outpace
      funding. As a result, we expect increased opportunities for our engineering
      and
      construction services and for our privately financed project activities as
      our
      financing structures make us an attractive partner for state and local
      governments undertaking important infrastructure projects.

Contract
      structure.

Engineering and construction contracts can be broadly categorized as either
      cost-reimbursable or fixed-price, sometimes referred to as lump sum. Some
      contracts can involve both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
      elements.

Fixed-price
      contracts are for a fixed sum to cover all costs and any profit element for
      a
      defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us as we must
      predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs
      associated with executing the work. While fixed-price contracts involve greater
      risk, they also are potentially more profitable for the contractor, since the
      owner/customer pays a premium to transfer many risks to the
      contractor.

Cost-reimbursable
      contracts include contracts where the price is variable based upon our actual
      costs incurred for time and materials, or for variable quantities of work priced
      at defined unit rates. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be based upon
      a
      percentage of costs incurred and/or a fixed amount. Cost-reimbursable contracts
      are generally less risky, since the owner/customer retains many of the
      risks.

Note

-

All
      periods presented reflect the reclassification of KBR’s Production Services
      operations to discontinued operations, as well as the reorganization of tubing
      conveyed perforating, slickline, and underbalanced applications operations
      from
      Production Optimization into the Drilling and Formation Evaluation
      segment.

The
      increase in consolidated revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was attributable
      to
      increased revenue from our Energy Services Group, predominantly resulting from
      increased activity, higher utilization of our equipment, and increased pricing
      due to higher exploration and production spending by our customers. This was
      partially offset by reduced activity in our Government and Infrastructure
      segment, primarily in the Middle East. Revenue in 2005 was impacted by an
      estimated $80 million in lost revenue due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.
      International revenue was 68% of consolidated revenue in 2006 and 72% of
      consolidated revenue in 2005. Revenue from the United States Government for
      all
      geographic areas was approximately $5.8 billion or 26% of consolidated revenue
      in 2006, compared to $6.6 billion or 32% of consolidated revenue in
      2005.

The
      increase in consolidated operating income was primarily due to stronger
      performance in our Energy Services Group resulting from improved demand due
      to
      increased rig activity and improved pricing and asset utilization. KBR’s
      operating income declined primarily due to a $157 million loss recorded on
      the
      Escravos, Nigeria GTL project and reduced activity on government services
      projects, particularly in the Middle East. ESG operating income for 2006
      included a $48 million gain on the sale of lift boats in west Africa and the
      North Sea and $47 million of insurance proceeds for business interruptions
      resulting from the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. Operating income in 2005
      was
      adversely impacted by an estimated $50 million due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes,
      $45 million of which related to ESG and $5 million of which related to
      KBR.

In
      2006,
      Iraq-related work contributed approximately $4.7 billion to consolidated revenue
      and $166 million to consolidated operating income, a 3.5% margin before
      corporate costs and taxes.

Following
      is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable segment.

Production
      Optimization

increase
      in revenue compared to 2005 was derived from all regions. Production enhancement
      services revenue grew 36%, with improvements in all regions, largely driven
      by
      United States onshore operations due to strong demand for stimulation services,
      coupled with improved equipment utilization and pricing. Also contributing
      to
      production enhancement services revenue growth were improved pricing and
      equipment utilization in Canada, increased activity in Europe, and a new
      contract in Oman. Revenue from sales of completion tools increased 31% compared
      to 2005, with improvements in all regions, benefiting from improved completions
      and perforating sales in the United States and recovery of Gulf of Mexico
      activity. Additionally impacting the increase in sales of completion tools
      was
      the addition of Easywell to the completion tool portfolio in Europe and Asia
      and
      increased activity in Asia for WellDynamics. International revenue was 44%
      of
      total segment revenue in 2006 compared to 47% in 2005.

The
      Production Optimization segment operating income improvement spanned all
      regions. Production enhancement services operating income increased 59% largely
      due to improved product mix in the United States and Asia. A 41% improvement
      in
      completion tools operating income primarily resulted from increased sales in
      Asia and increased sand control tools activity in Brazil. Partially offsetting
      the improvements in completion tools was decreased activity in the Middle East
      for WellDynamics. The 2006 segment operating income was positively impacted
      by a
      $48 million gain on the sale of lift boats in west Africa and the North Sea.
      The
      Production Optimization segment received hurricane insurance proceeds of $12
      million in 2006. The 2005 segment operating income included a $110 million
      gain
      on the sale in 2005 of our equity interest in the Subsea 7, Inc. joint venture
      and was negatively impacted by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico by an estimated
      $14 million.

Fluid
      Systems

revenue
      increase compared to 2005 was driven by 27% growth in Baroid Fluid Services
      revenue and 26% growth in cementing services revenue. Both service lines
      increased primarily in the United States from improved pricing and increased
      activity. Baroid Fluid Services improvements spanned all regions with increased
      operations in Venezuela and Russia, new contracts in Norway and Nigeria, and
      increased activity in Angola and Sakhalin. The expiration of a contract in
      Indonesia partially offset Baroid Fluid Services revenue increase. Sales of
      cementing services also improved due to increased activity in Russia, the North
      Sea, and Nigeria, improved pricing and sales in Angola, and new contract
      start-ups and product sales in Asia Pacific. Partially offsetting the cementing
      services revenue increase was decreased activity in Mexico. International
      revenue was 52% of total segment revenue in 2006 compared to 55% in
      2005.


Fluid
      Systems segment operating income increase compared to 2005 resulted from 54%
      growth from Baroid Fluid Services and 43% growth in operating income from
      cementing services. Baroid Fluid Services operating income benefited primarily
      from increased activity and improved pricing in the United States and increased
      activity in Asia. Cementing services results increased predominantly in the
      United States due to increased activity and new contracts along with increased
      activity in Europe. The Fluid Systems segment received hurricane insurance
      proceeds of $31 million in 2006, and was negatively impacted by an estimated
      $25
      million in 2005 from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

revenue
      increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was derived from all four regions in all
      product service lines. The segment improvement was led by a 27% increase in
      drilling services revenue, particularly in the United States due to improved
      pricing and increased drilling activity. Increased international activity and
      new contract start-ups contributed to other region revenue increases, especially
      evident in Asia and Europe. Drill bits revenue increased 26% compared to 2005,
      largely benefiting from increased rig counts, improved pricing, and increased
      sales of fixed cutter bits in the United States and increased drilling activity
      in the Middle East and Asia. Wireline and perforating services revenue grew
      25%
      primarily due to increased activity and improved pricing in the United States
      land, new contract awards and increased cased hole activity in Asia, improved
      pricing in Latin America, and new contracts in the Middle East. Lower sales
      of
      logging equipment to Asia in 2006 partially offset the wireline and perforating
      services revenue improvement. International revenue was 71% of total segment
      revenue in 2006 compared to 72% in 2005.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation operating income increase compared to 2005 spanned
      all
      geographic regions in all product service lines, with the United States as
      the
      predominant contributor due to improved pricing and increased rig activity.
      Drilling services operating income increased 66% from 2005 on increased activity
      and new contracts in Europe and Asia. Drill bits operating income increased
      15%
      compared to 2005, the majority of which occurred in the Middle East and Asia.
      Wireline and perforating services results grew 50%, additionally benefiting
      from
      higher activity in the Middle East and Asia along with improved product mix
      in
      Latin America. Operating income in 2005 included a $24 million gain related
      to a
      patent infringement case settlement, while hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
      negatively impacted segment operating income by an estimated $6
      million.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

revenue
      increase in 2006 was driven by Landmark, with 17% revenue growth spanning all
      four regions, largely due to increased consulting services and software sales
      in
      Latin America and the United States. Project management revenue decreased 11%
      in
      2006 due to the completion of two fixed-price integrated solutions projects
      in
      southern Mexico. International revenue was 70% of total segment revenue in
      compared to 73% in 2005.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions operating income improved both at Landmark where
      operating income increased 59% due to stronger software and service sales,
      and
      project management where results tripled. The 2006 segment results included
      a
      gain of $10 million from the sale of an investment accounted for under the
      cost
      method and operating income of $12 million from earnings on an equity method
      investment. Included in 2005 segment results was $23 million in losses on two
      fixed-priced integrated solutions projects in Mexico and a $17 million favorable
      insurance settlement related to a pipe fabrication and laying project in the
      North Sea.

Energy
      and Chemicals

revenue
      for 2006 increased $365 million compared to 2005. The increase is due to the
      start-up of several projects awarded in 2005 or early 2006, including the
      front-end engineering and design work performed on the Pearl project and revenue
      earned on the Escravos GTL project, which increased $452 million. In addition,
      revenue from gas monetization projects in Yemen and Algeria increased $109
      million. These increases were offset by a $246 million decrease in revenue
      from
      a crude oil project in Canada.

Operating
      income for 2006 was $37 million compared to $124 million in 2005. The decrease
      is primarily due to a $157 million charge on the Escravos, Nigeria GTL project
      in 2006. The charge was primarily due to increases in the overall estimated
      cost
      to complete the project. The project has experienced delays relating to civil
      unrest and security on the Escravos River, near the project site. Also
      negatively impacting operating income were a charge on the Barracuda-Caratinga
      project and a decrease in operating income from the Belanak project totaling
      $30
      million. The decrease was partially offset by a $60 million increase in
      operating income from an ammonia project in Egypt and a gas development project
      in Algeria. In addition, we recorded $50 million of charges in 2005 related
      to
      an investment in an unconsolidated Algerian joint venture.


Government
      and Infrastructure

revenue
      for 2006 totaled $7.2 billion, an $884 million decrease compared to 2005. This
      decrease was primarily due to a $698 million decrease in revenue from
      Iraq-related activities, a $151 million decrease in revenue related to hurricane
      repair efforts for United States naval facilities under the CONCAP III contract,
      and $58 million of impairment charges related to an equity investment in an
      Australian railroad operation.

Operating
      income for 2006 was $202 million compared to $329 million in 2005, a $127
      million decrease. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by $58 million
      in impairment charges recorded on an equity investment in an Australian railroad
      operation and a $17 million impairment charge and loss recorded on an equity
      investment in a joint venture road project in the United Kingdom. These
      decreases were partially offset by a $24 million increase in operating income
      from DML shipyard operations. The 2005 results include $96 million in operating
      income from the sale of and one-time cash distribution from an interest in
      a
      United States toll road.

General
      corporate

expenses
      were $138 million in 2006 compared to $115 million in 2005. The increase was
      primarily due to increased legal costs and costs incurred for the separation
      of
      KBR from Halliburton.

NONOPERATING
      ITEMS

Interest
      expense

decreased $32 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the redemption
      in April 2005 of $500 million of our floating rate senior notes, the repayment
      in October 2005 of $300 million of our floating rate senior notes, and the
      repayment in August 2006 of $275 million of our medium-term notes.

Interest
      income

increased $98 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher cash investment
      balances.

Foreign
      currency losses, net

grew to
      $22 million in 2006 from $13 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due
      to
      the impact of United States dollar proceeds from the sale of Production Services
      that were received by our United Kingdom-based subsidiary, which uses British
      sterling as its functional currency.

Other,
      net

increased $14 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The 2005 year included costs
      related to our ESG accounts receivable securitization facility and sales of
      our
      United States government accounts receivable, neither of which had any
      outstanding amounts in 2006.

Provision
      for income taxes

from
      continuing operations in 2006 of $1.1 billion resulted in an effective tax
      rate
      of 33%. The lower tax rate of 3% for 2005 resulted from recording favorable
      adjustments in 2005 totaling $805 million to our valuation allowance against
      the
      deferred tax asset related to asbestos and silica liabilities. Our strong 2005
      earnings, coupled with an upward revision in our estimate of future domestic
      taxable income in 2006, drove these adjustments. We expect our 2007 tax rate
      to
      be approximately 35%.

Minority
      interest in net income of subsidiaries

decreased $23 million compared to 2005 primarily due to the loss from the
      consolidated 50%-owned GTL project in Escravos, Nigeria. This is partially
      offset by earnings growth in our DML Shipyard, M.W. Kellogg Ltd., and our Pearl
      GTL project and an immaterial amount related to approximately 19% of KBR, Inc.
      sold in the IPO in November 2006.

Income
      (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax

in 2006
      included a $120 million pretax gain on the sale of KBR’s Production Services
      group and $14 million of pretax income related to Production Services
      operations, partially offset by a $13 million legal settlement. Income from
      discontinued operations in 2005 primarily consisted of $45 million of pretax
      income related to Production Services operations.

Not
      Meaningful

Note

-

All
      periods presented reflect the reclassification of KBR’s Production Services
      operations to

discontinued operations,
      as
      well as the reorganization of tubing conveyed perforating, slickline,
      and

underbalanced applications operations from Production Optimization into the
      Drilling and Formation

Evaluation segment.

The
      increase in consolidated revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable
      to
      increased revenue from our Energy Services Group, predominantly resulting from
      increased activity, higher utilization of our equipment, and our ability to
      raise prices due to higher exploration and production spending by our customers.
      This was partially offset by reduced activity in our government services
      projects, primarily in the Middle East, the winding down of offshore fixed-price
      EPIC operations, and other oil and gas projects nearing completion.
      Additionally, $80 million in estimated revenue was lost during 2005 due to
      Gulf
      of Mexico hurricanes. International revenue was 72% of consolidated revenue
      in
      2005 and 78% of consolidated revenue in 2004, with the decrease primarily due
      to
      the decline of our government services projects abroad. Revenue from the United
      States Government for all geographic areas was approximately $6.6 billion or
      32%
      of consolidated revenue in 2005 compared to $8.0 billion or 40% of consolidated
      revenue in 2004.

The
      increase in consolidated operating income was primarily due to stronger
      performance in our Energy Services Group resulting from improved demand due
      to
      increased rig activity and improved pricing and asset utilization. KBR’s
      operating income increased primarily due to the resolution of disputed fuel
      costs and other issues as a result of favorable settlement of government audits,
      improved project execution, and savings from KBR’s restructuring plan. Partially
      offsetting the consolidated operating income increase was an estimated $50
      million adverse impact of Gulf of Mexico hurricanes in 2005, $45 million of
      which related to ESG and $5 million of which related to KBR.

In
      2005,
      Iraq-related work contributed approximately $5.4 billion to consolidated revenue
      and $172 million to consolidated operating income, a 3.2% margin before
      corporate costs and taxes.

Following
      is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable segment.

Production
      Optimization

increase
      in revenue compared to 2004 was derived from all regions. Production enhancement
      services revenue grew 37% largely driven by United States onshore operations
      due
      to strong demand for stimulation services coupled with improved equipment
      utilization and pricing. Higher rig activity in Canada and offshore Angola
      and
      increased equipment sales to China also contributed to production enhancement
      services revenue growth. Revenue from sales of completion tools increased 17%
      compared to 2004, benefiting from improved completions and perforating sales
      in
      Angola, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and increased perforating
      activity in southern Mexico. These improvements were partially offset by
      declines in the Caspian where completions, drill stem test, and reservoir
      information contracts concluded in 2004 and early 2005. WellDynamics, which
      is
      included in completion tools, revenue more than doubled in 2005 compared to
      due to a large contract for intelligent well completions in the Middle East.
      Our
      Subsea 7, Inc. joint venture, which was sold in January 2005, contributed $2
      million equity income in 2004. International revenue was 47% of total segment
      revenue in 2005 compared to 52% in 2004.

The
      increase in segment operating income in 2005 included a $110 million gain on
      the
      sale in 2005 of our equity interest in the Subsea 7, Inc. joint venture,
      partially offset by a $54 million gain on the sale of our surface well testing
      operations in 2004. The segment operating income improvement spanned all
      regions. Production enhancement services operating income increased 81% largely
      due to higher land rig activity and improved utilization of resources in the
      United States, as well as higher utilization of marine vessels offshore Angola.
      A 73% improvement in completion tools operating income primarily resulted from
      a
      general increase in sales and activity in the United States and higher
      completions and perforating activity in West Africa and the United Kingdom.
      WellDynamics had operating income in 2005 compared to a breakeven position
      in
      2004, primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and improved customer
      acceptance of its intelligent well completions technology. Subsea 7, Inc.
      contributed $2 million equity income to segment results in 2004. Hurricanes
      in
      the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 negatively impacted Production Optimization operating
      income by an estimated $14 million.


Fluid
      Systems

revenue
      increase compared to 2004 was driven by 24% growth in cementing services revenue
      and 21% growth in Baroid Fluid Services revenue. All geographic regions yielded
      increased revenue in both product service lines, with the largest increase
      in
      the United States due to higher onshore rig activity and higher deepwater rig
      activity in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as improved utilization and pricing.
      Sales of cementing services also improved due to increased activity in Canada
      and the North Sea and new contract start-ups in Indonesia. Baroid Fluid Services
      further benefited from increased activity in Angola, Indonesia, and the United
      Kingdom. International revenue was 55% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared
      to 58% in 2004.

Fluid
      Systems segment operating income increase compared to 2004 resulted from 62%
      growth from Baroid Fluid Services and 54% growth in operating income from
      cementing services. Baroid Fluid Services operating income benefited primarily
      from increased activity and improved pricing in the United States and increased
      activity and an improved product mix in Africa. Cementing services results
      increased predominantly in North America due to increased activity and improved
      pricing and asset utilization and in all other geographic regions due to
      generally higher global drilling activity. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
      in
      2005 negatively impacted Fluid Systems operating income by an estimated $25
      million.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation

revenue
      increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was derived from all four regions in every
      product service line. The segment improvement was led by a 30% increase in
      drilling services revenue, particularly in North America due to improved
      pricing, higher rig activity, and new contract awards. Increased international
      activity, new contract start-ups, and expanded GeoPilot® services contributed to
      other region revenue increases, especially evident in the North Sea, the Middle
      East, and Latin America. Drill bits revenue increased 26% compared to 2004,
      largely benefiting from increased rig counts, improved pricing, and increased
      sales of fixed cutter bits in the United States. Wireline and perforating
      services revenue grew 19% primarily due to increased cased hole activity and
      improved pricing in the United States, sales of logging equipment in Asia,
      and
      new contract awards in West Africa and the Middle East. International revenue
      was 72% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared to 73% in 2004.

The
      segment operating income increase compared to 2004 spanned all geographic
      regions in all product service lines, with North America as the predominant
      contributor due to improved pricing, increased rig activity, and growth in
      higher margin services. Drill bits operating income in 2005 was nearly five
      times that of 2004, the majority of which occurred in North America. Drilling
      services operating income more than doubled from 2004 to 2005, resulting from
      increased global activity, improved utilization and pricing, and continued
      customer acceptance of GeoPilot® and other high margin services. Equipment sales
      in Africa also contributed to drilling services operating income increase.
      Wireline and perforating services results grew 50%, additionally benefiting
      from
      higher activity in West Africa and the Middle East and sales of logging
      equipment in Asia. The increase in segment operating income included a $24
      million gain related to a patent infringement case settlement. Hurricanes in
      the
      Gulf of Mexico in 2005 negatively impacted Drilling and Formation Evaluation
      operating income by an estimated $6 million.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions

revenue
      increase in 2005 was largely driven by project management services, with 40%
      revenue growth due to increased activity in Mexico and higher commodity prices
      in the United States, partially offset by the winding down of projects in the
      Middle East and Russia. Landmark revenue increased 13% in 2005 due to data
      bank
      project growth primarily in Africa, increased consulting, and higher sales
      and
      services in Algeria, partially offset by nonrecurring sales to Asia in 2004.
      International revenue was 73% of total segment revenue in 2005 compared to
      69%
      in 2004.

The
      segment operating income improvement partially resulted from a 77% increase
      in
      Landmark operating income due to stronger software and service sales. Included
      in the 2005 results was a $17 million favorable insurance settlement related
      to
      a pipe fabrication and laying project in the North Sea. This was offset by
      $23
      million in losses in 2005 on two fixed-price integrated solutions projects
      in
      Mexico, reflecting increased costs to complete the projects and longer drilling
      times than originally anticipated, chiefly due to unfavorable geologic
      conditions. Operating income in 2004 included a $13 million release of legal
      liability accruals in excess of the Anglo-Dutch settlement, offset by $33
      million in losses on the fixed-price integrated solutions projects in Mexico
      and
      an $11 million charge for an intellectual property settlement.


Energy
      and Chemicals

revenue
      for 2005 decreased $482 million compared to 2004. Revenue from offshore EPIC
      projects decreased $205 million as these projects were substantially completed
      during 2005. Additionally, revenue from several older LNG and oil and gas
      projects in Africa and Australia and an olefins project in the United States
      collectively decreased $424 million as these projects were also completed or
      substantially completed in 2005. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher
      activity on an offshore engineering and management project in the Caspian and
      a
      crude oil facility project in Canada, totaling $76 million. Additional increases
      resulted from revenue earned on projects awarded in 2005 located in Australia,
      Indonesia, and Nigeria, totaling $220 million.

Operating
      income totaled $124 million in 2005 compared to a $443 million loss in 2004,
      a
      $567 million increase. Contributing to improved operating income in 2005 were
      stronger results on many projects, including joint venture gas projects in
      Nigeria, offshore engineering and project management projects in Angola and
      the
      Caspian, and recently awarded LNG and GTL projects, collectively totaling $44
      million. Additionally, 2005 results benefited from $21 million of gains on
      sales
      of assets and investments. Conversely, included in 2005 operating income were
      $30 million of losses on an Algerian gas processing plant project and $50
      million of charges related to an unconsolidated Algerian joint venture. Included
      in the 2004 results were a $407 million loss on the Barracuda-Caratinga project
      in Brazil, $47 million of losses on the same gas processing plant project in
      Algeria, $29 million of losses on the Belanak project in Indonesia, and
      restructuring charges of $28 million.

Government
      and Infrastructure

revenue
      for 2005 totaled $8.1 billion, a $1.3 billion decrease compared to 2004.
      Iraq-related activities in the Middle East decreased $1.6 billion primarily
      due
      to completion of our RIO contract. Partially offsetting the decrease was $362
      million higher revenue earned by the DML shipyard and hurricane repair efforts
      to United States naval facilities on the Gulf Coast under the CONCAP
      contract.

Operating
      income for 2005 was $329 million compared to $84 million in 2004, a $245 million
      increase. Iraq-related income increased $97 million compared to 2004, primarily
      due to income from the award fees on definitized LogCAP task orders, settlement
      of DFAC issues, and resolution of disputed fuel costs and other issues.
      Increased activities from our DML shipyard positively impacted 2005 operating
      income by $13 million. In addition, hurricane repair efforts to United States
      naval facilities on the Gulf Coast under the CONCAP contract contributed to
      the
      increase. The 2005 results also included a combined $96 million in operating
      income from the sale of and one-time cash distribution from an interest in
      a
      United States toll road. The operating income comparison was adversely impacted
      by completion of the RIO contract in 2004. Segment results in 2004 included
      restructuring charges of $12 million.

General
      corporate

expenses
      were $115 million in 2005 compared to $87 million in 2004. The increase was
      primarily due to increases to a self-insurance reserve, higher legal and other
      professional expenses on specific projects, and increased corporate
      communication costs.

NONOPERATING
      ITEMS

Interest
      expense

decreased $22 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the
      amortization in 2004 of issue costs related to a master letter of credit
      facility that expired in the fourth quarter of 2004, the redemption in April
      2005 of $500 million of our floating rate senior notes, and interest on tax
      deficiencies in Indonesia in 2004.

Interest
      income

increased $20 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher cash investment
      balances.

Foreign
      currency losses, net

grew to
      $13 million in 2005 from $3 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due
      to
      losses on the British pound sterling and the euro, partially offset by gains
      on
      the Brazilian real.

Other,
      net

decreased $16 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2005 year included higher
      costs related to our ESG accounts receivable securitization facility and sales
      of our United States government accounts receivable. “Other, net” in 2004
      included a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of our remaining shares of
      National Oilwell, Inc. common stock received in the January 2003 disposition
      of
      Mono Pumps.


Provision
      for income taxes

from
      continuing operations in 2005 of $64 million resulted in an effective tax rate
      of 3% compared to an effective tax rate of 37% in 2004. Our 2005 tax rate is
      lower because we recorded favorable adjustments to our valuation allowance
      against the deferred tax asset related to asbestos and silica liabilities in
      2005 totaling $805 million. Our strong 2005 earnings, coupled with an upward
      revision in our estimate of future domestic taxable income in 2006 and beyond,
      drove these adjustments.

Minority
      interest in net income of subsidiaries

increased $31 million compared to 2004 primarily due to earnings growth from
      the
      DML shipyard, our GTL joint venture project in Nigeria, and our WellDynamics
      joint venture.

Income
      (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax

in 2005
      primarily consisted of income related to Production Services operations. In
      we incurred a $778 million pretax charge for the revaluation of the 119 million
      shares of Halliburton common stock contributed to the asbestos claimant trust,
      a
      $698 million pretax charge related to the write-down of the asbestos and silica
      insurance receivable, a $44 million accrual related to a partitioning agreement,
      and an $11 million pretax charge related to a delayed-draw term facility that
      expired in June 2004. The remaining amount primarily consisted of professional
      and administrative fees related to various aspects of the asbestos and silica
      settlement.

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
      preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates.
      Our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better
      understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future
      events and related estimations and how they can impact our financial statements.
      A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult,
      subjective, or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our
      results of operations. We identified our most critical accounting policies
      and
      estimates to be:

-

percentage-of-completion
                accounting for contracts to provide construction, engineering, design,
                or
                similar services;

-

accounting
                for government contracts;

-

allowance
                for bad debts;

-

forecasting
                our effective tax rate, including our future ability to utilize foreign
                tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax
                assets;

-

legal
                and investigation matters; and

-

pensions.

We
      base
      our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we
      believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances,
      the
      results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
      of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
      We
      believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the
      preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant
      estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This
      discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
      financial statements and related notes included in this report.

We
      have
      discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies
      and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit
      Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below.

Percentage
      of completion

Revenue
      from long-term contracts to provide construction, engineering, design, or
      similar services, almost all of which relates to KBR, is reported on the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting. This method of accounting
      requires us to calculate job profit to be recognized in each reporting period
      for each job based upon our projections of future outcomes, which
      include:

-

estimates
                of the total cost to complete the
                project;

-

estimates
                of project schedule and completion
                date;

-

estimates
                of the extent of progress toward completion;
                and

-

amounts
                of any probable unapproved claims and change orders included in
                revenue.


Progress
      is generally based upon physical progress, man-hours or costs incurred depending
      on the type of job. Physical percent complete is determined as a combination
      of
      input and output measures as deemed appropriate by the
      circumstances.

At
      the
      outset of each contract, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost
      to
      complete the project. Risks related to service delivery, usage, productivity,
      and other factors are considered in the estimation process. Our project
      personnel periodically evaluate the estimated costs, claims, change orders,
      and
      percentage of completion at the project level. The recording of profits and
      losses on long-term contracts requires an estimate of the total profit or loss
      over the life of each contract. This estimate requires consideration of total
      contract value, change orders, and claims, less costs incurred and estimated
      costs to complete. Anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in
      the
      period in which they become evident. Profits are recorded based upon the total
      estimated contract profit times the current percentage complete for the
      contract.

When
      calculating the amount of total profit or loss on a long-term contract, we
      include unapproved claims as revenue when the collection is deemed probable
      based upon the four criteria for recognizing unapproved claims under the
      American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1,
      “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
      Contracts.” Including probable unapproved claims in this calculation increases
      the operating income (or reduces the operating loss) that would otherwise be
      recorded without consideration of the probable unapproved claims. Probable
      unapproved claims are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and include
      no
      profit element. In all cases, the probable unapproved claims included in
      determining contract profit or loss are less than the actual claim that will
      be
      or has been presented to the customer. We are actively engaged in claims
      negotiations with our customers, and the success of claims negotiations has
      a
      direct impact on the profit or loss recorded for any related long-term contract.
      Unsuccessful claims negotiations could result in decreases in estimated contract
      profits or additional contract losses, and successful claims negotiations could
      result in increases in estimated contract profits or recovery of previously
      recorded contract losses.

At
      least
      quarterly, significant projects are reviewed in detail by senior management.
      We
      have a long history of working with multiple types of projects and in preparing
      cost estimates. However, there are many factors that impact future costs,
      including but not limited to weather, inflation, labor and community
      disruptions, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors
      as outlined in our “Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors.” These factors
      can affect the accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future
      reported earnings. In the past, we have incurred substantial losses on projects
      that were not initially projected, including our Barracuda-Caratinga project
      (see “Barracuda-Caratinga project” in Note 3 of our consolidated financial
      statements for further discussion).

Accounting
      for government contracts

Most
      of
      the services provided to the United States government are governed by
      cost-reimbursable contracts. Services under our LogCAP, PCO Oil South, and
      Balkans support contracts are examples of these types of arrangements.
      Generally, these contracts contain both a base fee (a fixed profit percentage
      applied to our actual costs to complete the work) and an award fee (a variable
      profit percentage applied to definitized costs, which is subject to our
      customer’s discretion and tied to the specific performance measures defined in
      the contract, such as adherence to schedule, health and safety, quality of
      work,
      responsiveness, cost performance, and business management).

Base
      fee
      revenue is recorded at the time services are performed, based upon actual
      project costs incurred, and includes a reimbursement fee for general,
      administrative, and overhead costs. The general, administrative, and overhead
      cost reimbursement fees are estimated periodically in accordance with government
      contract accounting regulations and may change based on actual costs incurred
      or
      based upon the volume of work performed. Revenue is reduced for our estimate
      of
      costs that are either in dispute with our customer or have been
      identified as potentially unallowable per the terms of the contract or the
      federal acquisition regulations.

Award
      fees are generally evaluated and granted periodically by our customer. For
      contracts entered into prior to June 30, 2003, award fees are recognized during
      the term of the contract based on our estimate of amounts to be awarded. Once
      award fees are granted and task orders underlying the work are definitized,
      we
      adjust our


estimate
      of award fees to actual amounts earned. Our estimates are often based on our
      past award experience for similar types of work. We have received award fees
      on
      the Balkans project since 1995, and our estimates for award fees for this
      project have generally been accurate in the periods presented. During 2005,
      we
      began to receive LogCAP award fee scores and, based on these actual amounts,
      we
      adjusted our accrual rate for future awards. The controversial nature of this
      contract may cause actual awards to vary significantly from past
      experience.

For
      contracts containing multiple deliverables entered into subsequent to June
      30,
      2003 (such as PCO Oil South), we analyze each activity within the contract
      to
      ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of Emerging Issues Task
      Force
      Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and the
      revenue recognition guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue
      Recognition.” For service-only contracts and service elements of multiple
      deliverable arrangements, award fees are recognized only when definitized and
      awarded by the customer. The LogCAP IV contract would be an example of a
      contract in which award fees would be recognized only when definitized and
      awarded by the customer. Award fees on government construction contracts are
      recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount
      of fees to be awarded.

Similar
      to many cost-reimbursable contracts, these government contracts are typically
      subject to audit and adjustment by our customer. Each contract is unique;
      therefore, the level of confidence in our estimates for audit adjustments varies
      depending on how much historical data we have with a particular contract.
      Further, the significant size and controversial nature of our contracts may
      cause actual awards to vary significantly from past experience.

The
      estimates employed in our accounting for government contracts affect our
      Government and Infrastructure segment.

Allowance
      for bad debts

We
      evaluate our accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing
      our
      portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. This process consists
      of
      a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status
      of
      the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the
      receivables involve retentions. We also consider the economic environment of
      our
      customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating
      the
      need for an allowance. Based on our review of these factors, we establish or
      adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio
      as a whole. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation,
      and
      frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, our results of
      operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual
      write-offs that differ from estimated amounts. Our estimates of allowances
      for
      bad debts have historically been accurate. Over the last five years, our
      estimates of allowances for bad debts, as a percentage of notes and accounts
      receivable before the allowance, have ranged from 2.8% to 5.9%. At December
      31,
      2006, allowance for bad debts totaled $97 million or 2.8% of notes and accounts
      receivable before the allowance, and at December 31, 2005, allowance for bad
      debts totaled $90 million or 2.8% of notes and accounts receivable before the
      allowance. A 1% change in our estimate of the collectibility of our notes and
      accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2006 would have resulted in
      a $35
      million adjustment to 2006 total operating costs and expenses.

Income
      tax accounting

We
      account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 109 (SFAS No. 109), “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires
      recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
      and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax
      liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have
      been
      recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We apply the following
      basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:

-

a
                current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes
                payable or refundable on tax returns for the current
                year;

-

a
                deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future
                tax
                effects attributable to temporary differences and
                carryforwards;


-

the
                measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is
                based on
                provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future
                changes in tax laws or rates are not considered;
                and

-

the
                value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount
                of
                any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected
                to be
                realized.

We
      determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity
      or
      a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax
      jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures:

-

identifying
                the types and amounts of existing temporary
                differences;

-

measuring
                the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences
                using
                the applicable tax rate;

-

measuring
                the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences
                and
                operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax
                rate;

-

measuring
                the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward;
                and

-

reducing
                the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available
                evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
                the
                deferred tax assets will not be
                realized.

Our
      methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment
      in the use of assumptions and estimates. Additionally, we use forecasts of
      certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization,
      as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies.
      Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there
      can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results. Unforeseen
      events may significantly impact these variables, and changes to these variables
      could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to both
      continuing and discontinued operations.

We
      have
      operations in about 100 countries other than the United States. Consequently,
      we
      are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities.
      The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases,
      including income actually earned, income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax
      withholding. The final determination of our tax liabilities involves the
      interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in
      each
      jurisdiction. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax
      law
      and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our tax
      liabilities for a tax year.

Tax
      filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates, and related entities
      are
      routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. These
      examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to
      resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. Predicting
      the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. Factors such
      as
      the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to
      negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across
      the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate
      outcome. We review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions
      and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest,
      and penalties as needed based on this outcome.

We
      had
      recorded a valuation allowance based on the anticipated impact of the United
      States net operating loss generated from asbestos and silica deductions on
      our
      ability to utilize future foreign tax credits in the United States. This
      valuation allowance was reassessed quarterly based on a number of estimates,
      including future creditable foreign taxes and future taxable income. Factors
      such as actual operating results, material acquisitions or dispositions, and
      changes to our operating environment could alter the estimates, which could
      have
      a material impact on the valuation allowance. For example, as a result of our
      strong 2005 earnings, coupled with an upward revision in our estimate of future
      domestic taxable income for 2006 and beyond, we recorded favorable adjustments
      to this valuation allowance in 2005. Given that we fully utilized the United
      States net operating loss in 2006 and expect to begin utilizing foreign tax
      credits in the United States for 2007, the valuation allowance balance has
      been
      reduced to zero as of the end of 2006.


Legal
      and investigation matters

As
      discussed in Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements, as of December
      31, 2006, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for
      the resolution of some of these matters. For other matters for which the
      liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any
      amounts. Attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed
      against us and review all pending investigations. Generally, the estimate of
      probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with
      internal and outside legal counsel representing us. Our estimates are based
      upon
      an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and
      settlement strategies. The precision of these estimates is impacted by the
      amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. We attempt to resolve
      these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when
      possible. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after
      appeals, differ from our estimates, our future financial results may be
      adversely affected. We have in the past recorded significant adjustments to
      our
      initial estimates of these types of contingencies.

Pensions

Our
      pension benefit obligations and expenses are calculated using actuarial models
      and methods, in accordance with

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS No. 158), “Employers’ Accounting
      for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
      FASB
      Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” Two of the more critical assumptions and
      estimates used in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for
      determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return
      on plan assets. Other critical assumptions and estimates used in determining
      benefit obligations and plan expenses, including demographic factors such as
      retirement age, mortality, and turnover, are also evaluated periodically and
      updated accordingly to reflect our actual experience.

Discount
      rates are determined annually and are based on rates of return of high-quality
      fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during
      the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Expected long-term rates of
      return on plan assets are determined annually and are based on an evaluation
      of
      our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into account current
      and expected market conditions. Plan assets are comprised primarily of equity
      and debt securities. As we have both domestic and international plans, these
      assumptions differ based on varying factors specific to each particular country
      or economic environment.

The
      discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation at the
      measurement date for our United States pension plans remained flat at 5.75%
      from
      October 31, 2005 to October 31, 2006. The discount rate utilized to determine
      the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date for our United Kingdom
      pension plans, which constitute 95% of our international plans and 92% of all
      plans, remained flat at 5.0% from September 30, 2005 to September 30, 2006.
      The
      following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions,
      holding all other assumptions constant, for the United Kingdom pension
      plans.

Our
      defined benefit plans reduced pretax earnings by $83 million in 2006, $84
      million in 2005, and $91 million in 2004. Included in the amounts were earnings
      from our expected pension returns of $217 million in 2006, $196 million in
      2005,
      and $184 million in 2004. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses were being
      recognized over a period of 3 to 28 years, which represented the expected
      remaining service life of the employee group. Our unrecognized actuarial gains
      and losses arose from several factors, including experience and assumptions
      changes in the obligations and the difference between expected returns and
      actual returns on plan assets. Actual returns were $318 million in 2006, $553
      million in 2005, and $276 million in 2004. The difference between actual and
      expected


returns
      is deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax as actuarial
      gain or loss and is recognized as future pension expense. Our net actuarial
      loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2006 was $411 million. On a pretax basis,
      $43
      million of our net actuarial loss at December 31, 2006 will be recognized as
      a
      component of our expected 2007 pension expense. During 2006, we made
      contributions to fund our defined benefit plans of $190 million, which included
      $174 million contributed in order to mitigate a portion of the projected
      underfunding of our United Kingdom plans. We expect to make additional
      contributions in 2007 of approximately $84 million.

The
      actuarial assumptions used in determining our pension benefits may differ
      materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,
      higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of
      participants. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate,
      differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect
      our financial position or results of operations.

OFF
      BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Under
      an
      agreement to sell United States Energy Services Group accounts receivable to
      a
      bankruptcy-remote limited-purpose funding subsidiary, new receivables were
      added
      on a continuous basis to the pool of receivables. Collections reduced previously
      sold accounts receivable. This funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership
      interest in this pool of receivables to entities managed by unaffiliated
      financial institutions under another agreement. Sales to the funding subsidiary
      were structured as “true sales” under applicable bankruptcy laws. While the
      funding subsidiary was wholly owned by us, its assets were not available to
      pay
      any creditors of ours or of our subsidiaries or affiliates. The undivided
      ownership interest in the pool of receivables sold to the unaffiliated
      companies, therefore, was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in
      our
      consolidated balance sheets. The funding subsidiary retained the interest in
      the
      pool of receivables that were not sold to the unaffiliated companies and was
      fully consolidated and reported in our financial statements.

Under
      our
      Energy Services Group accounts receivable securitization facility we had the
      ability to sell up to $300 million in undivided ownership interest in a pool
      of
      receivables. During the fourth quarter of 2005, $256 million in undivided
      ownership interest that had been sold to unaffiliated companies was collected
      and the balance retired. No further receivables were sold, and the facility
      was
      terminated in the first quarter of 2006.

In
      May
      2004, we entered into an agreement to sell, assign, and transfer the entire
      title and interest in specified United States government accounts receivable
      of
      KBR to a third party. The face value of the receivables sold to the third party
      was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance
      sheets. The receivables outstanding under this agreement were collected and
      the
      balance retired in the third quarter of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the
      facility was terminated.

We
      have
      exposure to losses in certain unconsolidated variable interest entities. See
      Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more
      information.

FINANCIAL
      INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

We
      are
      exposed to financial instrument market risk from changes in foreign currency
      exchange rates, interest rates, and, to a limited extent, commodity prices.
      We
      selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments
      to
      mitigate our market risk from these exposures. The objective of our risk
      management program is to protect our cash flows related to sales or purchases
      of
      goods or services from market fluctuations in currency rates. We do not use
      derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments
      includes the following types of market risk:

-

volatility
                of the currency rates;

-

time
                horizon of the derivative
                instruments;

-

market
                cycles; and

-

the
                type of derivative instruments
                used.


We
      do not
      consider any of these risk management activities to be material. See Note 1
      to
      the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our
      accounting policies on derivative instruments. See Note 17 to the consolidated
      financial statements for additional disclosures related to financial
      instruments.

Interest
      rate risk

We
      have
      exposure to interest rate risk from our long-term debt.

ENVIRONMENTAL
      MATTERS

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.

In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations. Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were $43 million
      as of December 31, 2006 and $50 million as of December 31, 2005. The liability
      covers numerous properties and no individual property accounts for more than
      $5
      million of the liability balance. We have subsidiaries that have been named
      as
      potentially responsible parties along with other third parties for 12 federal
      and state superfund sites for which we have established a liability. As of
      December 31, 2006, those 12 sites accounted for approximately $10 million of
      our
      total $43 million liability. In some instances, we have been named a potentially
      responsible party by a regulatory agency, but in each of those cases, we do
      not
      believe we have any material liability.


NEW
      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Effective
      January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
      Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS
      No. 123(R)). SFAS No. 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
      Stock-Based Compensation,” (SFAS No. 123(R)) using the modified prospective
      application. Accordingly, we are recognizing compensation expense for all newly
      granted awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after January
      1,
      2006. Compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding
      as of January 1, 2006 is recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period
      based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated for our pro forma
      disclosure under SFAS No. 123. Also, beginning with the January 1, 2006 purchase
      period, compensation costs for our employee stock purchase plan are being
      expensed. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further
      information.

In
      June
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
      No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
      of FASB Statement No. 109.” This interpretation clarifies the accounting for
      uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
      in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The
      interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
      for
      a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides
      guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
      in
      interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are
      effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We did not elect
      early adoption of this interpretation and adopted the provisions of FIN 48
      beginning January 1, 2007. We have completed an initial evaluation of the impact
      of the January 1, 2007, adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption
      is
      not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results
      from operations. We expect that any adjustment to reduce beginning-of-year
      retained earnings will not exceed $40 million.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      158 (SFAS No. 158), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
      Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
      132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to:

-

recognize
                on its balance sheet the funded status (measured as the difference
                between
                the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation) of pension
                and
                other postretirement benefit plans;

-

recognize,
                through comprehensive income, certain changes in the funded status
                of a
                defined benefit and postretirement plan in the year in which the
                changes
                occur;

-

measure
                plan assets and benefit obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
                year; and

-

disclose
                additional information.

The
      requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the additional
      disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December
      15,
      2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
      the
      date of the employer’s fiscal year-end is effective for fiscal years ending
      after December 15, 2008, and we will adopt these requirements at that time.
      See
      Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further
      information.

During
      September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108),
      “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
      Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statement”. SAB 108 provides guidance on
      how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should
      be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. This interpretation
      was effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The
      adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our financial position
      or results of operations.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
      Fair
      Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an
      amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(SFAS
      159).

SFAS
      permits entities to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value.
      Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
      elected are reported in earnings.

SFAS
      is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will adopt

SFAS
      on January 1, 2008, and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our
      consolidated financial statements.


FORWARD-LOOKING
      INFORMATION AND RISK FACTORS

The
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions
      for forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is based on
      projections and estimates, not historical information. Some statements in this
      Form 10-K are forward-looking and use words like “may,” “may not,” “believes,”
“do not believe,” “expects,” “do not expect,” “anticipates,” “do not
      anticipate,” and other expressions. We may also provide oral or written
      forward-looking information in other materials we release to the public.
      Forward-looking information involves risk and uncertainties and reflects our
      best judgment based on current information. Our results of operations can be
      affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by known or unknown risks and
      uncertainties. In addition, other factors may affect the accuracy of our
      forward-looking information. As a result, no forward-looking information can
      be
      guaranteed. Actual events and the results of operations may vary
      materially.

We
      do not
      assume any responsibility to publicly update any of our forward-looking
      statements regardless of whether factors change as a result of new information,
      future events, or for any other reason. You should review any additional
      disclosures we make in our press releases and Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed
      with or furnished to the SEC. We also suggest that you listen to our quarterly
      earnings release conference calls with financial analysts.

While
      it
      is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking
      statements and potentially materially and adversely affect our financial
      condition and results of operations, including the risks related
      to:

United
      States Government Contract Work

We
      provide substantial work under our government contracts to the United States
      Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. These contracts include
      our worldwide United States Army logistics contracts, known as LogCAP, and
      United States Army Europe. Our government services revenue related to Iraq
      totaled approximately $4.7 billion in 2006, $5.4 billion in 2005, and $7.1
      billion in 2004.

Given
      the
      demands of working in Iraq and elsewhere for the United States government,
      we
      expect that from time to time we will have disagreements or experience
      performance issues with the various government customers for which we work.
      If
      performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government
      retains the right to pursue remedies which could include threatened termination
      or termination, under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated,
      we may not receive award fees under the affected contract, and our ability
      to
      secure future contracts could be adversely affected, although we would receive
      payment for amounts owed for our allowable costs under cost-reimbursable
      contracts. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers
      for
      any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as
      forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or
      debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative
      publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions
      as
      a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry,
      reduce our ability to compete for new contracts, and may also have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
      and
      cash flow.

DCAA
      audit issues

Our
      operations under United States government contracts are regularly reviewed
      and
      audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and other governmental
      agencies. The DCAA serves in an advisory role to our customer. When issues
      are
      found during the governmental agency audit process, these issues are typically
      discussed and reviewed with us. The DCAA then issues an audit report with its
      recommendations to our customer’s contracting officer. In the case of management
      systems and other contract administrative issues, the contracting officer is
      generally with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). We then work
      with
      our customer to resolve the issues noted in the audit report. If our customer
      or
      a government auditor finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract,
      these costs are not reimbursable, or, if already reimbursed, the costs must
      be
      refunded to the customer.


Security.

In
      February 2007, we received a letter from the Department of the Army informing
      us
      of their intent to adjust payments under the LogCAP III contract associated
      with
      the cost incurred by the subcontractors to provide security to their employees.
      Based on this letter, the DCAA withheld the Army’s initial assessment of $20
      million. The Army based its assessment on one subcontract wherein, based on
      communications with the subcontractor, the Army estimated 6% of the total
      subcontract cost related to the private security costs. The Army indicated
      that
      not all task orders and subcontracts have been reviewed and that they may make
      additional adjustments. The Army indicated that, within 60 days, they intend
      to
      begin making further adjustments equal to 6% of prior and current subcontractor
      costs unless we can provide timely information sufficient to show that such
      action is not necessary to protect the government’s interest. We are working
      with the Army to provide the additional information they have
      requested.

The
      Army
      indicated that they believe our LogCAP III contract prohibits us from billing
      costs of privately acquired security. We believe that, while LogCAP III contract
      anticipates that the Army will provide force protection to KBR employees, it
      does not prohibit any of our subcontractors from using private security services
      to provide force protection to subcontractor personnel. In addition, a
      significant portion of our subcontracts are competitively bid lump sum or fixed
      price subcontracts. As a result, we do not receive details of the
      subcontractors’ cost estimate nor are we legally entitled to it. Accordingly, we
      believe that we are entitled to reimbursement by the Army for the cost of
      services provided by our subcontractors, even if they incurred costs for private
      force protection services. Therefore, we believe that the Army’s position that
      such costs are unallowable and that they are entitled to withhold amounts
      incurred for such costs is wrong as a matter of law.

If
      we are
      unable to demonstrate that such action by the Army is not necessary, a 6%
      suspension of all subcontractor costs incurred to date could result in suspended
      costs of approximately $400 million. The Army has asked us to provide
      information that addresses the use of armed security either directly or
      indirectly charged to LogCAP III. The actual costs associated with these
      activities cannot be accurately estimated at this time. As of December 31,
      2006,
      no amounts have been accrued for suspended security billings.

Containers.

In
      June
      2005, the DCAA recommended withholding certain costs associated with providing
      containerized housing for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel in Iraq.
      The DCAA recommended that the costs be withheld pending receipt of additional
      explanation or documentation to support the subcontract costs. During the fourth
      quarter of 2006, we resolved approximately $25 million of the $55 million
      withheld as of December 31, 2006 with our contracting officer and received
      these
      amounts in the first quarter of 2007. Of the approximately $55 million withheld
      as of December 31, 2006, $17 million had been withheld from our subcontractors.
      We will continue working with the government and our subcontractors to resolve
      the remaining amounts.

Other
      issues.

The DCAA
      is continuously performing audits of costs incurred for the foregoing and other
      services provided by us under our government contracts. During these audits,
      there have been questions raised by the DCAA about the reasonableness or
      allowability of certain costs or the quality or quantity of supporting
      documentation. Recently, the DCAA has raised questions regarding $95 million
      of
      costs related to dining facilities in Iraq. We have responded to the DCAA that
      our costs are reasonable. The DCAA might recommend withholding some portion
      of
      the questioned costs while the issues are being resolved with our customer.
      Because of the intense scrutiny involving our government contracts operations,
      issues raised by the DCAA may be more difficult to resolve. We do not believe
      any potential withholding will have a significant or sustained impact on our
      liquidity.

Investigations

We
      provided information to the DoD Inspector General’s office in February 2004
      about contacts between former employees and our subcontractors. In the first
      quarter of 2005, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) issued two
      indictments associated with overbilling issues we previously reported to the
      Department of Defense Inspector General’s office as well as to our customer, the
      Army Materiel Command, against a former KBR procurement manager and a manager
      of
      La Nouvelle Trading & Contracting Company, W.L.L. In March 2006, one of
      these former employees pled guilty to taking money in exchange for awarding
      work
      to a Saudi Arabian subcontractor. The Inspector General’s investigation of these
      matters may continue.


In
      October 2004, we reported to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s
      office that two former employees in Kuwait may have had inappropriate contacts
      with individuals employed by or affiliated with two third-party subcontractors
      prior to the award of the subcontracts. The Inspector General’s office may
      investigate whether these two employees may have solicited and/or accepted
      payments from these third-party subcontractors while they were employed by
      us.

In
      October 2004, a civilian contracting official in the Army Corps of Engineers
      (COE) asked for a review of the process used by the COE for awarding some of
      the
      contracts to us. We understand that the Department of Defense Inspector
      General’s office may review the issues involved.

We
      understand that the DOJ, an Assistant United States Attorney based in Illinois,
      and others are investigating these and other individually immaterial matters
      we
      have reported related to our government contract work in Iraq. If criminal
      wrongdoing were found, criminal penalties could range up to the greater of
      $500,000 in fines per count for a corporation or twice the gross pecuniary
      gain
      or loss. We also understand that current and former employees of KBR have
      received subpoenas and have given or may give grand jury testimony related
      to
      some of these matters.

The
      House
      Oversight and Government Reform Committee has conducted hearings on the United
      States military's reliance on civilian contractors, including with respect
      to
      military operations in Iraq. We have provided testimony and information for
      these hearings. We expect hearings with respect to operations in Iraq to
      continue in this and other Congressional committees, including the House Armed
      Services Committee, and we expect to be asked to testify and provide information
      for these hearings.

Claims

We
      had
      unapproved claims totaling $36 million at December 31, 2006 and $69 million
      at
      December 31, 2005 for the LogCAP and PCO Oil South contracts. The unapproved
      claims outstanding at December 31, 2006, are considered to be probable of
      collection and have been recognized as revenue. Similarly, of the $69 million
      of
      unapproved claims outstanding at December 31, 2005, $57 million were considered
      to be probable of collection and have been recognized as revenue. The remaining
      $12 million of unapproved claims were not considered probable of collection
      and
      have not been recognized as revenue. These unapproved claims related to
      contracts where our costs have exceeded the customer’s funded value of the task
      order.

In
      addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had incurred approximately $159 million
      of
      costs under the LogCAP III contract that could not be billed to the government
      due to lack of appropriate funding on various task orders. These amounts were
      associated with task orders that had sufficient funding in total, but the
      funding was not appropriately allocated within the task order. We are in the
      process of preparing a request for a reallocation of funding to be submitted
      to
      the client for negotiation, and we anticipate the negotiations will result
      in an
      appropriate distribution of funding by the client and collection of the full
      amounts due.

DCMA
      system reviews

Report
      on estimating system.

In
      December 2004, the DCMA granted continued approval of our estimating system,
      stating that our estimating system is “acceptable with corrective action.” We
      are in the process of completing these corrective actions. Specifically, based
      on the unprecedented level of support that our employees are providing the
      military in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we needed to update our estimating
      policies and procedures to make them better suited to such contingency
      situations. Additionally, we have completed our development of a detailed
      training program and have made it available to all estimating personnel to
      ensure that employees are adequately prepared to deal with the challenges and
      unique circumstances associated with a contingency operation.

Report
      on purchasing system.

As a
      result of a Contractor Purchasing System Review by the DCMA during the fourth
      quarter of 2005, the DCMA granted the continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system. The DCMA’s October 2005 approval letter stated that
      our purchasing system’s policies and practices are “effective and efficient, and
      provide adequate protection of the Government’s interest.” During the fourth
      quarter of 2006, the DCMA granted, again, continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system.


Report
      on accounting system.

We
      received two draft reports on our accounting system, which raised various issues
      and questions. We have responded to the points raised by the DCAA, but this
      review remains open. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the DCAA finalized its
      report and submitted it to the DCMA, who will make a determination of the
      adequacy of our accounting systems for government contracting. We have prepared
      an action plan considering the DCAA recommendations and continue to meet with
      these agencies to discuss the ultimate resolution. The DCMA continues to approve
      KBR’s accounting system as acceptable for accumulating costs incurred under
      United States government contracts.

SIGIR
      report

In
      October 2006, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, or SIGIR,
      issued a report stating that we have improperly labeled reports provided to
      our
      customer, AMC, as proprietary data, when data marked does not relate to internal
      contractor information. We will work with AMC to address the issues raised
      by
      the SIGIR report.

Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into whether improper payments were made
      to
      government officials in Nigeria through the use of agents or subcontractors
      in
      connection with the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a
      multibillion dollar natural gas liquefaction complex and related facilities
      at
      Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related
      criminal investigation. The SEC has also issued subpoenas seeking information,
      which we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection
      with multiple projects, including current and prior projects, over the past
      years located both in and outside of Nigeria in which the Halliburton energy
      services business, The M.W. Kellogg Company, M.W. Kellogg Limited, Kellogg
      Brown
& Root or their or our joint ventures, are or were participants. In
      September 2006, the SEC requested that we enter into a tolling agreement with
      respect to its investigation. We anticipate that we will enter into an
      appropriate tolling agreement with the SEC.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem
      SpA of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (a
      subsidiary of ours and successor to The M.W. Kellogg Company), each of which
      had
      an approximately 25% interest in the venture at December 31, 2006. TSKJ and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA
      of
      Italy). M.W. Kellogg Limited is a joint venture in which KBR had a 55% interest
      at December 31, 2006; and M.W. Kellogg Limited and The M.W. Kellogg Company
      were
      subsidiaries of Dresser Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser
      Industries. The M.W. Kellogg Company was later merged with a subsidiary of
      ours
      to form Kellogg Brown & Root, one of our subsidiaries.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the FCPA. In addition to performing our own investigation, we have been
      cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ investigations and with other
      investigations into the Bonny Island project in France, Nigeria and Switzerland.
      We also believe that the Serious Frauds Office in the United Kingdom is
      conducting an investigation relating to the Bonny Island project. Our Board
      of
      Directors has appointed a committee of independent directors to oversee and
      direct the FCPA investigations. Through our committee of independent directors,
      we will continue to oversee and direct the investigations, and KBR’s directors
      who are independent of us and KBR, acting as a committee of KBR’s Board of
      Directors, will monitor the continuing investigation directed by
      us.

The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries and continuing through the current time period). We have
      produced documents to the SEC and the DOJ both voluntarily and pursuant to
      company subpoenas from the files of numerous officers and employees of
      Halliburton and KBR, including current and former executives of Halliburton
      and
      KBR, and we are making our employees available to the SEC and the DOJ for
      interviews. In addition, we understand that the SEC has issued a subpoena to
      A.
      Jack Stanley, who formerly served


as
      a
      consultant and chairman of KBR, and to others, including certain of our and
      KBR’s current and former employees, former executive officers of KBR, and at
      least one subcontractor of KBR. We further understand that the DOJ has issued
      subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we understand
      that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ and the SEC
      with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
      subpoenas.

The
      SEC
      and DOJ investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ’s engagements of
      Tri-Star Investments as an agent and a Japanese trading company as a
      subcontractor to provide services to TSKJ were utilized to make improper
      payments to Nigerian government officials. In connection with the Bonny Island
      project, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements, including with
      Tri-Star Investments, of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal, commencing in
      and a series of subcontracts with a Japanese trading company commencing in
      1996.
      We understand that a French magistrate has officially placed Mr. Tesler under
      investigation for corruption of a foreign public official. In Nigeria, a
      legislative committee of the National Assembly and the Economic and Financial
      Crimes Commission, which is organized as part of the executive branch of the
      government, are also investigating these matters. Our representatives have
      met
      with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials. In October 2004,
      representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the Nigerian legislative
      committee.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements. In February 2005,
      TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not oppose the
      Attorney General’s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in accounts of
      Tri-Star Investments in banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria and to
      have
      the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian courts.

As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe that, based on the ongoing investigations,
      payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials. In
      addition, information uncovered in the summer of 2006 suggests that, prior
      to
      1998, plans may have been made by employees of The M.W. Kellogg Company to
      make
      payments to government officials in connection with the pursuit of a number
      of
      other projects in countries outside of Nigeria. We are reviewing a number of
      recently discovered documents related to KBR activities in countries outside
      of
      Nigeria with respect to agents for projects after 1998. Certain of the
      activities discussed in this paragraph involve current or former employees
      or persons who were or are consultants to us and our investigation
      continues.

In
      June
      2004, all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant and former
      employee of M.W. Kellogg Limited were terminated. The terminations occurred
      because of violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved
      the receipt of improper personal benefits from Mr. Tesler in connection with
      TSKJ’s construction of the Bonny Island project.

In
      2006,
      we suspended the services of another agent who, until such suspension, had
      worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several current projects and on numerous
      older projects going back to the early 1980s. The suspension will continue
      until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding the agent’s compliance
      with applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct. In addition,
      we suspended the services of an additional agent on a separate current
      Nigerian project with respect to which we have received from a joint venture
      partner on that project allegations of wrongful payments made by such
      agent.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement (if applicable) generally of profit, including
      prejudgment interest on such profits, causally connected to the violation,
      and
      injunctive relief. Criminal penalties could range up to the greater of $2
      million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the
      violation, which could be substantially greater than $2 million per violation.
      It is possible that both the SEC and the DOJ could assert that there have been
      multiple violations, which could lead to multiple fines. The


amount
      of
      any fines or monetary penalties that could be assessed would depend on, among
      other factors, the findings regarding the amount, timing, nature, and scope
      of
      any improper payments, whether any such payments were authorized by or made
      with
      knowledge of us or our affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss
      involved, and the level of cooperation provided the government authorities
      during the investigations. Agreed dispositions of these types of violations
      also
      frequently result in an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the entity and the
      appointment of a monitor on terms negotiated with the SEC and the DOJ to review
      and monitor current and future business practices, including the retention
      of
      agents, with the goal of assuring compliance with the FCPA. Other potential
      consequences could be significant and include suspension or debarment of our
      ability to contract with governmental agencies of the United States and of
      foreign countries. During 2006, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $5.8 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. In addition, we may be excluded
      from bidding on MoD contracts in the United Kingdom if we are convicted for
      a
      corruption offense or if the MoD determines that our actions constituted grave
      misconduct. During 2006, KBR had revenue of approximately $1.0 billion from
      its
      government contracts work with the MoD. Suspension or debarment from the
      government contracts business would have a material adverse effect on our
      business, results of operations, and cash flows.

These
      investigations could also result in third-party claims against us, which may
      include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages,
      damage to our business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow,
      assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or business
      value, adverse consequences on our ability to obtain or continue financing
      for
      current or future projects or claims by directors, officers, employees,
      affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders
      or constituents of us or our subsidiaries. In this connection, we understand
      that the government of Nigeria gave notice in 2004 to the French magistrate
      of a
      civil claim as an injured party in that proceeding. We are not aware of any
      further developments with respect to this claim. In addition, we could incur
      costs and expenses for any monitor required by or agreed to with a governmental
      authority to review our continued compliance with FCPA law.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments relating to the Bonny Island
      project in Nigeria, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one
      or
      more competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such
      coordination possibly began as early as the mid-1980s.

On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Criminal prosecutions under applicable
      laws of relevant foreign jurisdictions and civil claims by, or relationship
      issues with customers, are also possible.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Possible
      Algerian investigation

We
      believe that an investigation by a magistrate or a public prosecutor in Algeria
      may be pending with respect to sole source contracts awarded to Brown & Root
      Condor Spa, a joint venture with Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd UK, Centre de
      Recherche Nuclear de Draria, and Holding Services para Petroliers Spa. KBR
      had a
      49% interest in this joint venture as of December 31, 2006.


Operations
      in Iran

We
      received and responded to an inquiry in mid-2001 from the Office of Foreign
      Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Treasury Department with respect
      to
      operations in Iran by a Halliburton subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman
      Islands. The OFAC inquiry requested information with respect to compliance
      with
      the Iranian Transaction Regulations. These regulations prohibit United States
      citizens, including United States corporations and other United States business
      organizations, from engaging in commercial, financial, or trade transactions
      with Iran, unless authorized by OFAC or exempted by statute. Our 2001 written
      response to OFAC stated that we believed that we were in compliance with
      applicable sanction regulations. In the first quarter of 2004, we responded
      to a
      follow-up letter from OFAC requesting additional information. We understand
      this
      matter has now been referred by OFAC to the DOJ. In July 2004, we received
      a
      grand jury subpoena from an Assistant United States District Attorney requesting
      the production of documents. We are cooperating with the government’s
      investigation and responded to the subpoena by producing documents in September
      2004.

Separate
      from the OFAC inquiry, we completed a study in 2003 of our activities in Iran
      during 2002 and 2003 and concluded that these activities were in compliance
      with
      applicable sanction regulations. These sanction regulations require isolation
      of
      entities that conduct activities in Iran from contact with United States
      citizens or managers of United States companies. Notwithstanding our conclusions
      that our activities in Iran were not in violation of United States laws and
      regulations, we announced that, after fulfilling our current contractual
      obligations within Iran, we intend to cease operations within that country
      and
      withdraw from further activities there.

Geopolitical
      and International Environment

International
      and political events

A
      significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States
      operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of
      the
      countries in which we transact business. The occurrence of any of the risks
      described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results
      of operations and consolidated financial condition.

Our
      operations in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately
      68% of our consolidated revenue during 2006 and 72% of our consolidated revenue
      during 2005. Based upon the location of services provided and products sold,
      19%
      of our consolidated revenue in 2006 and 25% during 2005 was from Iraq, primarily
      related to our work for the United States Government. Operations in countries
      other than the United States are subject to various risks unique to each
      country. With respect to any particular country, these risks may
      include:

-

expropriation
                and nationalization of our assets in that
                country;

-

political
                and economic instability;

-

civil
                unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, or other armed
                conflict;

-

natural
                disasters, including those related to earthquakes and
                flooding;

-

inflation;

-

currency
                fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion
                restrictions;

-

confiscatory
                taxation or other adverse tax
                policies;

-

governmental
                activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments, or limit
                the
                movement of funds;

-

governmental
                activities that may result in the deprivation of contract rights;
                and

-

governmental
                activities that may result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses
                required for operation.

Due
      to
      the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries and countries
      in which we provide governmental logistical support, our revenue and profits
      are
      subject to the adverse consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil
      unrest, strikes, currency controls, and governmental actions. Countries where
      we
      operate that have significant amounts of political risk include: Afghanistan,
      Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Russia, Venezuela, and Yemen. In
      addition, military action or continued unrest in the Middle East could impact
      the supply and pricing for oil and gas, disrupt our operations in the region
      and
      elsewhere, and increase our costs for security worldwide.


In
      addition, investigations by governmental authorities (see “Foreign Corrupt
      Practices Act investigations” above), as well as legal, social, economic, and
      political issues in Nigeria, could materially and adversely affect our Nigerian
      business and operations.

Our
      facilities and our employees are under threat of attack in some countries where
      we operate. In addition, the risks related to loss of life of our personnel
      and
      our subcontractors in these areas continue.

We
      are
      also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners, and agents
      outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable
      laws.

Military
      action, other armed conflicts, or terrorist attacks

Military
      action in Iraq, military tension involving North Korea and Iran, as well as
      the
      terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks,
      threats of attacks, and unrest, have caused instability or uncertainty in the
      world’s financial and commercial markets and have significantly increased
      political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which
      we
      operate. Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various
      areas in which we operate, such as the Middle East and Indonesia, could limit
      or
      disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the
      evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of personnel
      or
      assets.

Such
      events may cause further disruption to financial and commercial markets and
      may
      generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic
      areas in which we operate. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence
      of the war and ongoing military action in Iraq, such as acts of terrorism in
      the
      United States or elsewhere, could materially and adversely affect us in ways
      we
      cannot predict at this time.

Income
      taxes

We
      have
      operations in about 100 countries other than the United States. Consequently,
      we
      are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities.
      The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases,
      including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and
      revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our tax liabilities
      involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related
      authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates
      and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved
      and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes
      in
      the operating environment, including changes in tax law and
      currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our tax
      liabilities for a tax year.

Foreign
      exchange and currency risks

A
      sizable
      portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses are
      in
      foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks,
      including:

-

foreign
                exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and
                the
                implementation of exchange controls;
                and

-

limitations
                on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country
                to fund
                the capital needs of our operations in other
                countries.

We
      conduct business in countries that have nontraded or “soft” currencies which,
      because of their restricted or limited trading markets, may be more difficult
      to
      exchange for “hard” currency. We may accumulate cash in soft currencies, and we
      may be limited in our ability to convert our profits into United States dollars
      or to repatriate the profits from those countries.

We
      selectively use hedging transactions to limit our exposure to risks from doing
      business in foreign currencies. For those currencies that are not readily
      convertible, our ability to hedge our exposure is limited because financial
      hedge instruments for those currencies are nonexistent or limited. Our ability
      to hedge is also limited because pricing of hedging instruments, where they
      exist, is often volatile and not necessarily efficient.

In
      addition, the value of the derivative instruments could be impacted
      by:

-

adverse
                movements in foreign exchange
                rates;

-

interest
                rates;

-

commodity
                prices; or

-

the
                value and time period of the derivative being different than the
                exposures
                or cash flows being hedged.


Customers
      and Business

Exploration
      and production activity

Demand
      for our services and products depends on oil and natural gas industry activity
      and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural
      gas prices.

Demand
      for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of
      exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding
      capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil
      companies. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations
      in
      response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and
      natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are

beyond
      our control. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress
      the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity,
      often
      reflected as changes in rig counts. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and
      natural gas prices by oil and gas companies or longer-term higher material
      and
      contractor prices impacting facility costs can similarly reduce or defer major
      expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development
      projects. Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the
      demand for our oil and natural gas well services and products, which could
      have
      a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Factors affecting
      the prices of oil and natural gas include:

-

governmental
                regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the
                exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural
                gas reserves;

-

global
                weather conditions and natural
                disasters;

-

worldwide
                political, military, and economic
                conditions;

-

the
                level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess
                production capacity within OPEC;

-

economic
                growth in China and India;

-

oil
                refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel
                efficiency and the use of natural
                gas;

-

the
                cost of producing and delivering oil and
                gas;

-

potential
                acceleration of development of alternative fuels;
                and

-

the
                level of demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural
                gas
                in the United States.

Historically,
      the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to
      be
      volatile. Spending on exploration and production activities and capital
      expenditures for refining and distribution facilities by large oil and gas
      companies have a significant impact on the activity levels of our businesses.
      In
      the current environment where oil and gas demand exceeds supply, the ability
      to
      rebalance supply with demand may be constrained by the global availability
      of
      rigs. Full utilization of rigs could lead to limited growth in revenue. In
      addition, the extent of the growth in oilfield services may be limited by the
      availability of equipment and manpower.

Risk
      related to award of new gas monetization and upstream
      projects

With
      regard to our energy and chemical projects, worldwide resource constraints,
      escalating material and equipment prices, and ongoing supply chain pricing
      pressures are causing delays in awards of and, in some cases, cancellations
      of
      major gas monetization and upstream prospects. Certain very large scale
      projects that KBR has been pursuing for new awards have either been
      cancelled, awarded to competitors or significantly delayed. These
      developments may negatively and materially impact KBR’s 2007 and 2008 results on
      a stand alone basis (excluding consideration of potential offsets such as the
      slower than expected decline in LogCAP III activity, or work in other areas
      and
      overhead reductions that may or may not be realized). It is generally very
      difficult to predict whether or when we will receive such awards as these
      contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process
      which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing
      arrangements, governmental approvals and environmental matters.


Governmental
      and capital spending

Our
      business is directly affected by changes in governmental spending and capital
      expenditures by our customers. Some of the changes that may materially and
      adversely affect us include:

-

a
                decrease in the magnitude of governmental spending and outsourcing
                for
                military and logistical support of the type that we provide. For
                example,
                the current level of government services being provided in the Middle
                East
                will not likely continue for an extended period of time and the current
                rate of spending has decreased substantially compared to 2005 and
                2004.
                Our government services revenue related to Iraq under our LogCAP
                III and
                other contracts totaled approximately $4.7 billion in 2006, $5.4
                billion
                in 2005, and $7.1 billion in 2004. We expect to complete all open
                task
                orders under our LogCAP III contract during the third quarter of
                2007. In
                August 2006, the DoD issued a request for proposals on a new competitively
                bid, multiple service provider LogCAP IV contract to replace the
                current
                LogCAP III contract. We are currently the sole service provider under
                the
                LogCAP III contract and in October 2006, we submitted the final portion
                of
                our bid on the LogCAP IV contract. We expect that the contract will
                be
                awarded during the second quarter of 2007. We may not be awarded
                any part
                of the LogCAP IV contract. Despite the award of the August 2006 task
                order
                under our LogCAP III contract and the possibility of being awarded
                a
                portion of the LogCAP IV contract, we expect our overall volume of
                work in
                Iraq to decline as our customer scales back the amount of services
                we
                provide. However, as a result of the recently announced surge of
                additional troops in Iraq, we expect the decline to occur more slowly
                than
                previously expected;

on
                November 13, 2006, the MoD asked us to withdraw our initial public
                offering pending the MoD’s financial analysis of KBR on a stand-alone
                basis. The MoD also advised us that if we proceeded with our initial
                public offering without satisfying the MoD, the MoD would have little
                option but to take steps to cause the MoD to use its power to safeguard
                the essential security interests of the United Kingdom with respect
                to the
                Devonport Royal Dockyard. If the MoD deems it to be in the essential
                security interests of the United Kingdom, the MoD has the right to
                make
                DML’s interest in the Devonport Royal Dockyard non-voting and may have
                a
                right to remove DML’s directors of the Devonport Royal Dockyard, in which
                case DML would retain its economic interest in the Devonport Royal
                Dockyard, or the MoD may assume at any time control of the Devonport
                Royal
                Dockyard and dispose of DML’s interest on its behalf at fair value. In
                such a situation, the MoD would appoint an international firm of
                chartered
                accountants to determine the fair value for DML’s interest. In such event,
                there would be a risk that we may not agree with the determined value
                of
                DML’s interest in the Devonport Royal Dockyard, and it is unclear if
                and/or how we could challenge the determination. Any such action
                by the
                MoD would be an event of default under the DML shareholders agreement
                and
                would permit the other partners in our DML joint venture to acquire
                our
                interest in the DML joint venture at the lower of net asset value
                (generally a shareholder’s initial and subsequent investment and the
                proportionate share of consolidated capital and revenue reserves)
                or fair
                market value, which would be determined by a chartered accountant
                and
                would be final and binding absent manifest error. We believe that
                the net
                asset value of our investment in our DML joint venture may be
                significantly less than the fair market value of that investment.
                Any
                exercise by our partners in the DML joint venture of their rights
                to
                acquire our interest in DML would not prejudice any other rights
                or
                remedies available to them under the joint venture agreement or otherwise.
                Accordingly, KBR’s separation from us without satisfying the MoD, or the
                loss of DML’s interest in the Devonport Royal Dockyard and the loss of our
                interest in DML, could have a material adverse effect on our future
                prospects, business, results of operations and cash flow. We are
                engaging
                in discussions with the MoD regarding KBR’s ownership in DML and the
                possibility of reducing or disposing of our interest. Although no
                decision
                has been made with respect to a disposition or reduction of our interest
                in


DML,
                we are supporting a process to identify potential bidders that may
                have an
                interest in acquiring our interest in DML. We do not know at this
                time if
                the process will result in a disposition or reduction of our interest
                in
                DML. Revenue from our DML shipyard operations for the years ended
                December
                31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $850 million, $863 million and $738
                million,
                respectively;

-

an
                increase in the magnitude of governmental spending and outsourcing
                for
                military and logistical support, which can materially and adversely
                affect
                our liquidity needs as a result of additional or continued working
                capital
                requirements to support this work;

-

a
                decrease in capital spending by governments for infrastructure projects
                of
                the type that we undertake;

-

the
                consolidation of our customers, which
                could:

-

cause
                customers to reduce their capital spending, which would in turn reduce
                the
                demand for our services and products;
                and

-

result
                in customer personnel changes, which in turn affects the timing of
                contract negotiations and settlements of claims and claim negotiations
                with engineering and construction customers on cost variances and
                change
                orders on major projects;

-

adverse
                developments in the business and operations of our customers in the
                oil
                and gas industry, including write-downs of reserves and reductions
                in
                capital spending for exploration, development, production, processing,
                refining, and pipeline delivery networks;
                and

-

ability
                of our customers to timely pay the amounts due
                us.

Customers

Both
      our
      Energy Services Group and KBR depend on a limited number of significant
      customers. While, except for the United States Government, none of these
      customers represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period
      presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material
      adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of
      operations.

Acquisitions,
      dispositions, investments, and joint ventures

We
      continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various
      transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments,
      or joint ventures. These transactions are intended to result in the realization
      of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or income,
      or
      the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may be financed by additional
      borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also
      affect our consolidated results of operations.

These
      transactions also involve risks and we cannot ensure that:

-

any
                acquisitions would result in an increase in
                income;

-

any
                acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations
                and
                internal controls;

-

any
                disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash
                flow;

-

any
                dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not
                divert
                management resources; or

-

any
                dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not
                have a
                material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
                condition.

We
      conduct some operations through joint ventures, where control may be shared
      with
      unaffiliated third parties. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences
      in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions
      or
      in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of
      our
      joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy
      of
      our joint venture partners. These factors could potentially materially and
      adversely affect the business and operations of the joint venture and, in turn,
      our business and operations.

With
      respect to the Alice Springs-Darwin railroad project, KBR owns a 36.7% interest
      in a joint venture that is the holder of a 50-year concession contract with
      the
      Australian government to operate and maintain the railway. We account for this
      investment using the equity method of accounting in our Government and
      Infrastructure segment. This joint


venture
      has sustained losses since commencing operations due to lower than anticipated
      freight volume and a slowdown in the planned expansion of the Port of Darwin.
      At
      the end of the first quarter of 2006, the joint venture’s revised financial
      forecast led us to record a $26 million impairment charge. In October 2006,
      the
      joint venture incurred an event of default under its loan agreement by failing
      to make an interest and principal payment. These loans are non-recourse to
      us.
      In light of the default, the joint venture’s need for additional financing, and
      the realization that the joint venture efforts to raise additional equity from
      third parties were not successful, we recorded an additional $32 million
      impairment charge in the third quarter of 2006. We will receive no tax benefit
      as this impairment charge is not deductible for Australian tax purposes. In
      December 2006, the senior lenders agreed to waive existing defaults and concede
      certain rights under the existing indenture. Among these were a reduction in
      the
      joint venture’s debt service reserve and the relinquishment of the right to
      receive principal payments for 27 months, through March 2009. In exchange for
      these concessions, the shareholders of the joint venture committed approximately
      $12 million of new subordinated financing, of which $6 million was committed
      by
      us. At December 31, 2006, our investment in this joint venture was $6 million.
      Our $6 million additional funding commitment was still outstanding.

Risks
      related to contracts

Our
      long-term contracts to provide services are either on a cost-reimbursable basis
      or on a fixed-price basis. Our failure to estimate accurately the resources
      and
      time required for a fixed-price project or our failure to complete our
      contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
      condition. In connection with projects covered by fixed-price contracts, we
      bear
      the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and
      productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance. In both
      our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we generally
      rely
      on third parties for many support services, and we are subject to liability
      for
      engineering or systems failures. Occasionally we contract to perform work for,
      as well as take a minority ownership interest in, a developmental entity. We
      may
      incur contractually reimbursable costs, make an equity investment prior to
      this
      entity achieving operational status or completing its full project financing.
      Should a developmental project fail to achieve full financial close, we could
      incur losses including our contractual receivables and our equity
      investment.

Risks
      under our fixed-price contracts.

Our
      significant EPC projects may encounter difficulties that may result in
      additional costs to us, reductions in revenue, claims, or disputes. These
      projects generally involve complex design and engineering, significant
      procurement of equipment and supplies, and extensive construction management.
      Many of these projects involve design and engineering production and
      construction phases that may occur over extended time periods, often in excess
      of two years. We could encounter difficulties that may be beyond our control
      in
      design, engineering, equipment and supply delivery, schedule changes, and other
      factors. These factors could impact our ability to complete the project in
      accordance with the original delivery schedule and cost estimates. For example,
      the equipment we purchase for a project or that is provided to us by the
      customer could not perform as expected, and these performance failures may
      result in delays in completion of the project or additional costs to us or
      the
      customer to complete the project and, in some cases, may require us to obtain
      alternate equipment at additional cost.

In
      addition, some of our contracts may require that our customers provide us with
      design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used
      on
      the project. In some cases, the customer may provide us with deficient design
      or
      engineering information or equipment or may provide the information or equipment
      to us later than required by the project schedule. The customer may also
      determine, after commencement of the project, to change various elements of
      the
      project. Our project contracts generally require the customer to compensate
      us
      for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer-requested change orders
      or failure of the customer to provide us with specified design or engineering
      information or equipment. Under these circumstances, we generally negotiate
      with
      the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the
      compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we are unable
      to
      obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation, or otherwise, adequate
      amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us
      due
      to customer-requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide
      required items. A failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters
      could require us to record an adjustment to amounts of revenue and gross profit
      that were recognized in prior periods. Any such adjustments, if substantial,
      could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
      condition.


We
      may be
      required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or
      performance requirements of our contracts. In certain circumstances, we
      guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement
      of
      certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any such
      schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs, and
      the
      amount of such additional costs could exceed projected profit margins for the
      project. These additional costs include liquidated damages paid under
      contractual penalty provisions, which can be substantial and can accrue on
      a
      daily basis. In addition, our actual costs could exceed our projections. For
      example, our Tangguh contract provides for substantial liquidated damages should
      the project not be completed and provisionally accepted by the client by a
      specified date. The current estimated construction schedule for the Tangguh
      project indicates that construction will be completed just prior to the date
      specified in the contract whereby liquidated damages will be reviewed.
      Performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual
      results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and
      could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our
      client base.

Risks
      under our fixed-price or cost-reimbursable contracts.

We
      generally rely on third-party subcontractors as well as third-party equipment
      manufacturers to assist us with the completion of our contracts. To the extent
      that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, our
      ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be
      impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services
      exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price work, we could
      experience losses in the performance of these contracts. Any delay by
      subcontractors to complete their portion of the project, or any failure by
      a
      subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project, and other
      factors beyond our control may result in delays in the overall progress of
      the
      project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. These delays and
      additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to compensate the
      project customer for these delays. While we may recover these additional costs
      from the responsible vendor, subcontractor, or other third party, we may not
      be
      able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances. In addition, if a
      subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment,
      or
      materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the
      deterioration of its financial condition, we may be required to purchase the
      services, equipment, or materials from another source at a higher price. This
      may reduce the profit or award fee to be realized or result in a loss on a
      project for which the services, equipment, or materials were
      needed.

Our
      projects expose us to potential professional liability, general and third-party
      liability, warranty, and other claims. We engineer, construct, and perform
      services in large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures
      can be disastrous. Any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits
      at
      locations engineered or constructed by us or where our services are performed
      could result in significant professional liability, general and third-party
      liability, warranty, and other claims against us. The failure of any systems
      or
      facilities that we engineer or construct could result in warranty claims against
      us for significant replacement or reworking costs. In addition, once our
      construction is complete, we may face claims with respect to the performance
      of
      these facilities.

Our
      contracts generally contain provisions where our customers agree to limitations
      of our liability resulting from certain events such as damage to underground
      reservoirs and wells, costs for loss of control of a well, loss of production,
      damage to existing facilities, and consequential damages. It is also common
      to
      have arrangements with the customer and its other contractors that protect
      us
      against large exposures for damage to or loss of drilling units and injury
      to
      other contractors’ personnel. These contract provisions are standard in our
      industries, and any erosion of these contractual protections in future contracts
      could result in significant additional liability and associated
      cost.

Barracuda-Caratinga
      project.

The
      Barracuda and Caratinga vessels are both fully operational. In April 2006,
      we
      executed an agreement with Petrobras that enabled us to achieve conclusion
      of
      the Lenders’ Reliability Test and final acceptance of the FPSOs. These
      acceptances eliminate any further risk of liquidated damages being assessed
      but
      do not address the bolt arbitration discussed below.

In
      addition, at Petrobras’ direction, we have replaced certain bolts located on the
      subsea flowlines that failed through mid-November 2005, and we understand that
      additional bolts have failed thereafter, which were replaced by Petrobras.
      These
      failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted inspections of
      the
      bolts. The original design specification for the bolts was issued by Petrobras,
      and as such, we believe the cost resulting


from
      any
      replacement is not our responsibility. Petrobras has indicated, however, that
      they do not agree with our conclusion. We have notified Petrobras that this
      matter is in dispute. We believe several possible solutions may exist, including
      replacement of the bolts. Estimates indicate that costs of these various
      solutions range up to $140 million. Should Petrobras instruct us to replace
      the
      subsea bolts, the prime contract terms and conditions regarding change orders
      require that Petrobras make progress payments for our costs incurred. Petrobras
      could, however, perform any replacement of the bolts and seek reimbursement
      from
      KBR. In March 2006, Petrobras notified KBR that they have submitted this matter
      to arbitration claiming $220 million plus interest for the cost of monitoring
      and replacing the defective stud bolts and all related costs and expenses of
      the
      arbitration, including the cost of attorneys fees. We disagree with the
      Petrobras claim because the bolts met Petrobras’ design specification, and we do
      not believe there is any basis for the amount claimed by Petrobras. We intend
      to
      vigorously defend ourselves and pursue recovery of the costs we have incurred
      to
      date through the arbitration process. The arbitration hearing is not expected
      to
      begin until the first quarter of 2008. We agreed to indemnify KBR under the
      master separation agreement for all out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses,
      or
      cash settlements or cash arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur
      after
      November 20, 2006 as a result of the replacement of the subsea flowline bolts.
      See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more
      information.

Environmental
      requirements

Our
      businesses are subject to a variety of environmental laws, rules, and
      regulations in the United States and other countries, including those covering
      hazardous materials and requiring emission performance standards for facilities.
      For example, our well service operations routinely involve the handling of
      significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as
      hazardous substances. We also store, transport, and use radioactive and
      explosive materials in certain of our operations. Environmental requirements
      include, for example, those concerning:

-

the
                containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste,
                and
                other waste materials;

-

the
                importation and use of radioactive
                materials;

-

the
                use of underground storage tanks;
                and

-

the
                use of underground injection wells.

Environmental
      and other similar requirements generally are becoming increasingly strict.
      Sanctions for failure to comply with these requirements, many of which may
      be
      applied retroactively, may include:

-

administrative,
                civil, and criminal penalties;

-

revocation
                of permits to conduct business; and

-

corrective
                action orders, including orders to investigate and/or clean-up
                contamination.

Failure
      on our part to comply with applicable environmental requirements could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We are also
      exposed to costs arising from environmental compliance, including compliance
      with changes in or expansion of environmental requirements, which could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results,
      or cash flow.

We
      are
      exposed to claims under environmental requirements, and, from time to time,
      such
      claims have been made against us. In the United States, environmental
      requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability. Strict liability
      means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up
      costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct
      that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or
      other third parties. Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental
      laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our
      consolidated results of operations.

Changes
      in environmental requirements may negatively impact demand for our services.
      For
      example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result
      of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to
      environmental concerns). A decline in exploration and production, in turn,
      could
      materially and adversely affect us.

Law
      and regulatory requirements

In
      the
      countries in which we conduct business, we are subject to multiple and at times
      inconsistent regulatory regimes, including those that govern our use of
      radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals in the


course
      of
      our operations. Various national and international regulatory regimes govern
      the
      shipment of these items. Many countries, but not all, impose special controls
      upon the export and import of radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals.
      Our ability to do business is subject to maintaining required licenses and
      complying with these multiple regulatory requirements applicable to these
      special products. In addition, the various laws governing import and export
      of
      both products and technology apply to a wide range of services and products
      we
      offer. In turn, this can affect our employment practices of hiring people of
      different nationalities because these laws may prohibit or limit access to
      some
      products or technology by employees of various nationalities. Changes in,
      compliance with, or our failure to comply with these laws may negatively impact
      our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to, and transfer
      personnel or equipment among some of the countries in which we operate and
      could
      have a material adverse affect on the results of operations.

Raw
      materials

Raw
      materials essential to our business are normally readily available. Current
      market conditions have triggered constraints in the supply chain of certain
      raw
      materials, such as, sand, cement, and specialty metals. The majority of our
      risk
      associated with the current supply chain constraints occurs in those situations
      where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular
      resource.

Intellectual
      property rights

We
      rely
      on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and
      products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual
      property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated,
      circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries
      in
      which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property
      rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to
      protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property
      challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely
      affect our competitive position.

Technology

The
      market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological
      developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services.
      If we
      are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products
      and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in
      response to changes in technology, our business and revenue could be materially
      and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be
      reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment and facilities,
      or
      work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our
      business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

Systems

Our
      business could be materially and adversely affected by problems encountered
      in
      the installation of a new SAP financial system to replace some of the current
      systems for KBR.

Reliance
      on management

We
      depend
      greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to
      manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive
      officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
      business.

Technical
      personnel

Many
      of
      the services that we provide and the products that we sell are complex and
      highly engineered and often must perform or be performed in harsh conditions.
      We
      believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical
      personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these services and
      products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part
      on
      our ability to increase our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers
      is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid
      by
      competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force,
      increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events
      were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease,
      and our growth potential could be impaired.


Weather

Our
      businesses could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather,
      particularly in the Gulf of Mexico where we have operations. Repercussions
      of
      severe weather conditions may include:

-

evacuation
                of personnel and curtailment of
                services;

-

weather-related
                damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of
                operations;

-

weather-related
                damage to our facilities and project work
                sites;

-

inability
                to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules;
                and

-

loss
                of productivity.

Because
      demand for natural gas in the United States drives a significant amount of
      our
      Energy Services Group’s United States business, warmer than normal winters in
      the United States are detrimental to the demand for our services to gas
      producers.

Other
      KBR risks

Credit
      matters.

Some
      customers may require KBR to provide credit enhancements, including bonds,
      letters of credit or performance or financial guarantees. In line with industry
      practice, KBR is often required to provide performance and surety bonds to
      customers. These bonds indemnify the customer should KBR fail to perform their
      obligations under the contract. KBR has minimal stand-alone bonding capacity
      and
      other credit support capacity without Halliburton and, except to the limited
      extent set forth in the master separation agreement, Halliburton is not
      obligated to provide credit support. KBR is engaged in discussions with surety
      companies to obtain additional stand-alone bonding capacity, but they may not
      be
      successful. If a bond is required for a particular project and KBR is unable
      to
      obtain an appropriate bond, they cannot pursue that project. Moreover, due
      to
      events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally, bonding may
      be
      difficult to obtain or may only be available at significant cost. Because of
      liquidity or other issues, KBR could at times be unable to provide necessary
      letters of credit. In addition, future projects may require KBR to obtain
      letters of credit that extend beyond the term of their current credit facility.
      Further, KBR’s credit facility limits the amount of new letters of credit and
      other debt they can incur outside of the credit facility to $250 million, which
      could adversely affect their ability to bid or bid competitively on future
      projects if the credit facility is not amended or replaced. Prior to KBR, Inc.’s
      initial public offering, Halliburton has provided guarantees of most of KBR’s
      surety bonds and letters of credit as well as most other payment and performance
      guarantees under their contracts. The credit support arrangements in existence
      at the completion of KBR, Inc.’s initial public offering will remain in effect,
      but Halliburton is not expected to enter into any new credit support
      arrangements on KBR’s behalf, except to the limited extent Halliburton is
      obligated to do so under the master separation agreement. KBR has agreed to
      indemnify Halliburton for all losses under KBR’s outstanding credit support
      instruments and any additional credit support instruments for which Halliburton
      may become obligated following our initial public offering, and under the master
      separation agreement. KBR has agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
      attempt to release or replace Halliburton’s liability thereunder for which such
      release or replacement is reasonably available. Any inability by KBR to obtain
      adequate bonding and/or provide letters of credit or other customary credit
      enhancements and, as a result, to bid on new work could have a material adverse
      effect on our business prospects and future revenue.

KBR
      does
      not expect that Halliburton will provide, and Halliburton has not provided,
      payment and performance guarantees of KBR’s bonds, letters of credit and
      contracts entered into after our initial public offering as Halliburton has
      in
      the past, except to the extent Halliburton has agreed to do so under the terms
      of the master separation agreement. KBR’s customers and prospective customers
      will need assurances that KBR’s financial stability on a stand-alone basis is
      sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business
      with them. If KBR’s customers or prospective customers are not satisfied with
      KBR’s financial stability absent the support from Halliburton that KBR has
      relied on in the past, it could have a material adverse effect on KBR’s ability
      to bid for and obtain or retain projects, our business prospects and future
      revenues.

Prior
      to
      KBR, Inc.’s initial public offering, they relied upon Halliburton to fund KBR’s
      working capital demands and assist KBR in meeting their liquidity needs, thereby
      providing KBR with a reliable source of cash, liquidity and credit support
      enhancements even in unusual or unexpected circumstances. KBR is no longer
      able
      to


rely
      on
      Halliburton to meet future needs, except to the extent of credit support
      instruments outstanding at the completion of KBR, Inc.’s initial public offering
      and to the limited extent Halliburton has agreed to provide additional
      guarantees, indemnification and reimbursement commitments for KBR’s benefit in
      connection with letters of credit, surety bonds and performance guarantees
      related to certain of KBR’s existing project contracts as provided for in the
      master separation agreement. KBR has obtained limited surety capacity and is
      currently engaged in discussions with surety companies to obtain stand-alone
      bonding capacity without Halliburton or other credit support. KBR’s efforts to
      obtain this stand-alone bonding capacity may not be successful. KBR can provide
      no assurance that they will have sufficient working capital or surety support
      to
      allow them to secure large-scale contracts or satisfy contract performance
      specifications.

In
      December 2005, KBR entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility
      that provides up to $850 million of borrowings and letters of credit. This
      facility serves to assist KBR in providing working capital and letters of credit
      for their projects. The revolving credit facility contains a number of covenants
      restricting, among other things, incurrence of additional indebtedness and
      liens, sales of KBR assets, the amount of investments KBR can make, and
      dividends. KBR is also subject to certain financial covenants, including
      maintenance of ratios with respect to consolidated debt to total consolidated
      capitalization, leverage and fixed charge coverage. If KBR fails to meet the
      covenants or an event of default occurs, they would not have available the
      liquidity that the facility provides. In addition, under KBR’s existing
      revolving credit facility, and potentially under any future credit facility,
      KBR
      will be required to incur increased lending fees, costs and interest rates
      and,
      if future borrowings were to occur, to dedicate a substantial portion of their
      cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest associated
      with that debt.

Pension
      matters.

Under
      regulations applicable to pension plans maintained for the benefit of KBR’s
      employees in the United Kingdom, a disposition of KBR, Inc.’s common stock by
      Halliburton could constitute an event for which it would be advisable to obtain
      clearance from the Pensions Regulator in the United Kingdom if it were
      determined to be a change of control that is financially detrimental to the
      ability of a United Kingdom pension plan to meet its funding liabilities. In
      such event, should KBR fail to obtain clearance, the Pensions Regulator could
      issue a contribution notice, which could impose liability on an employer of
      an
      amount equal to the cost of securing all of the pension plan beneficiaries’
benefits by the purchase of annuities. As an alternative to obtaining clearance
      from the Pensions Regulator, KBR could agree with the trustee of some or all
      of
      the pension plans to provide additional security to the plans satisfactory
      to
      such trustees, which would not provide the same certainty as obtaining
      clearance, but may reduce the risk of receiving a contribution notice from
      the
      Pensions Regulator. While no determination has been made at this time as to
      the
      action, if any, that would be taken, if clearance were sought from the Pensions
      Regulator or an agreement was negotiated with the trustees for the United
      Kingdom pension plans, it may be necessary to fund some or all of the deficits
      under the United Kingdom pension plans, either in a lump sum or over an agreed
      period. Because the funding status of KBR’s United Kingdom pension plans is
      dependent on future events and circumstances and actuarial assumptions, we
      cannot estimate the range of exposure at this time.

Separation
      matters.

Halliburton currently assists KBR in performing various corporate functions,
      including the following:

-

information
                technology and communications;

-

human
                resource services such as payroll and benefit plan administration;

-

legal;

-

tax;

-

accounting;

-

office
                space and office support;

-

                management;

-

treasury
                and corporate finance; and

-

investor
                services, investor relations and corporate communications.

Following
      KBR’s anticipated complete separation from Halliburton, Halliburton will
      have no obligation to provide these functions to KBR other than the interim
      services that will be provided by Halliburton under a transition services
      agreement. Also, after the termination of this agreement, KBR may not be able
      to
      replace the transition services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions,
      including costs, as favorable as those KBR receives from Halliburton.


MANAGEMENT’S
      REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
      management of Halliburton Company is responsible for establishing and
      maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
      the
      Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal
      control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent
      limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
      provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
      preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over
      time.

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
      executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to
      assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
      of
      December 31, 2006 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control -
      Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
      the
      Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December
      31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is
      effective.

Our
      assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
      as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by our independent registered public
      accounting firm, KPMG LLP.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Halliburton
      Company:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton Company
      and
      subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
      statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
      years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated
      financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
      statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Halliburton Company and
      subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
      ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles.

As
      discussed in Notes 1 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial
      statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based
      compensation plans as of January 1, 2006, and its method of accounting for
      defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31,
      2006.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Halliburton Company’s
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
      criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      and our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
      management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
      over financial reporting.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Halliburton
      Company:

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Halliburton Company
      maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Halliburton Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
      effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
      on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Halliburton Company maintained effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
      stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Halliburton Company maintained, in all material
      respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
      31,
      2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by COSO.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton
      Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
      consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
      each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our
      report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
      consolidated financial statements.

HALLIBURTON
      COMPANY

Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Description of Company and Significant Accounting
      Policies

Description
      of Company

Halliburton
      Company’s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
      the State of Delaware in 1924. We are one of the world’s largest oilfield
      services companies and a leading provider of engineering and construction
      services. Our six business segments are: Production Optimization, Fluid Systems,
      Drilling and Formation Evaluation, and Digital and Consulting Solutions,
      collectively, the Energy Services Group (ESG); and Energy and Chemicals and
      Government and Infrastructure, collectively known as KBR. Through the ESG,
      we
      provide a comprehensive range of services and products for the exploration,
      development, and production of oil and gas. We serve major, national, and
      independent oil and gas companies throughout the world. KBR provides a wide
      range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers and to
      governmental entities worldwide.

Use
      of estimates

Our
      financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States, requiring us to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect:

-

the
                reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
                assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements;
                and

-

the
                reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
                period.

Ultimate
      results could differ from those estimates.

Basis
      of presentation

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all
      of
      our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we
      have
      determined that we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 19). All material
      intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in companies
      in which we have significant influence are accounted for using the equity
      method. If we do not have significant influence, we use the cost
      method.

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
      presentation.

Common
      share and earnings per share amounts have been restated for all periods
      presented to reflect the increased number of common shares outstanding resulting
      from the two-for-one common stock split, in the form of a stock dividend, paid
      on July 14, 2006 to shareholders of record as of June 23, 2006.

Revenue
      recognition

Overall.

Our
      service and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts
      with our customers that do not include right of return provisions or other
      significant post-delivery obligations. Our products are produced in a standard
      manufacturing operation, even if produced to our customer’s specifications. We
      recognize revenue from product sales when title passes to the customer, the
      customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, and collectibility is
      reasonably assured. Service revenue, including training and consulting services,
      are recognized when the services are rendered and collectibility is reasonably
      assured. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per
      man-hour, or similar basis.

Software
      sales.

Sales of
      perpetual software licenses, net of any deferred maintenance and support fees,
      are recognized as revenue upon shipment. Sales of time-based licenses are
      recognized as revenue over the license period. Maintenance and support fees
      are
      recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period, usually a one-year
      duration.

Percentage-of-completion.

Revenue
      from contracts to provide construction, engineering, design, or similar
      services, almost all of which relates to KBR, is reported on the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Progress is generally based
      upon
      physical progress, man-hours, or costs incurred, depending on the type of job.
      Physical percent complete is determined as a combination of input and output
      measures as deemed appropriate by the circumstances. All known or anticipated
      losses on contracts are provided for when they become evident. Claims and change
      orders that are in the process of being negotiated with customers for extra
      work
      or changes in the scope of work are included in revenue when collection is
      deemed probable.


Accounting
      for government contracts.

Most of
      the services provided to the United States government are governed by
      cost-reimbursable contracts. Services under our LogCAP, PCO Oil South, and
      Balkans support contracts are examples of these types of arrangements.
      Generally, these contracts contain both a base fee (a fixed profit percentage
      applied to our actual costs to complete the work) and an award fee (a variable
      profit percentage applied to definitized costs, which is subject to our
      customer’s discretion and tied to the specific performance measures defined in
      the contract, such as adherence to schedule, health and safety, quality of
      work,
      responsiveness, cost performance, and business management). Similar to many
      cost-reimbursable contracts, these government contracts are typically subject
      to
      audit and adjustment by our customer.

Base
      fee
      revenue is recorded at the time services are performed, based upon actual
      project costs incurred, and includes a reimbursement fee for general,
      administrative, and overhead costs. The general, administrative, and overhead
      cost reimbursement fees are estimated periodically in accordance with government
      contract accounting regulations and may change based on actual costs incurred
      or
      based upon the volume of work performed. Revenue is reduced for our estimate
      of
      costs that are either in dispute with our customer or have been
      identified as potentially unallowable per the terms of the contract or the
      federal acquisition regulations.

Award
      fees are generally evaluated and granted periodically by our customer. For
      contracts entered into prior to June 30, 2003, award fees are recognized during
      the term of the contract based on our estimate of amounts to be awarded. Once
      award fees are granted and task orders underlying the work are definitized,
      we
      adjust our estimate of award fees to actual amounts earned. Our estimates are
      often based on our past award experience for similar types of work.

For
      contracts containing multiple deliverables entered into subsequent to June
      30,
      2003 (such as PCO Oil South), we analyze each activity within the contract
      to
      ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of Emerging Issues Task
      Force
      Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and the
      revenue recognition guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
      Recognition.” For service-only contracts and service elements of multiple
      deliverable arrangements, award fees are recognized only when definitized and
      awarded by the customer. Award fees on government construction contracts are
      recognized during the term of the contract based on our estimate of the amount
      of fees to be awarded.

Sale
      of stock by a subsidiary

When,
      as
      part of a broader corporate reorganization, a subsidiary or affiliate sells
      unissued shares in a public offering, we treat the transaction as a capital
      transaction. Therefore, the increase or decrease in the carrying amount of
      our
      subsidiary’s stock would not be reflected as a gain or loss on our consolidated
      statements of operations, but as an increase or decrease to Paid-in capital
      in
      excess of par value.

Research
      and development

Research
      and development expenses are charged to income as incurred. Research and
      development expenses were $256 million in 2006, $220 million in 2005, and $234
      million in 2004, of which over 97% was company-sponsored in each
      year.

Software
      development costs

Costs
      of
      developing software for sale are charged to expense as research and development
      when incurred until technological feasibility has been established for the
      product. Once technological feasibility is established, software development
      costs are capitalized until the software is ready for general release to
      customers. We capitalized costs related to software developed for resale of
      $21
      million in 2006, $21 million in 2005, and $16 million in 2004. Amortization
      expense of software development costs was $21 million for 2006 and $22 million
      for both 2005 and 2004. Once the software is ready for release, amortization
      of
      software development costs begins. Capitalized software development costs are
      amortized over periods not exceeding five years.

Cash
      equivalents

We
      consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
      or less to be cash equivalents.


Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost represents invoice or production
      cost for new items and original cost less allowance for condition for used
      material returned to stock. Production cost includes material, labor, and
      manufacturing overhead. Some domestic manufacturing and field service finished
      products and parts inventories for drill bits, completion products, and bulk
      materials are recorded using the last-in, first-out method. The remaining
      inventory is recorded on the average cost method.

Allowance
      for bad debts

We
      establish an allowance for bad debts through a review of several factors,
      including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer
      accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables
      involve retentions.

Property,
      plant, and equipment

Other
      than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to
      impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated
      depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over
      the
      estimated useful lives of the assets. Some assets are depreciated on accelerated
      methods. Accelerated depreciation methods are also used for tax purposes,
      wherever permitted. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs
      and
      accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
      is
      recognized. We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and
      gas properties.

Goodwill

The
      reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment
      on an annual basis and more frequently when negative conditions such as
      significant current or projected operating losses exist. The annual impairment
      test for goodwill is a two-step process and involves comparing the estimated
      fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value,
      including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
      amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and the
      second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of
      a
      reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
      impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
      to
      be recorded, if any. Our annual impairment tests resulted in no goodwill
      impairment.

Evaluating
      impairment of long-lived assets

When
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than
      goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. For an asset classified
      as
      held for use, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with
      the
      asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down
      to fair value is required. When an asset is classified as held for sale, the
      asset’s book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount
      or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, depreciation and amortization
      is
      ceased while it is classified as held for sale.

Income
      taxes

We
      recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. In addition,
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
      tax
      consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
      or
      tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it
      is
      more likely than not that these items will not be realized.

In
      assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
      it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
      will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
      dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
      which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
      scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
      and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level
      of
      historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
      periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes
      it
      is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible
      differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.


We
      generally do not provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
      non-United States subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be
      reinvested indefinitely to finance foreign activities. Taxes are provided as
      necessary with respect to earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The
      American Job Creations Act of 2004 introduced a special dividends received
      deduction with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
      United States taxpayer under certain circumstances. Based on our analysis of
      the
      Act, we decided not to utilize the special deduction.

Derivative
      instruments

At
      times,
      we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected
      exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
      commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative
      or trading purposes. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
      value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected
      through the results of operations. If the derivative is designated as a hedge,
      depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives
      are either offset against:

-

the
                change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
                commitments through earnings; or

-

recognized
                in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized
                in
                earnings.

The
      ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in
      earnings. Recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage
      foreign exchange risk are included in foreign currency gains and losses in
      the
      consolidated statements of income. Gains or losses on interest rate derivatives
      are included in interest expense, and gains or losses on commodity derivatives
      are included in operating income.

Foreign
      currency translation

Foreign
      entities whose functional currency is the United States dollar translate
      monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary
      items are translated at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are
      translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for
      depreciation, cost of product sales and revenue, and expenses associated with
      nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates.
      Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are recognized in consolidated
      income in the year of occurrence. Foreign entities whose functional currency
      is
      not the United States dollar translate net assets at year-end rates and income
      and expense accounts at average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from
      these
      translations are reflected in the consolidated statements of shareholders’
equity as cumulative translation adjustments.

Halliburton
      stock-based compensation

Effective
      January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial
      Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the
      modified prospective application. Accordingly, we are recognizing compensation
      expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified, repurchased, or
      cancelled after January 1, 2006. Compensation cost for the unvested portion
      of
      awards that were outstanding as of January 1, 2006 is being recognized ratably
      over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value at date of grant.
      Also, beginning with the January 1, 2006 purchase period, compensation expense
      for our 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is being recognized. The
      cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle related to stock-based
      awards was immaterial. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for these plans
      under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board
      (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
      interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized for
      stock options or the ESPP. Compensation expense was recognized for restricted
      stock awards. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the incremental pretax
      expense related to employee stock option awards and our ESPP totaled
      approximately $41 million in 2006, or $0.02 per diluted share after
      tax.

Total
      stock-based compensation expense, net of related tax effects, was $60 million
      in
      2006. Total income tax benefit recognized in net income for stock-based
      compensation arrangements was $33 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005, and
      $9
      million in 2004. Total incremental compensation cost resulting from
      modifications of previously granted stock-based awards was $16 million in 2006,
      $19 million in 2005, and $12 million in 2004. These modifications allowed
      certain employees to retain their awards after leaving the
      company.


The
      following table summarizes the pro forma effect on net income (loss) and income
      (loss) per share for 2005 and 2004 as if we had applied the fair value
      recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

The
      fair
      value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
      option pricing model. The expected volatility of options granted in 2006 was
      a
      blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on actively traded options
      on our common stock and upon the historical volatility of our common stock.
      The
      expected volatility of options granted in 2005 and 2004 was based upon the
      historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of options granted
      in 2006, 2005, and 2004 was based upon historical observation of actual time
      elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees. The
      assumptions and resulting fair values of options granted were as
      follows:

KBR,
      Inc. stock-based compensation

For
      KBR,
      Inc. options granted in 2006, the fair value of options at the date of grant
      was
      estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility
      of KBR, Inc. options granted in 2006 is based upon a blended rate that uses
      the
      historical and implied volatility of common stock for selected peers. The
      expected term of KBR, Inc. options granted in 2006 is based upon the average
      of
      the life of the option and the vesting period of the option. The assumptions
      and
      resulting fair values of options granted were as follows:

The
      KBR,

      option awards under the KBR, Inc. 2006 Stock and Incentive Plan was
      immaterial.

See
      Note
      15 for further detail on stock incentive plans.

Note
      2. KBR, Inc. Initial Public Offering

Our
      Energy and Chemicals and Government and Infrastructure segments are part of
      KBR,
      Inc. (KBR), which was formed in March 2006. In November 2006, KBR, Inc.
      completed an initial public offering (IPO), in which it sold approximately
      million shares of KBR, Inc. common stock, at $17.00 per share. We received
      proceeds of approximately $508 million from the IPO, net of underwriting
      discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As the IPO was a result of
      a
      broader corporate reorganization, the increase in the carrying amount of our
      investment in KBR, Inc. was recorded in “Paid-in capital in excess of par value”
in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. We now hold an
      approximate 81% interest in KBR, Inc., which we consolidate for financial
      reporting purposes, represented by 135.6 million shares of KBR, Inc. common
      stock.

We
      have
      entered into various agreements relating to the separation of KBR from us,
      including, among others, a master separation agreement, a registration rights
      agreement, a tax sharing agreement, transition services agreements, and an
      employee matters agreement. The master separation agreement provides for, among
      other things, KBR’s responsibility for liabilities related to its business and
      Halliburton’s responsibility for liabilities unrelated to KBR’s business.
      Halliburton provided indemnification in favor of KBR under the master separation
      agreement for contingent liabilities, including Halliburton’s indemnification of
      KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006,
      the date of the master separation agreement, for:

-

fines
                or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages, including
                disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a governmental
                authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Nigeria,
                Switzerland and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to alleged
                or
                actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the United
                States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or particular, analogous
                applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules, and regulations in connection
                with current investigations, including with respect to the construction
                and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a natural gas liquefaction complex
                and
                related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria;
                and


-

all
                out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses, or cash settlements or cash
                arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after the effective
                date
                of the master separation agreement as a result of the replacement
                of the
                subsea flowline bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
                project.

The
      Halliburton performance guarantees and letter of credit guarantees that are
      currently in place in favor of KBR’s customers or lenders will continue after
      the separation of KBR until these guarantees expire at the earlier of: (1)
      the
      termination of the underlying project contract or KBR obligations thereunder
      or
      (2) the expiration of the relevant credit support instrument in accordance
      with
      its terms or release of such instrument by the customer. KBR will compensate
      Halliburton for these guarantees and indemnify Halliburton if Halliburton is
      required to perform under any of these guarantees. The tax sharing agreement
      provides for allocations of United States income tax liabilities and other
      agreements between us and KBR with respect to tax matters. Under the transition
      services agreements, we will continue to provide various interim corporate
      support services to KBR, and KBR continues to provide various interim corporate
      support services to us. The fees will be determined on a basis generally
      intended to approximate the fully allocated direct and indirect costs of
      providing the services, without any profit. Under an employee matters agreement,
      Halliburton and KBR have allocated liabilities and responsibilities related
      to
      current and former employees and their participation in certain benefit plans.
      KBR’s final prospectus for its initial public offering dated November 15, 2006
      contains a more detailed description of these separation
      agreements.

In
      conjunction with the closing of the KBR, Inc. IPO, KBR, Inc. granted stock
      options, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards under the KBR,
      Inc.
      2006 Stock and Incentive Plan. See Note 15 for further detail on KBR, Inc.
      stock
      incentive plans.

We
      are
      now working toward the separation of KBR, Inc. which we expect to complete
      no
      later than the end of April 2007.

On
      February 26, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan under which we will
      dispose of our remaining interest in KBR, Inc. through a tax-free exchange
      with
      Halliburton shareholders pursuant to an exchange offer and, following the
      completion or termination of the exchange offer, a special pro rata dividend
      distribution of any and all of our remaining KBR, Inc. shares. In January 2007,
      we received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, among other things,
      no gain or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a
      result of a distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of a pro rata dividend.
      We
      have requested a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that
      no
      gain or loss will be recognized by Halliburton or its shareholders as a result
      of a distribution of KBR, Inc. stock by means of an exchange offer whereby
      holders of Halliburton stock may tender their shares and receive KBR, Inc.
      shares in exchange, followed by a dividend distribution of any remaining shares
      of KBR, Inc. stock held by Halliburton to its shareholders. The exchange offer
      and any subsequent distribution of KBR, Inc. stock will not be conditioned
      on
      receipt of such a supplemental ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. We
      have
      also obtained an opinion of counsel related to the tax-free nature of the
      exchange offer and any subsequent spin-off distribution.

Note
      3. Percentage-of-Completion Contracts

Revenue
      from contracts to provide construction, engineering, design, or similar services
      is reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting using
      measurements of progress toward completion appropriate for the work performed.
      Commonly used measurements are physical progress, man-hours, and costs
      incurred.

Billing
      practices for these projects are governed by the contract terms of each project
      based upon costs incurred, achievement of milestones, or pre-agreed schedules.
      Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognized under the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Billings in excess of recognized
      revenue are recorded in “Advance billings on uncompleted contracts.” When
      billings are less than recognized revenue, the difference is recorded in
“Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts.” With the exception of claims and
      change orders that are in the process of being negotiated with customers,
      unbilled work is usually billed during normal billing processes following
      achievement of the contractual requirements.


Recording
      of profits and losses on percentage-of-completion contracts requires an estimate
      of the total profit or loss over the life of each contract. This estimate
      requires consideration of contract value, change orders and claims reduced
      by
      costs incurred, and estimated costs to complete. Anticipated losses on contracts
      are recorded in full in the period they become evident. Except in a limited
      number of projects that have significant uncertainties in the estimation of
      costs, we do not delay income recognition until projects have reached a
      specified percentage of completion. Generally, profits are recorded from the
      commencement date of the contract based upon the total estimated contract profit
      multiplied by the current percentage complete for the contract.

When
      calculating the amount of total profit or loss on a percentage-of-completion
      contract, we include unapproved claims in total estimated contract value when
      the collection is deemed probable based upon the four criteria for recognizing
      unapproved claims under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
      Statement of Position 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
      Certain Production-Type Contracts.” Including unapproved claims in this
      calculation increases the operating income (or reduces the operating loss)
      that
      would otherwise be recorded without consideration of the probable unapproved
      claims. Probable unapproved claims are recorded to the extent of costs incurred
      and include no profit element. In all cases, the probable unapproved claims
      included in determining contract profit or loss are less than the actual claim
      that will be or has been presented to the customer.

When
      recording the revenue and the associated unbilled receivable for unapproved
      claims, we only accrue an amount equal to the costs incurred related to probable
      unapproved claims. Therefore, the difference between the probable unapproved
      claims included in determining contract profit or loss and the probable
      unapproved claims accrued revenue recorded in unbilled work on uncompleted
      contracts relates to forecasted costs which have not yet been incurred. The
      amounts included in determining the profit or loss on contracts and the amounts
      booked to “Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts” or “Other assets” as of
      December 31 for each period are as follows:

Probable
                unapproved claims accrued revenue




Probable
                unapproved claims from unconsolidated related companies




As
      of
      December 31, 2006, the probable unapproved claims, including those from
      unconsolidated related companies relate to eight contracts, most of which are
      complete or substantially complete. See Note 12 for a discussion of United
      States government contract claims, which are not included in the table
      above.

A
      significant portion of the probable unapproved claims as of December 31, 2006
      ($148 million related to our consolidated entities and $45 million related
      to
      our unconsolidated related companies) arose from three completed projects with
      Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) that are currently subject to arbitration
      proceedings. In addition, we have “Other assets” of $64 million for previously
      approved services that are unpaid by PEMEX and have been included in these
      arbitration proceedings. Actual amounts we are seeking from PEMEX in the
      arbitration proceedings are in excess of these amounts. The arbitration
      proceedings are expected to extend through 2007. PEMEX has asserted unspecified
      counterclaims in each of the three arbitrations; however, it is premature based
      upon our current understanding of those counterclaims to make any assessment
      of
      their merits. As of December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts related
      to
      the counterclaims in the arbitrations.

We
      have
      contracts with probable unapproved claims that will likely not be settled within
      one year totaling $175 million at December 31, 2006 and $172 million at December
      31, 2005 included in the table above, which are reflected as “Other assets” on
      the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $12 million at December 31,
      is included in “Unbilled work on uncompleted contracts” since the contracts are
      expected to be settled within one year. Our unconsolidated related companies
      include probable unapproved claims as revenue to determine the amount of profit
      or loss for their contracts. Probable unapproved claims from our related
      companies are included in “Equity in and advances to related
      companies.”


Unapproved
      change orders

We
      have
      other contracts for which we are negotiating change orders to the contract
      scope
      and have agreed upon the scope of work but not the price. These change orders
      amounted to $81 million at December 31, 2006. Unapproved change orders at
      December 31, 2005 were $61 million. Our share of change orders from
      unconsolidated related companies totaled $3 million at December 31, 2006 and
      $5
      million at December 31, 2005.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we identified a $148 million charge, before income
      taxes
      and minority interest, related to KBR’s consolidated 50%-owned GTL project in
      Escravos, Nigeria. This charge was primarily attributable to increases in the
      overall estimated cost to complete the project. The project, which was awarded
      in April 2005, has experienced delays relating to civil unrest and security
      on
      the Escravos River, near the project site. Further delays have resulted from
      scope changes, engineering and construction modifications due to necessary
      front-end engineering design changes and increases in procurement costs due
      to
      project delays. As of September 30, 2006, we had approximately $269 million
      in
      unapproved change orders related to this project. In the fourth quarter of
      2006,
      we reached agreement with the project owner to settle $264 million of these
      change orders. As a result, portions of the remaining work now have a lower
      risk
      profile, particularly with respect to security and logistics. Since we completed
      our first check estimate in the second quarter of 2006, the project has
      continued to estimate significant additional cost increases. We currently expect
      to recover these recently identified cost increases through change orders.
      As of
      December 31, 2006, we have recorded $43 million of unapproved change orders
      which primarily relate to these cost increases. Because of the civil unrest
      and
      security issues that currently exist in Nigeria, uncertainty regarding soil
      conditions at the property site and other matters, we could experience
      substantial additional cost increases on the Escravos project in the future.
      We
      believe that future cost increases attributed to civil unrest, security matters
      and potential differences in actual rather than anticipated soil conditions
      should ultimately be recoverable through future change orders pursuant to the
      terms of our contract as amended in 2006. However, should this occur, there
      could be timing differences between the recognition of cost and recognition
      of
      offsetting potential recoveries from our client, if any. We recorded an
      additional $9 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to non-billable
      engineering services for the Escravos joint venture. These services were in
      excess of the contractual limit of total engineering costs each partner can
      bill
      to the joint venture.

Barracuda-Caratinga
      project

Following
      is the status, as of December 31, 2006, of our Barracuda-Caratinga project,
      a
      multiyear construction project to develop the Barracuda and Caratinga crude
      oilfields located off the coast of Brazil:

-

the
                Barracuda and Caratinga vessels are both fully operational. In April
                2006,
                we executed an agreement with Petrobras that enabled us to achieve
                conclusion of the Lenders’ Reliability Test and final acceptance of the
                FPSOs. These acceptances eliminate any further risk of liquidated
                damages
                being assessed but do not address the bolt arbitration discussed
                below;

                the first quarter of 2006, we recorded a loss of $15 million related
                to
                additional costs to finalize the project and warranty matters. We
                have
                recorded inception-to-date losses on this project of approximately
                $785
                million; and

-

our
                remaining obligation under the April 2006 agreement is primarily
                for
                warranty on the two vessels.

In
      addition, at Petrobras’ direction, we have replaced certain bolts located on the
      subsea flowlines that failed through mid-November 2005, and we understand that
      additional bolts have failed thereafter, which were replaced by Petrobras.
      These
      failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted inspections of
      the
      bolts. The original design specification for the bolts was issued by Petrobras,
      and as such, we believe the cost resulting from any replacement is not our
      responsibility. Petrobras has indicated, however, that they do not agree with
      our conclusion. We have notified Petrobras that this matter is in dispute.
      We
      believe several possible solutions may exist, including replacement of the
      bolts. Estimates indicate that costs of these various solutions range up to
      $140
      million. Should Petrobras instruct us to replace the subsea bolts, the prime
      contract terms and conditions regarding change orders require that Petrobras
      make progress payments for our costs incurred. Petrobras could, however, perform
      any replacement of the bolts and seek reimbursement from KBR. In March 2006,
      Petrobras notified KBR


that
      they
      have submitted this matter to arbitration claiming $220 million plus interest
      for the cost of monitoring and replacing the defective stud bolts and all
      related costs and expenses of the arbitration, including the cost of attorneys
      fees. We disagree with the Petrobras claim because the bolts met Petrobras’
design specification, and we do not believe there is any basis for the amount
      claimed by Petrobras. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves and pursue
      recovery of the costs we have incurred to date through the arbitration process.
      The arbitration hearing is not expected to begin until the first quarter of
      2008. We agreed to indemnify KBR under the master separation agreement for
      all
      out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses, or cash settlements or cash arbitration
      awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after November 20, 2006 as a result of
      the
      replacement of the subsea flowline bolts. As of December 31, 2006, we have
      not
      accrued any amounts related to this arbitration.

Note
      4. Acquisitions and Dispositions

Ultraline
      Services Corporation

In
      January 2007, we acquired all intellectual property, current assets, and
      existing business associated with Calgary-based Ultraline Services Corporation,
      a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp. Ultraline is a provider of wireline
      services in Canada. We paid approximately $177 million, subject to adjustment
      for working capital purposes. Ultraline will be included in our Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation segment.

Production
      Services

In
      the
      second quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of KBR’s Production Services
      group, which was part of our Energy and Chemicals segment. In connection with
      the sale, we received net proceeds of $265 million. The sale of Production
      Services resulted in an adjusted pretax gain, net of post-closing adjustments,
      of $120 million, which is reflected in discontinued operations. Production
      Services operations and assets and liabilities are classified as discontinued
      operations for all periods presented. At December 31, 2005, Production Services
      assets were $207 million, of which $140 million were classified as current,
      and
      liabilities were $64 million, of which $54 million were classified as
      current.

Dulles
      Greenway Toll Road

As
      part
      of our infrastructure projects, we occasionally take an ownership interest
      in
      the constructed asset, with a view toward monetization of that ownership
      interest after the asset has been operating for some period and increases in
      value. In September 2005, KBR sold its 13% interest in a joint venture that
      owned the Dulles Greenway Toll Road in Virginia. We received $85 million in
      cash
      from the sale. Because of unfavorable early projections of traffic to support
      the toll road after it had opened, we wrote down our investment in the toll
      road
      in 1996. At the time of the sale, our investment had a net book value of zero,
      and therefore, we recorded the entire $85 million of cash proceeds to operating
      income in our Government and Infrastructure segment.

Subsea
      7, Inc.

In
      January 2005, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in Subsea 7, Inc. to
      our
      joint venture partner, Siem Offshore (formerly DSND Subsea ASA), for
      approximately $200 million in cash. As a result of the transaction, we recorded
      a gain of approximately $110 million during the first quarter of 2005. We
      accounted for our 50% ownership of Subsea 7, Inc. using the equity method in
      our
      Production Optimization segment.

Surface
      Well Testing

In
      August
      2004, we sold our surface well testing and subsea test tree operations within
      our Production Optimization segment to Power Well Service Holdings, LLC, an
      affiliate of First Reserve Corporation, for approximately $129 million, of
      which
      we received $126 million in cash. During 2004, we recorded a $54 million gain
      on
      the sale.

Note
      5. Business Segment Information

We
      have
      six business segments: Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, Drilling and
      Formation Evaluation, Digital and Consulting Solutions, Energy and Chemicals,
      and Government and Infrastructure. The segments mirror the way our chief
      operating decision maker regularly reviews the operating results, assesses
      performance, and allocates resources.


During
      the second quarter of 2006, we moved slickline services, tubing conveyed
      perforating, and underbalanced applications from the Production Optimization
      segment to the Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment, as these services
      are
      more closely aligned with the Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment. Prior
      period balances were reclassified to reflect this change. Because of this
      change, what we previously referred to as “logging services” within the Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation segment we now refer to as “wireline and perforating
      services.” In addition, for internal management purposes we combined our
      Drilling and Formation Evaluation and Digital and Consulting Solutions
      divisions, resulting in three Energy Services Group internal divisions. However,
      we continue to disclose four segments for the Energy Services
      Group.

KBR’s
      Production Services operations were moved into discontinued operations for
      reporting purposes in the first quarter of 2006. All prior period amounts were
      reclassified to discontinued operations.

Energy
      Services Group

Following
      is a summary of our Energy Services Group segments.

Production
      Optimization.

The
      Production Optimization segment provides products and services for completion
      of
      wells, testing and monitoring performance of wells and reservoirs, and
      treatments to improve well productivity and increase recoverable reserves.
      This
      segment consists of production enhancement services and completion tools and
      services.

Production
      enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
      sand control services, and well intervention services. Stimulation services
      optimize oil and gas reservoir production through a variety of pressure pumping
      services, nitrogen services, and chemical processes, commonly known as hydraulic
      fracturing and acidizing. Pipeline process services include pipeline and
      facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping, chemical
      systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the midstream
      and downstream sectors of the energy business. Sand control services include
      fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the prevention of formation
      sand production. Well intervention services enable live well intervention and
      continuous pipe deployment capabilities through the use of hydraulic workover
      systems and coiled tubing tools and services.

Completion
      tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
      surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
      completion systems, expandable liner hanger systems, sand control systems,
      well
      servicing tools, and reservoir performance services. Reservoir performance
      services include testing tools, real-time reservoir analysis, and data
      acquisition services. Additionally, completion tools and services include
      WellDynamics, an intelligent well completions joint venture, which we
      consolidate for accounting purposes.

Until
      January 2005 when it was sold, subsea operations conducted by Subsea 7, Inc.,
      of
      which we formerly owned 50%, were included in this segment. Subsea 7, Inc.
      was
      accounted for by the equity method.

Fluid
      Systems.

The
      Fluid Systems segment focuses on providing services and technologies to assist
      in the drilling and construction of oil and gas wells. This segment consists
      of
      cementing services and Baroid Fluid Services.

Cementing
      services involve bonding the well and well casing while isolating fluid zones
      and maximizing wellbore stability. Our cementing service line also provides
      casing equipment.

Baroid
      Fluid Services provide drilling fluid systems, performance additives, solids
      control, and waste management services for oil and gas drilling, completion,
      and
      workover operations.

Drilling
      and Formation Evaluation.

The
      Drilling and Formation Evaluation segment is primarily involved in the drilling
      and formation evaluation process during bore-hole construction. Major services
      and products offered include Sperry Drilling Services, Security DBS Drill Bits,
      and wireline and perforating services.

Sperry
      Drilling Services provide drilling systems and services. These services include
      directional and horizontal drilling, measurement-while-drilling,
      logging-while-drilling, multilateral systems, underbalanced applications, and
      rig site information systems. Our drilling systems offer directional control
      while providing important measurements about the characteristics of the drill
      string and geological formations while drilling directional wells. Real-time
      operating capabilities enable the monitoring of well progress and aid
      decision-making processes.


Security
      DBS Drill Bits provide roller cone rock bits, fixed cutter bits, and related
      downhole tools used in drilling oil and gas wells. In addition, coring equipment
      and services are provided to acquire cores of the formation drilled for
      evaluation.

Wireline
      and perforating services include open-hole wireline services that provide
      information on formation evaluation, including resistivity, porosity, and
      density, rock mechanics, and fluid sampling. Also offered are cased-hole and
      slickline services, which provide cement bond evaluation, reservoir monitoring,
      pipe evaluation, pipe recovery, mechanical services, well intervention, and
      perforating. Perforating services include tubing-conveyed perforating services
      and products.

Digital
      and Consulting Solutions.

The
      Digital and Consulting Solutions segment provides integrated exploration,
      drilling, and production software information systems, consulting services,
      real-time operations, value-added oilfield project management, and other
      integrated solutions. Included in this business segment is Landmark, a supplier
      of integrated exploration, drilling, and production software information
      systems, as well as professional and data management services for the upstream
      oil and gas industry.

KBR

KBR
      provides a wide range of services to energy, chemical, and industrial customers
      and government entities worldwide. Management focuses on major projects within
      its two reportable segments, Energy and Chemicals and Government and
      Infrastructure. The nature of these two segments can result in a relatively
      small number of projects and joint ventures representing a substantial portion
      of operations. Following is a summary of our KBR segments.

Energy
      and Chemicals.

The
      Energy and Chemicals segment designs and constructs energy and petrochemical
      projects, including large, technically complex projects in remote locations
      around the world. Our expertise includes onshore and offshore oil and gas
      production facilities (including platforms, floating production and subsea
      facilities), onshore and offshore pipelines, LNG and GTL gas monetization
      facilities, refineries, and petrochemical plants and Syngas. We provide a
      complete range of engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning
      start-up (EPC-CS) services, as well as program and project management,
      consulting, and technology services.

TSKJ
      is a
      joint venture formed to design and construct large-scale projects in Nigeria.
      TSKJ’s members are Technip, SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V., which
      is a subsidiary of Saipem SpA of Italy, JGC Corporation of Japan, and us, each
      of which has a 25% ownership interest. TSKJ has completed five LNG production
      facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria and is currently working on a sixth such
      facility. We account for this investment using the equity method of
      accounting.

M.W.
      Kellogg Limited (MWKL) is a London-based joint venture that provides full EPC-CS
      related services for LNG, GTL, and onshore oil and gas projects. MWKL is owned
      55% by KBR and 45% by JGC Corporation. We consolidate MWKL for financial
      accounting purposes.

Brown
      & Root-Condor Spa (BRC), a joint venture with Sonatrach and another Algerian
      company, enhances our ability to operate in Algeria by providing access to
      local
      resources. BRC executes work for Algerian and international customers, including
      Sonatrach. BRC has built oil and gas production facilities and civil
      infrastructure projects, including hospitals and office buildings. KBR has
      a 49%
      interest in the joint venture. We account for this investment using the equity
      method of accounting.

Government
      and Infrastructure.

The
      Government and Infrastructure segment delivers on-demand support services across
      the full military cycle from contingency logistics and field support to
      operations and maintenance on military bases. The civil infrastructure market
      operates in diverse sectors, including transportation, waste and water
      treatment, and facilities maintenance. It provides program and project
      management, contingency logistics, operations and maintenance, construction
      management, engineering, and other services to military and civilian branches
      of
      governments and private clients worldwide. KBR is the majority owner of DML,
      which owns and operates Devonport Royal Dockyard, Western Europe’s largest naval
      dockyard complex. We consolidate DML for financial accounting
      purposes.


In
      addition, this segment includes the Alice-Springs-Darwin railroad. The Alice
      Springs-Darwin railroad is a privately financed project that was formed in
      to build, operate and own transcontinental railroad from Alice Springs to
      Darwin. Australia was granted a 50-year concession period by the Australian
      government. Government and Infrastructure provides engineering, procurement,
      and
      construction (EPC) services for the project and are the largest equity holder
      in
      the project with a 36.7 % interest, with the remaining equity held by eleven
      other participants. We account for this investment using the equity method
      of
      accounting.

Also
      included in this segment is Aspire Defence/Allenby-Connaught a joint venture
      between us, Mowlem Plc. and a financial investor formed to contract with the
      MoD
      to upgrade and service certain United Kingdom military facilities. In addition
      to a package of ongoing services to be delivered over 35 years, the project
      includes a nine-year construction program. KBR indirectly owns a 45% interest
      in
      Aspire Defence, the project company that is the holder of the 35-year concession
      contract. In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in each of the two joint ventures
      that provide the construction and related support services to Aspire Defence.
      We
      account for this investment using the equity method of accounting.

General
      corporate.

General
      corporate represents assets not included in a business segment and is primarily
      composed of cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and insurance for
      asbestos and silica litigation claims.

Other.

Intersegment
      revenue and revenue between geographic areas are immaterial. Our equity in
      earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for on
      the
      equity method is included in revenue and operating income of the applicable
      segment.

Revenue
      from the United States Government, which was derived almost entirely from our
      Government and Infrastructure segment, totaled $5.8 billion or 26% of
      consolidated revenue in 2006, $6.6 billion or 32% of consolidated revenue in
      2005, and $8.0 billion or 40% of consolidated revenue in 2004. No other customer
      represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period
      presented.

Within
      the Energy Services Group and KBR, not all assets are associated with specific
      segments. Those assets specific to segments include receivables, inventories,
      certain identified property, plant, and equipment (including field service
      equipment), equity in and advances to related companies, and goodwill. The
      remaining assets, such as cash are considered to be shared among the segments
      within the two groups. For segment operating income presentation, the
      depreciation expense associated with these shared KBR assets is allocated to
      the
      two segments under KBR.

      liabilities”)

Our
      receivables are generally not collateralized. At December 31, 2006, 27% of
      our
      consolidated receivables related to our United States government contracts,
      primarily for projects in the Middle East. Receivables from the United States
      government at December 31, 2005 represented 38% of consolidated
      receivables.

Under
      an
      agreement to sell United States Energy Services Group accounts receivable to
      a
      bankruptcy-remote limited-purpose funding subsidiary, new receivables were
      added
      on a continuous basis to the pool of receivables. Collections reduced previously
      sold accounts receivable. This funding subsidiary sold an undivided ownership
      interest in this pool of receivables to entities managed by unaffiliated
      financial institutions under another agreement. Sales to the funding subsidiary
      were structured as “true sales” under applicable bankruptcy laws. While the
      funding subsidiary was wholly owned by us, its assets were not available to
      pay
      any creditors of ours or of our subsidiaries or affiliates. The undivided
      ownership interest in the pool of receivables sold to the unaffiliated
      companies, therefore, was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in
      our
      consolidated balance sheets. The funding subsidiary retained the interest in
      the
      pool of receivables that were not sold to the unaffiliated companies and was
      fully consolidated and reported in our financial statements.

The
      amount of undivided interests which could be sold under the program varied
      based
      on the amount of eligible Energy Services Group receivables in the pool at
      any
      given time and other factors. The maximum amount that could be sold and
      outstanding under this agreement at any given time was $300 million. As of
      December 31, 2004, we had sold $256 million of undivided ownership interest
      to
      unaffiliated companies. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these receivables
      were collected and the balance retired. No further receivables were sold, and
      the facility was terminated subsequent to December 31, 2005.

In
      May
      2004, we entered into an agreement to sell, assign, and transfer the entire
      title and interest in specified United States government accounts receivable
      of
      KBR to a third party. The face value of the receivables sold to the third party
      was reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance
      sheets. The amount of receivables that could be sold under the agreement varied
      based on the amount of eligible receivables at any given time and other factors,
      and the maximum amount that could be sold and outstanding under this agreement
      at any given time was $650 million. The total amount of receivables outstanding
      under this agreement as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $263 million.
      As
      of December 31, 2005, these receivables were collected, the balance was retired,
      and the facility was terminated.

Note
      7. Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market. In the United States we manufacture
      certain finished products and parts inventories for drill bits, completion
      products, bulk materials, and other tools that are recorded using the last-in,
      first-out method, which totaled $58 million at December 31, 2006 and $42 million
      at December 31, 2005. If the average cost method had been used, total
      inventories would have been $20 million higher than reported at December 31,
      2006 and $21 million higher than reported at December 31, 2005. The cost of
      the
      remaining inventory was recorded on the average cost method. Inventories
      consisted of the following:

Note
      8. Investments

Investments
      in marketable securities

Our
      investments in marketable securities are reported at fair value. At December
      31,
      2004, our investments in marketable securities consisted of auction rate
      securities classified as available-for-sale. The 2004 balance of the auction
      rate securities was previously classified as cash and equivalents due to our
      intent and ability to quickly liquidate these securities to fund current
      operations and due to their interest rate reset feature. The auction rate
      securities were subsequently reclassified as investments in marketable
      securities. There was no impact on net income or cash flow from operating
      activities as a result of the reclassification. These auction rate securities
      were liquidated in March 2005.

Restricted
      and committed cash

At
      December 31, 2006 we had restricted cash of $132 million, which primarily
      consisted of:

-

$105
                million as collateral for potential future insurance claim reimbursements
                included in “Other assets”; and

-

$24
                million related to cash collateral agreements for outstanding letters
                of
                credit for various construction projects included in “Other current
                assets”.

At
      December 31, 2005, we had restricted cash of $123 million in “Other assets,”
which primarily consisted of similar items as above.

Cash
      and
      equivalents include cash from advanced payments related to contracts in progress
      held by ourselves or our joint ventures that we consolidate for accounting
      purposes. The use of these cash balances is limited to the specific projects
      or
      joint venture activities and is not available for other projects, general cash
      needs, or distribution to us without approval of the board of directors of
      the
      respective joint venture or subsidiary. At December 31, 2006 and December 31,
      2005, cash and equivalents included approximately $527 million and $223 million,
      respectively, in cash from advanced payments held by ourselves or our joint
      ventures that we consolidate for accounting purposes.

Note

Convertible
      notes

In
      June
      2003, we issued $1.2 billion of 3.125% convertible senior notes due July 15,
      2023, with interest payable semiannually. The notes are our senior unsecured
      obligations ranking equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured
      indebtedness.

The
      notes
      are convertible under any of the following circumstances:

-

during
                any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common
                stock
                for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive
                trading
                days ending on the last trading day of the previous quarter is greater
                than or equal to 120% of the conversion price per share of our common
                stock on such last trading day;

-

if
                the notes have been called for
                redemption;

-

upon
                the occurrence of specified corporate transactions that are described
                in
                the indenture related to the offering;
                or

-

during
                any period in which the credit ratings assigned to the notes by both
                Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s are lower than Ba1 and
                BB+, respectively, or the notes are no longer rated by at least one
                of
                these rating services or their
                successors.

The
      conversion price is $18.825 per share and is subject to adjustment upon the
      occurrence of stock dividends in common stock, the issuance of rights or
      warrants, stock splits and combinations, the distribution of indebtedness,
      securities, or assets, or excess cash distributions. The stock conversion rate
      for the notes changed as a result of the July 2006 stock split and an increase
      to our quarterly dividend. As of December 31, 2006, the stock conversion rate
      was 53.20 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. The
      distribution of KBR, Inc. stock to our shareholders, if in the form of a
      spin-off, would cause the conversion rate to change. The amount of such change
      would be based on the relative valuation of KBR, Inc. at the time of
      distribution.

Upon
      conversion, we must settle the principal amount of the notes in cash, and for
      any amounts in excess of the aggregate principal we have the right to deliver
      shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common
      stock.


See
      Note
      16 for discussion of supplemental indenture on these notes.

The
      notes
      are redeemable for cash at our option on or after July 15, 2008. Holders may
      require us to repurchase the notes for cash on July 15 of 2008, 2013, or 2018
      or, prior to July 15, 2008, in the event of a fundamental change as defined
      in
      the underlying indenture.

Senior
      notes due 2007

In
      January 2004, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
      due 2007 bearing interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR (London
      interbank offered rates) plus 0.75%, payable quarterly. In April 2005, we
      redeemed, at par plus accrued interest, all $500 million of these senior
      notes.

Floating-
      and fixed-rate senior notes

In
      October 2003, we completed an offering of $1.05 billion of floating- and
      fixed-rate unsecured senior notes. The fixed-rate notes, with an aggregate
      principal amount of $750 million, will mature on October 15, 2010 and bear
      interest at a rate equal to 5.5%, payable semiannually. The fixed-rate notes
      were initially offered on a discounted basis at 99.679% of their face value.
      The
      discount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds.
      The
      floating-rate notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $300 million and
      interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.5%, were repaid at par
      plus
      accrued interest in October 2005.

Medium-term
      notes

We
      have
      outstanding notes under our medium-term note program as follows:

In

      notes that matured. During 2006 we have repurchased $41 million of our
      medium-term notes at a total cost of $49 million. The 5.63% medium-term notes
      are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, at any time subject to a redemption
      price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of such notes or
      the
      sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
      and
      interest thereon discounted to the redemption date at the treasury rate plus
      basis points. The 7.53% notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity. The
      medium-term notes do not have sinking fund requirements and rank equally with
      our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.

Revolving
      credit facilities

In
      March
      2005, we entered into a $1.2 billion variable rate, five-year unsecured
      revolving credit agreement, which replaced a secured $700 million three-year
      revolving credit facility and a secured $500 million 364-day revolving credit
      facility. There were no cash drawings under the unsecured $1.2 billion revolving
      credit facility as of December 31, 2006.

KBR
      entered into an unsecured $850 million five-year revolving credit facility
      in
      the fourth quarter of 2005. Letters of credit that totaled $55 million were
      issued under the KBR revolving credit facility, thus reducing the availability
      under the credit facility to approximately $795 million at December 31, 2006.
      There were no cash drawings under the unsecured $850 million revolving credit
      facility as of December 31, 2006.

Debt
      covenants

Letters
      of credit related to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility contain
      restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum
      debt-to-capitalization ratio under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.
      At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with this requirement.

In
      addition, the unsecured $850 million five-year revolving letter of credit
      facility entered into by KBR contains covenants including a limitation on the
      amount KBR can invest in unconsolidated subsidiaries. KBR must also maintain
      certain financial ratios including a debt-to-capitalization ratio, a leverage
      ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, KBR was in
      compliance with these requirements.


Maturities

Our
      debt
      matures as follows: $45 million in 2007; $164 million in 2008; $5 million in
      2009; $752 million in 2010; $3 million in 2011; and $1,862 million
      thereafter.

Note
      11. Asbestos Insurance Recoveries

Several
      of our subsidiaries, particularly DII Industries and Kellogg Brown & Root,
      had been named as defendants in a large number of asbestos- and silica-related
      lawsuits. Effective December 31, 2004, we resolved all open and future claims
      in
      the prepackaged Chapter 11 proceedings of DII Industries, Kellogg Brown &
Root, and our other affected subsidiaries (which were filed on December 16,
      2003) when the plan of reorganization became final and
      nonappealable.

During
      2004, we settled insurance disputes with substantially all the insurance
      companies for asbestos- and silica-related claims and all other claims under
      the
      applicable insurance policies and terminated all the applicable insurance
      policies. Under the terms of our insurance settlements, we would receive cash
      proceeds with a nominal amount of approximately $1.5 billion and with a then
      present value of approximately $1.4 billion for our asbestos- and silica-related
      insurance receivables. The present value was determined by discounting the
      expected future cash payments with a discount rate implicit in the settlements,
      which ranged from 4.0% to 5.5%. This discount is being accreted as interest
      income (classified as discontinued operations) over the life of the expected
      future cash payments. Cash payments of approximately $167 million related to
      these receivables were received in 2006. Under the terms of the settlement
      agreements, we will receive cash payments of the remaining amounts, totaling
      $261 million at December 31, 2006, in several installments through
      2010.

The
      following table presents a rollforward of our asbestos- and silica-related
      insurance receivables.

A
      significant portion of the insurance coverage applicable to Worthington Pump,
      a
      former division of DII Industries, was alleged by Federal-Mogul (and others
      who
      formerly were associated with Worthington Pump prior to its acquisition by
      DII
      Industries) to be shared with them. During 2004, we reached an agreement with
      Federal-Mogul, our insurance companies, and another party sharing in the
      insurance coverage to obtain their consent and support of a partitioning of
      the
      insurance policies. Under the terms of the agreement, DII Industries was
      allocated 50% of the limits of any applicable insurance policy, and the
      remaining 50% of limits of the insurance policies were allocated to the
      remaining policyholders. As part of the settlement, DII Industries agreed to
      pay
      $46 million in three annual installment payments beginning in January 2005.
      In
      2004, we accrued $44 million, which represents the present value of the $46
      million to be paid. The discount is accreted as interest expense (classified
      as
      discontinued operations) over the life of the expected future cash payments
      beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004.

DII
      Industries and Federal-Mogul agreed to share equally in recoveries from
      insolvent London-based insurance companies. To the extent that Federal-Mogul’s
      recoveries from certain insolvent London-based insurance companies received
      on
      or before January 1, 2006 did not equal at least $4.5 million, DII Industries
      agreed to also pay to Federal-Mogul the difference between their recoveries
      from
      the insolvent London-based insurance companies and $4.5 million. Accordingly,
      DII Industries paid Federal-Mogul $1.6 million in January 2006. In the fourth
      quarter of 2006, we received a portion of this amount, and the remaining $1.3
      million is expected to be received back from Federal-Mogul following recoveries
      received by Federal-Mogul from the insolvent London-based insurance
      companies.


Under
      the
      insurance settlements entered into as part of the resolution of our Chapter
      proceedings, we have agreed to indemnify our insurers under certain historic
      general liability insurance policies in certain situations. We have concluded
      that the likelihood of any claims triggering the indemnity obligations is
      remote, and we believe any potential liability for these indemnifications will
      be immaterial. At December 31, 2006, we had not recorded any liability
      associated with these indemnifications.

Note
      12. United States Government Contract Work

We
      provide substantial work under our government contracts to the United States
      Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. These contracts include
      our worldwide United States Army logistics contracts, known as LogCAP, and
      United States Army Europe. Our government services revenue related to Iraq
      totaled approximately $4.7 billion in 2006, $5.4 billion in 2005, and $7.1
      billion in 2004.

Given
      the
      demands of working in Iraq and elsewhere for the United States government,
      we
      expect that from time to time we will have disagreements or experience
      performance issues with the various government customers for which we work.
      If
      performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government
      retains the right to pursue remedies which could include threatened termination
      or termination, under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated,
      we may not receive award fees under the affected contract, and our ability
      to
      secure future contracts could be adversely affected, although we would receive
      payment for amounts owed for our allowable costs under cost-reimbursable
      contracts. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers
      for
      any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as
      forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspensions or
      debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative
      publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions
      as
      a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry,
      reduce our ability to compete for new contracts, and may also have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
      and
      cash flow.

DCAA
      audit issues

Our
      operations under United States government contracts are regularly reviewed
      and
      audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and other governmental
      agencies. The DCAA serves in an advisory role to our customer. When issues
      are
      found during the governmental agency audit process, these issues are typically
      discussed and reviewed with us. The DCAA then issues an audit report with its
      recommendations to our customer’s contracting officer. In the case of management
      systems and other contract administrative issues, the contracting officer is
      generally with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). We then work
      with
      our customer to resolve the issues noted in the audit report. If our customer
      or
      a government auditor finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract,
      these costs are not reimbursable, or, if already reimbursed, the costs must
      be
      refunded to the customer. Our revenue recorded for government contract work
      is
      reduced for our estimate of costs that may be categorized as disputed or
      unallowable as a result of cost overruns or the audit process.

Security.

In
      February 2007, we received a letter from the Department of the Army informing
      us
      of their intent to adjust payments under the LogCAP III contract associated
      with
      the cost incurred by the subcontractors to provide security to their employees.
      Based on this letter, the DCAA withheld the Army’s initial assessment of $20
      million. The Army based its assessment on one subcontract wherein, based on
      communications with the subcontractor, the Army estimated 6% of the total
      subcontract cost related to the private security costs. The Army indicated
      that
      not all task orders and subcontracts have been reviewed and that they may make
      additional adjustments. The Army indicated that, within 60 days, they intend
      to
      begin making further adjustments equal to 6% of prior and current subcontractor
      costs unless we can provide timely information sufficient to show that such
      action is not necessary to protect the government’s interest. We are working
      with the Army to provide the additional information they have requested.

The
      Army
      indicated that they believe our LogCAP III contract prohibits us from billing
      costs of privately acquired security. We believe that, while LogCAP III contract
      anticipates that the Army will provide force protection to KBR employees, it
      does not prohibit any of our subcontractors from using private security services
      to provide force protection to subcontractor personnel. In addition, a
      significant portion of our subcontracts are


competitively
      bid lump sum or fixed price subcontracts. As a result, we do not receive details
      of the subcontractors’ cost estimate nor are we legally entitled to it.
      Accordingly, we believe that we are entitled to reimbursement by the Army for
      the cost of services provided by our subcontractors, even if they incurred
      costs
      for private force protection services. Therefore, we believe that the Army’s
      position that such costs are unallowable and that they are entitled to withhold
      amounts incurred for such costs is wrong as a matter of law.

If
      we are
      unable to demonstrate that such action by the Army is not necessary, a 6%
      suspension of all subcontractor costs incurred to date could result in suspended
      costs of approximately $400 million. The Army has asked us to provide
      information that addresses the use of armed security either directly or
      indirectly charged to LogCAP III. The actual costs associated with these
      activities cannot be accurately estimated at this time but we believe that
      they
      should be less than 6% of the total subcontractor costs. As of December 31,
      2006, no amounts have been accrued for suspended security billings.

Laundry.

Prior to
      the fourth quarter of 2005, we received notice from the DCAA that it recommended
      withholding $18 million of subcontract costs related to the laundry service
      for
      one task order in southern Iraq, for which it believed we and our subcontractors
      did not provide adequate levels of documentation supporting the quantity of
      the
      services provided. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the DCAA issued a notice
      to
      disallow costs totaling approximately $12 million, releasing $6 million of
      amounts previously withheld. In the second quarter of 2006, we successfully
      resolved this matter with the DCAA and received payment of the remaining $12
      million.

Containers.

In
      June
      2005, the DCAA recommended withholding certain costs associated with providing
      containerized housing for soldiers and supporting civilian personnel in Iraq.
      The DCAA recommended that the costs be withheld pending receipt of additional
      explanation or documentation to support the subcontract costs. During the fourth
      quarter of 2006, we resolved approximately $25 million of the $55 million
      withheld as of December 31, 2006 with our contracting officer and received
      these
      amounts in the first quarter of 2007. Of the approximately $55 million withheld
      as of December 31, 2006, $17 million had been withheld from our subcontractors.
      We will continue working with the government and our subcontractors to resolve
      the remaining amounts.

Dining
      facilities.

In
      September 2005, Eurest Support Services (Cyprus) International Limited, or
      ESS,
      filed suit against us alleging various claims associated with its performance
      as
      a subcontractor in conjunction with our LogCAP contract in Iraq. The case was
      settled during the first quarter of 2006 without material impact to
      us.

In
      the
      third quarter of 2006, the DCAA has raised questions regarding $95 million
      of
      costs related to dining facilities in Iraq. We have responded to the DCAA that
      our costs are reasonable.

Other
      issues.

The DCAA
      is continuously performing audits of costs incurred for the foregoing and other
      services provided by us under our government contracts. During these audits,
      there have been questions raised by the DCAA about the reasonableness or
      allowability of certain costs or the quality or quantity of supporting
      documentation. The DCAA might recommend withholding some portion of the
      questioned costs while the issues are being resolved with our customer. Because
      of the intense scrutiny involving our government contracts operations, issues
      raised by the DCAA may be more difficult to resolve. We do not believe any
      potential withholding will have a significant or sustained impact on our
      liquidity.

Investigations

We
      provided information to the DoD Inspector General’s office in February 2004
      about contacts between former employees and our subcontractors. In the first
      quarter of 2005, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) issued two
      indictments associated with overbilling issues we previously reported to the
      Department of Defense Inspector General’s office as well as to our customer, the
      Army Materiel Command, against a former KBR procurement manager and a manager
      of
      La Nouvelle Trading & Contracting Company, W.L.L. In March 2006, one of
      these former employees pled guilty to taking money in exchange for awarding
      work
      to a Saudi Arabian subcontractor. The Inspector General’s investigation of these
      matters may continue.

In
      October 2004, we reported to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s
      office that two former employees in Kuwait may have had inappropriate contacts
      with individuals employed by or affiliated with two third-party subcontractors
      prior to the award of the subcontracts. The Inspector General’s office may
      investigate whether these two employees may have solicited and/or accepted
      payments from these third-party subcontractors while they were employed by
      us.


In
      October 2004, a civilian contracting official in the Army Corps of Engineers
      (COE) asked for a review of the process used by the COE for awarding some of
      the
      contracts to us. We understand that the Department of Defense Inspector
      General’s office may review the issues involved.

We
      understand that the DOJ, an Assistant United States Attorney based in Illinois,
      and others are investigating these and other individually immaterial matters
      we
      have reported related to our government contract work in Iraq. If criminal
      wrongdoing were found, criminal penalties could range up to the greater of
      $500,000 in fines per count for a corporation or twice the gross pecuniary
      gain
      or loss. We also understand that current and former employees of KBR have
      received subpoenas and have given or may give grand jury testimony related
      to
      some of these matters.

The
      House
      Oversight and Government Reform Committee has conducted hearings on the U.S.
      military's reliance on civilian contractors, including with respect to military
      operations in Iraq. We have provided testimony and information for these
      hearings. We expect hearings with respect to operations in Iraq to continue
      in
      this and other Congressional committees, including the House Armed Services
      Committee, and we expect to be asked to testify and provide information for
      these hearings.

Claims

We
      had
      unapproved claims totaling $36 million at December 31, 2006 and $69 million
      at
      December 31, 2005 for the LogCAP and PCO Oil South contracts. The unapproved
      claims outstanding at December 31, 2006, are considered to be probable of
      collection and have been recognized as revenue. Similarly, of the $69 million
      of
      unapproved claims outstanding at December 31, 2005, $57 million were considered
      to be probable of collection and have been recognized as revenue. The remaining
      $12 million of unapproved claims were not considered probable of collection
      and
      have not been recognized as revenue. These unapproved claims related to
      contracts where our costs have exceeded the customer’s funded value of the task
      order.

In
      addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had incurred approximately $159 million
      of
      costs under the LogCAP III contract that could not be billed to the government
      due to lack of appropriate funding on various task orders. These amounts were
      associated with task orders that had sufficient funding in total, but the
      funding was not appropriately allocated within the task order. We are in the
      process of preparing a request for a reallocation of funding to be submitted
      to
      the client for negotiation, and we anticipate the negotiations will result
      in an
      appropriate distribution of funding by the client and collection of the full
      amounts due.

DCMA
      system reviews

Report
      on estimating system.

In
      December 2004, the DCMA granted continued approval of our estimating system,
      stating that our estimating system is “acceptable with corrective action.” We
      are in the process of completing these corrective actions. Specifically, based
      on the unprecedented level of support that our employees are providing the
      military in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, we needed to update our estimating
      policies and procedures to make them better suited to such contingency
      situations. Additionally, we have completed our development of a detailed
      training program and have made it available to all estimating personnel to
      ensure that employees are adequately prepared to deal with the challenges and
      unique circumstances associated with a contingency operation.

Report
      on purchasing system.

As a
      result of a Contractor Purchasing System Review by the DCMA during the fourth
      quarter of 2005, the DCMA granted the continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system. The DCMA’s October 2005 approval letter stated that
      our purchasing system’s policies and practices are “effective and efficient, and
      provide adequate protection of the Government’s interest.” During the fourth
      quarter of 2006, the DCMA granted, again, continued approval of our government
      contract purchasing system.

Report
      on accounting system.

We
      received two draft reports on our accounting system, which raised various issues
      and questions. We have responded to the points raised by the DCAA, but this
      review remains open. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the DCAA finalized its
      report and submitted it to the DCMA, who will make a determination of the
      adequacy of our accounting systems for government contracting. We have prepared
      an action plan considering the DCAA recommendations and continue to meet with
      these agencies to discuss the ultimate resolution. The DCMA continues to approve
      KBR’s accounting system as acceptable for accumulating costs incurred under
      United States government contracts.


The
      Balkans

We
      have
      had inquiries in the past by the DCAA and the civil fraud division of the DOJ
      into possible overcharges for work performed during 1996 through 2000 under
      a
      contract in the Balkans, for which inquiry has not been completed by the DOJ.
      Based on an internal investigation, we credited our customer approximately
      $2
      million during 2000 and 2001 related to our work in the Balkans as a result
      of
      billings for which support was not readily available. We believe that the
      preliminary DOJ inquiry relates to potential overcharges in connection with
      a
      part of the Balkans contract under which approximately $100 million in work
      was
      done. We believe that any allegations of overcharges would be without merit.
      In
      the fourth quarter 2006, we reached a negotiated settlement with the DOJ. KBR
      was not accused of any wrongdoing and did not admit to any wrongdoing. The
      company is not suspended or debarred from bidding for or performing work for
      the
      US government. The settlement did not have a material impact on our results
      of
      operations.

Note
      13. Other Commitments and Contingencies

Foreign
      Corrupt Practices Act investigations

The
      SEC
      is conducting a formal investigation into whether improper payments were made
      to
      government officials in Nigeria through the use of agents or subcontractors
      in
      connection with the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a
      multibillion dollar natural gas liquefaction complex and related facilities
      at
      Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria. The DOJ is also conducting a related
      criminal investigation. The SEC has also issued subpoenas seeking information,
      which we are furnishing, regarding current and former agents used in connection
      with multiple projects, including current and prior projects, over the past
      years located both in and outside of Nigeria in which the Halliburton energy
      services business, The M.W. Kellogg Company, M.W. Kellogg Limited, Kellogg
      Brown
& Root or their or our joint ventures, are or were participants. In
      September 2006, the SEC requested that we enter into a tolling agreement with
      respect to its investigation. We anticipate that we will enter into an
      appropriate tolling agreement with the SEC.

TSKJ
      is a
      private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
      are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem
      SpA of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown & Root (a
      subsidiary of ours and successor to The M.W. Kellogg Company), each of which
      had
      an approximately 25% interest in the venture at December 31, 2006. TSKJ and
      other similarly owned entities entered into various contracts to build and
      expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG Limited, which is
      owned
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell Gas B.V., Cleag Limited
      (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an affiliate of ENI SpA
      of
      Italy). M.W. Kellogg Limited is a joint venture in which KBR had a 55% interest
      at December 31, 2006; and M.W. Kellogg Limited and The M.W. Kellogg Company
      were
      subsidiaries of Dresser Industries before our 1998 acquisition of Dresser
      Industries. The M.W. Kellogg Company was later merged with a subsidiary of
      ours
      to form Kellogg Brown & Root, one of our subsidiaries.

The
      SEC
      and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements
      of
      the FCPA. In addition to performing our own investigation, we have been
      cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ investigations and with other
      investigations into the Bonny Island project in France, Nigeria and Switzerland.
      We also believe that the Serious Frauds Office in the United Kingdom is
      conducting an investigation relating to the Bonny Island project. Our Board
      of
      Directors has appointed a committee of independent directors to oversee and
      direct the FCPA investigations. Through our committee of independent directors,
      we will continue to oversee and direct the investigations, and KBR’s directors
      who are independent of us and KBR, acting as a committee of KBR’s Board of
      Directors, will monitor the continuing investigation directed by
      us.

The
      matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
      extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
      of Dresser Industries and continuing through the current time period). We have
      produced documents to the SEC and the DOJ both voluntarily and pursuant to
      company subpoenas from the files of numerous officers and employees of
      Halliburton and KBR, including current and former executives of Halliburton
      and
      KBR, and we are making our employees available to the SEC and the DOJ for
      interviews. In addition, we understand that the SEC has issued a subpoena to
      A.
      Jack Stanley, who formerly served


as
      a
      consultant and chairman of KBR, and to others, including certain of our and
      KBR’s current and former employees, former executive officers of KBR, and at
      least one subcontractor of KBR. We further understand that the DOJ has issued
      subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we understand
      that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ and the SEC
      with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
      subpoenas.

The
      SEC
      and DOJ investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ’s engagements of
      Tri-Star Investments as an agent and a Japanese trading company as a
      subcontractor to provide services to TSKJ were utilized to make improper
      payments to Nigerian government officials. In connection with the Bonny Island
      project, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements, including with
      Tri-Star Investments, of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal, commencing in
      and a series of subcontracts with a Japanese trading company commencing in
      1996.
      We understand that a French magistrate has officially placed Mr. Tesler under
      investigation for corruption of a foreign public official. In Nigeria, a
      legislative committee of the National Assembly and the Economic and Financial
      Crimes Commission, which is organized as part of the executive branch of the
      government, are also investigating these matters. Our representatives have
      met
      with the French magistrate and Nigerian officials. In October 2004,
      representatives of TSKJ voluntarily testified before the Nigerian legislative
      committee.

We
      notified the other owners of TSKJ of information provided by the investigations
      and asked each of them to conduct their own investigation. TSKJ has suspended
      the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and the
      Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
      declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
      recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements. In February 2005,
      TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not oppose the
      Attorney General’s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in accounts of
      Tri-Star Investments in banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria and to
      have
      the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian courts.

As
      a
      result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
      commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
      officials. We have reason to believe that, based on the ongoing investigations,
      payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials. In
      addition, information uncovered in the summer of 2006 suggests that, prior
      to
      1998, plans may have been made by employees of The M.W. Kellogg Company to
      make
      payments to government officials in connection with the pursuit of a number
      of
      other projects in countries outside of Nigeria. We are reviewing a number of
      recently discovered documents related to KBR activities in countries outside
      of
      Nigeria with respect to agents for projects after 1998. Certain of the
      activities discussed in this paragraph involve current or former employees
      or persons who were or are consultants to us and our investigation
      continues.

In
      June
      2004, all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant and former
      employee of M.W. Kellogg Limited were terminated. The terminations occurred
      because of violations of our Code of Business Conduct that allegedly involved
      the receipt of improper personal benefits from Mr. Tesler in connection with
      TSKJ’s construction of the Bonny Island project.

In
      2006,
      we suspended the services of another agent who, until such suspension, had
      worked for KBR outside of Nigeria on several current projects and on numerous
      older projects going back to the early 1980s. The suspension will continue
      until
      such time, if ever, as we can satisfy ourselves regarding the agent’s compliance
      with applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct. In addition,
      we suspended the services of an additional agent on a separate current
      Nigerian project with respect to which we have received from a joint venture
      partner on that project allegations of wrongful payments made by such
      agent.

If
      violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
      be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
      remedies, including disgorgement (if applicable) generally of profit, including
      prejudgment interest on such profits, causally connected to the violation,
      and
      injunctive relief. Criminal penalties could range up to the greater of $2
      million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the
      violation, which could be substantially greater than $2 million per violation.
      It is possible that both the SEC and the DOJ could assert that there have been
      multiple violations, which could lead to multiple fines. The


amount
      of
      any fines or monetary penalties that could be assessed would depend on, among
      other factors, the findings regarding the amount, timing, nature, and scope
      of
      any improper payments, whether any such payments were authorized by or made
      with
      knowledge of us or our affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss
      involved, and the level of cooperation provided the government authorities
      during the investigations. Agreed dispositions of these types of violations
      also
      frequently result in an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the entity and the
      appointment of a monitor on terms negotiated with the SEC and the DOJ to review
      and monitor current and future business practices, including the retention
      of
      agents, with the goal of assuring compliance with the FCPA. Other potential
      consequences could be significant and include suspension or debarment of our
      ability to contract with governmental agencies of the United States and of
      foreign countries. During 2006, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of
      approximately $5.8 billion from its government contracts work with agencies
      of
      the United States or state or local governments. If necessary, we would seek
      to
      obtain administrative agreements or waivers from the United States Department
      of
      Defense (DoD) and other agencies to avoid suspension or debarment. In addition,
      we may be excluded from bidding on United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MoD)
      contracts in the United Kingdom if we are convicted for a corruption offense
      or
      if the MoD determines that our actions constituted grave misconduct. During
      2006, KBR had revenue of approximately $1.0 billion from its government
      contracts work with the MoD. Suspension or debarment from the government
      contracts business would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
      of operations, and cash flows.

These
      investigations could also result in third-party claims against us, which may
      include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages,
      damage to our business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow,
      assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or business
      value, adverse consequences on our ability to obtain or continue financing
      for
      current or future projects or claims by directors, officers, employees,
      affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders
      or constituents of us or our subsidiaries. In this connection, we understand
      that the government of Nigeria gave notice in 2004 to the French magistrate
      of a
      civil claim as an injured party in that proceeding. We are not aware of any
      further developments with respect to this claim. In addition, we could incur
      costs and expenses for any monitor required by or agreed to with a governmental
      authority to review our continued compliance with FCPA law.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Bidding
      practices investigation

In
      connection with the investigation into payments relating to the Bonny Island
      project in Nigeria, information has been uncovered suggesting that Mr. Stanley
      and other former employees may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one
      or
      more competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such
      coordination possibly began as early as the mid-1980s.

On
      the
      basis of this information, we and the DOJ have broadened our investigations
      to
      determine the nature and extent of any improper bidding practices, whether
      such
      conduct violated United States antitrust laws, and whether former employees
      may
      have received payments in connection with bidding practices on some foreign
      projects.

If
      violations of applicable United States antitrust laws occurred, the range of
      possible penalties includes criminal fines, which could range up to the greater
      of $10 million in fines per count for a corporation, or twice the gross
      pecuniary gain or loss, and treble civil damages in favor of any persons
      financially injured by such violations. Criminal prosecutions under applicable
      laws of relevant foreign jurisdictions and civil claims by, or relationship
      issues with customers, are also possible.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or
      a
      range of possible loss related to these matters.

Possible
      Algerian investigation

We
      believe that an investigation by a magistrate or a public prosecutor in Algeria
      may be pending with respect to sole source contracts awarded to Brown & Root
      Condor Spa, a joint venture with Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd UK, Centre de
      Recherche Nuclear de Draria, and Holding Services para Petroliers Spa. KBR
      had a
      49% interest in this joint venture as of December 31, 2006.


Securities
      and related litigation

In
      June
      2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against us in federal court on behalf
      of
      purchasers of our common stock during the approximate period of May 1998 until
      May 2002 alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
      the accounting change and disclosures involved in the SEC investigation related
      to a change in accounting for revenue on long-term construction projects and
      related disclosures, which we settled with the SEC in the second quarter of
      2004. In addition, the plaintiffs allege that we overstated our revenue from
      unapproved claims by recognizing amounts not reasonably estimable or probable
      of
      collection. In the weeks that followed, approximately twenty similar class
      actions were filed against us. Several of those lawsuits also named as
      defendants Arthur Andersen LLP, our independent accountants for the period
      covered by the lawsuits, and several of our present or former officers and
      directors. The class action cases were later consolidated, and the amended
      consolidated class action complaint, styled

Richard
      Moore, et al. v. Halliburton Company, et al.,

was
      filed and served upon us in April 2003 (the “

Moore

class
      action”).

In
      early
      May 2003, we announced that we had entered into a written memorandum of
      understanding setting forth the terms upon which the

Moore

class
      action would be settled. In June 2003, the lead plaintiffs in the

Moore

class
      action filed a motion for leave to file a second amended consolidated complaint,
      which was granted by the court. In addition to restating the original accounting
      and disclosure claims, the second amended consolidated complaint included claims
      arising out of the 1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries, Inc. by Halliburton,
      including that we failed to timely disclose the resulting asbestos liability
      exposure (the “Dresser claims”). The Dresser claims were included in the
      settlement discussions leading up to the signing of the memorandum of
      understanding and were among the claims the parties intended to have resolved
      by
      the terms of the proposed settlement of the consolidated

Moore

class
      action and the derivative action. The memorandum of understanding called for
      Halliburton to pay $6 million, which would be funded by insurance
      proceeds.

In
      June
      2004, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement.
      Following the transfer of the case to another district judge and a final hearing
      on the fairness of the settlement the court entered an order in September 2004
      holding that evidence of the settlement’s fairness was inadequate, denying the
      motion for final approval of the settlement in the

Moore

class
      action, and ordering the parties, among other things, to mediate. After the
      court’s denial of the motion to approve the settlement, we withdrew from the
      settlement as we believe we were entitled to do by its terms. The mediation
      was
      held in January 2005, but was declared by the mediator to be at an impasse
      with
      no settlement reached.

In
      April
      2005, the court appointed new co-lead counsel and a new lead plaintiff,
      directing that they file a third consolidated amended complaint and that we
      file
      our motion to dismiss. The court held oral arguments on that motion in August
      2005, at which time the court took the motion under advisement. In March 2006,
      the court entered an order in which it granted the motion to dismiss with
      respect to claims arising prior to June 1999 and granted the motion with respect
      to certain other claims while permitting the plaintiffs to repled those claims
      to correct deficiencies in their earlier complaint. In April 2006, the
      plaintiffs filed their fourth amended consolidated complaint. We filed a motion
      to dismiss those portions of the complaint that had been repled. A hearing
      was
      held on that motion in July 2006, and we await the court’s ruling. The lead
      plaintiff has filed a motion to discharge and replace co-lead counsel. That
      motion was granted on February 26, 2007.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts related to this
      matter.

Newmont
      Gold

In
      July
      1998, Newmont Gold, a gold mining and extraction company, filed a lawsuit over
      the failure of a blower manufactured and supplied to Newmont by Roots, a former
      division of Dresser Equipment Group. The plaintiff alleged that during the
      manufacturing process, Roots had reversed the blades of a component of the
      blower known as the inlet guide vane assembly, resulting in the blower’s failure
      and the shutdown of the gold extraction mill for a period of approximately
      one
      month during 1996. In January 2002, a Nevada trial court granted summary
      judgment to Roots on all counts, and Newmont appealed. In February 2004, the
      Nevada Supreme Court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case to
      the
      trial court, holding that fact issues existed requiring a trial. Based on
      pretrial reports, the damages claimed by the plaintiff were in the range of
      $33
      million to $39 million, and trial was scheduled for February 2007. During the
      fourth quarter of 2006, the case was settled with no material impact on
      us.


Improper
      payments reported to the SEC

During
      the second quarter of 2002, we reported to the SEC that one of our foreign
      subsidiaries operating in Nigeria made improper payments of approximately $2.4
      million to entities owned by a Nigerian national who held himself out as a
      tax
      consultant, when in fact he was an employee of a local tax authority. The
      payments were made to obtain favorable tax treatment and clearly violated our
      Code of Business Conduct and our internal control procedures. The payments
      were
      discovered during our audit of the foreign subsidiary. We conducted an
      investigation assisted by outside legal counsel, and, based on the findings
      of
      the investigation, we terminated several employees. None of our senior officers
      were involved. We are cooperating with the SEC in its review of the matter.
      We
      took further action to ensure that our foreign subsidiary paid all taxes owed
      in
      Nigeria. A preliminary assessment of approximately $4 million was issued by
      the
      Nigerian tax authorities in the second quarter of 2003. We are cooperating
      with
      the Nigerian tax authorities to determine the total amount due as quickly as
      possible.

Operations
      in Iran

We
      received and responded to an inquiry in mid-2001 from the Office of Foreign
      Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Treasury Department with respect
      to
      operations in Iran by a Halliburton subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman
      Islands. The OFAC inquiry requested information with respect to compliance
      with
      the Iranian Transaction Regulations. These regulations prohibit United States
      citizens, including United States corporations and other United States business
      organizations, from engaging in commercial, financial, or trade transactions
      with Iran, unless authorized by OFAC or exempted by statute. Our 2001 written
      response to OFAC stated that we believed that we were in compliance with
      applicable sanction regulations. In the first quarter of 2004, we responded
      to a
      follow-up letter from OFAC requesting additional information. We understand
      this
      matter has now been referred by OFAC to the DOJ. In July 2004, we received
      a
      grand jury subpoena from an Assistant United States District Attorney requesting
      the production of documents. We are cooperating with the government’s
      investigation and responded to the subpoena by producing documents in September
      2004.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts related to this
      investigation.

Separate
      from the OFAC inquiry, we completed a study in 2003 of our activities in Iran
      during 2002 and 2003 and concluded that these activities were in compliance
      with
      applicable sanction regulations. These sanction regulations require isolation
      of
      entities that conduct activities in Iran from contact with United States
      citizens or managers of United States companies. Notwithstanding our conclusions
      that our activities in Iran were not in violation of United States laws and
      regulations, we announced that, after fulfilling our current contractual
      obligations within Iran, we intend to cease operations within that country
      and
      withdraw from further activities there.

David
      Hudak and International Hydrocut Technologies Corp.

In
      October 2004, David Hudak and International Hydrocut Technologies Corp.
      (collectively, Hudak) filed suit against us in the United States District Court
      alleging civil Racketeer Influenced and Corporate Organizations Act violations,
      fraud, breach of contract, unfair trade practices, and other torts. The action,
      which seeks unspecified damages, arises out of Hudak’s alleged purchase from us
      in early 1994 of certain explosive charges that were later alleged by the DOJ
      to
      be military ordnance, the possession of which by persons not possessing the
      requisite licenses and registrations is unlawful. As a result of that allegation
      by the government, Hudak was charged with, but later acquitted of, certain
      criminal offenses in connection with his possession of the explosive charges.
      As
      mentioned above, the alleged transaction(s) took place more than 10 years ago.
      The fact that most of the individuals that may have been involved, as well
      as
      the entities themselves, are no longer affiliated with us will complicate our
      investigation. For those reasons and because the litigation is in its most
      preliminary stages, it is premature to assess the likelihood of an adverse
      result. We filed a motion to dismiss and, alternatively, a motion to transfer
      venue. Those motions were denied during the first quarter of 2006. It is our
      intention to vigorously defend this action.

Amounts
      accrued related to this matter as of December 31, 2006 were not
      material.

Iraq
      overtime litigation

During
      the fourth quarter of 2005, a group of present and former employees working
      on
      the LogCAP contract in Iraq and elsewhere filed a class action lawsuit alleging
      that KBR wrongfully failed to pay time and a half for hours worked in excess
      of
      40 per work week and that “uplift” pay, consisting of a foreign service bonus,
      an area


differential,
      and danger pay, was only applied to the first 40 hours worked in any work week.
      The class alleged by plaintiffs consists of all current and former employees
      on
      the LogCAP contract from December 2001 to present. The basis of plaintiffs’
claims is their assertion that they are intended third-party beneficiaries
      of
      the LogCAP contract, and that the LogCAP contract obligated KBR to pay time
      and
      a half for all overtime hours. We moved to dismiss the case on a number of
      bases. On September 26, 2006, the court granted the motion to dismiss insofar
      as
      claims for overtime pay and “uplift” pay are concerned, leaving only a
      contractual claim for miscalculation of employees’ pay. That claim remains open.
      It is premature to assess the probability of an adverse result on that remaining
      claim. However, because the LogCAP contract is cost-reimbursable, we believe
      that we could charge any adverse award to the customer. It is our intention
      to
      continue to vigorously defend the remaining claim.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts related to this
      matter.

McBride
      qui tam suit

In
      September 2006, we became aware of a

qui
      tam

action
      filed against us by a former employee alleging various wrongdoings in the form
      of overbillings of our customer on the LogCAP III contract. This case was
      originally filed pending the government’s decision whether or not to participate
      in the suit. In June 2006, the government formally declined to participate.
      The
      principal allegations are that our compensation for the provision of Morale,
      Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities under LogCAP III is based on the volume
      of usage of those facilities and that we deliberately overstated that usage.
      In
      accordance with the contract, we charged our customer based on actual cost,
      not
      based on the number of users. It was also alleged that during the period from
      November 2004 into mid-December 2004, we continued to bill the customer for
      lunches, although the dining facility was closed and not serving lunches. There
      are also allegations regarding housing containers and KBR’s provision of
      services to its own employees and contractors. Our investigation is ongoing.
      However, we believe the allegations to be without merit, and we intend to
      vigorously defend this action.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts in connection with this
      matter.

Wilson
      and Warren qui tam suit

During
      November 2006, we became aware of a

qui
      tam

action
      filed against us alleging that we overcharged the military $30 million by
      failing to adequately maintain trucks used to move supplies in convoys and
      by
      sending empty trucks in convoys. It was alleged that the purpose of these acts
      was to cause the trucks to break down more frequently than they would if
      properly maintained and to unnecessarily expose them to the risk of insurgent
      attacks, for the purpose of necessitating their replacement thus increasing
      our
      revenue. The suit also alleges that in order to silence the plaintiffs, who
      allegedly were attempting to report those allegations and other alleged
      wrongdoing, we unlawfully terminated them. On February 6, 2007, the court
      granted our motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ qui tam claims as legally
      insufficient and ordered the plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims that they
      were
      unlawfully discharged.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts in connection with this
      matter.

M-I,
      LLC antitrust litigation

On
      February 16, 2007, we were informed that M-I, LLC, a competitor of ours in
      the
      drilling fluids market has sued us for allegedly attempting to monopolize the
      market for invert emulsion drilling fluids used in deep water and/or in cold
      water temperatures. The claims M-I asserts are based upon its allegation that
      the patent issued for our Accolade® drilling fluid was invalid as a result of
      its allegedly having been procured by fraud on the United States Patent and
      Trademark Office and that our subsequent prosecution of an infringement action
      against M-I amounted to predatory conduct in violation of Section 2 of the
      Sherman Antitrust Act. In October 2006, a federal court dismissed our
      infringement action based upon its holding that the claims in our patent were
      indefinite and the patent was, therefore, invalid. That judgment is now on
      appeal. M-I also alleges that we falsely advertised our Accolade® drilling fluid
      in violation of the Lanham Act and California law and that our earlier
      infringement action amounted to malicious prosecution in violation of Texas
      state law. M-I seeks compensatory damages, which it claims should be trebled,
      as
      well as punitive damages and injunctive relief. We believe that M-I’s claims are
      without merit and intend to aggressively defend them.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had not accrued any amounts in connection with this
      matter.


Environmental

We
      are
      subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related
      to
      our operations worldwide. In the United States, these laws and regulations
      include, among others:

-

the
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
                Act;

-

the
                Resources Conservation and Recovery
                Act;

-

the
                Clean Air Act;

-

the
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
                and

-

the
                Toxic Substances Control Act.

In
      addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
      we do business often have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
      requirements by which we must abide. We evaluate and address the environmental
      impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties
      in
      order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental, legal, and
      regulatory requirements. On occasion, we are involved in specific environmental
      litigation and claims, including the remediation of properties we own or have
      operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance-related matters.
      Our
      Health, Safety and Environment group has several programs in place to maintain
      environmental leadership and to prevent the occurrence of environmental
      contamination.

We
      do not
      expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
      operations. Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were $43 million
      as of December 31, 2006 and $50 million as of December 31, 2005. The liability
      covers numerous properties and no individual property accounts for more than
      $5
      million of the liability balance. We have subsidiaries that have been named
      as
      potentially responsible parties along with other third parties for 12 federal
      and state superfund sites for which we have established a liability. As of
      December 31, 2006, those 12 sites accounted for approximately $10 million of
      our
      total $43 million liability. In some instances, we have been named a potentially
      responsible party by a regulatory agency, but in each of those cases, we do
      not
      believe we have any material liability.

Letters
      of credit

In
      the
      normal course of business, we have agreements with banks under which
      approximately $1.0 billion of letters of credit or bank guarantees were
      outstanding as of December 31, 2006, including $676 million that relate to
      KBR.
      These KBR letters of credit or bank guarantees include $516 million that relate
      to their joint ventures’ operations. Some of the outstanding letters of credit
      have triggering events which would entitle a bank to require cash
      collateralization.

Other
      commitments

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had commitments to fund approximately $156 million to
      related companies. These commitments arose primarily during the start-up of
      these entities or due to losses incurred by them. We expect approximately $13
      million of the commitments to be paid during the next twelve
      months.

Liquidated
      damages

Many
      of
      our engineering and construction contracts have milestone due dates that must
      be
      met or we may be subject to penalties for liquidated damages if claims are
      asserted and we were responsible for the delays. These generally relate to
      specified activities within a project by a set contractual date or achievement
      of a specified level of output or throughput of a plant we construct. Each
      contract defines the conditions under which a customer may make a claim for
      liquidated damages. However, in most instances, liquidated damages are not
      asserted by the customer, but the potential to do so is used in negotiating
      claims and closing out the contract. We had not accrued for liquidated damages
      of $43 million at December 31, 2006 and $70 million at December 31, 2005
      (including our share of amounts related to unconsolidated subsidiaries) that
      we
      could incur based upon completing the projects as forecasted.

Leases

We
      are
      obligated under operating leases, principally for the use of land, offices,
      equipment, field facilities, and warehouses. Total rentals, net of sublease
      rentals, were as follows:

The
      major
      component of the difference between the 2005 statutory tax rate compared to
      the
      effective tax rate is the release of a valuation allowance established in prior
      years. The remaining valuation allowance was released in 2006.


We
      generally do not provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
      non-United States subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be
      reinvested indefinitely to finance foreign activities. Taxes are provided as
      necessary with respect to earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The
      American Job Creations Act of 2004 introduced a special dividends received
      deduction with respect to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
      United States taxpayer under certain circumstances. Based on our analysis of
      the
      Act, we decided not to utilize the special deduction.

The
      primary components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related
      valuation allowances, including deferred tax accounts associated with
      discontinued operations, were as follows:

We
      have
      $187 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that expire from 2007
      through 2016 and additional foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $65
      million with indefinite expiration dates. During 2005, our existing deferred
      tax
      asset related to asbestos and silica liabilities became a United States net
      operating loss, due to the tax deduction of the related costs in 2005. As a
      result, a domestic net operating loss carryforward of $2.1 billion was created
      and was fully utilized in 2006. The federal alternative minimum tax credits
      are
      available to reduce future United States federal income taxes on an indefinite
      basis.

We
      have
      established a valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers and
      certain foreign operating loss carryforwards on the basis that we believe these
      assets will not be utilized in the statutory carryover period.

We
      had
      recorded a valuation allowance based on the anticipated impact of the United
      States net operating loss generated from asbestos and silica deductions on
      our
      ability to utilize future foreign tax credits in the United States. This
      valuation allowance was reassessed quarterly based on a number of estimates
      including future creditable foreign taxes and future taxable income. Factors
      such as actual operating results, material acquisitions or


dispositions,
      and changes to our operating environment could alter the estimates, which could
      have a material impact on the valuation allowance. For example, as a result
      of
      our strong 2005 earnings, coupled with an upward revision in our estimate of
      future domestic taxable income for 2006 and beyond, we recorded favorable
      adjustments to this valuation allowance in 2005. Given that we fully utilized
      the United States net operating loss in 2006 and expect to begin utilizing
      foreign tax credits in the United States for 2007, the valuation allowance
      balance has been reduced to zero as of the end of 2006.

In
      May
      2006, the shareholders increased the number of authorized shares of common
      stock
      to two billion. Also in May 2006, our Board of Directors finalized the terms
      of
      a two-for-one common stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend.
      As a
      result, the split was paid in the form of a stock dividend on July 14, 2006
      to
      shareholders of record on June 23, 2006. The effect on the balance sheet was
      to
      reduce “Paid-in capital in excess of par value” by $1.3 billion and to increase
“Common shares” by $1.3 billion. All prior period common stock and applicable
      share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted to reflect the
      split.

In
      February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up
      to
      $1.0 billion, which replaced our previous share repurchase program. In September
      2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our existing common share
      repurchase program of up to an additional $2.0 billion. The stock repurchase
      program does not require a specific number of shares to be purchased and the
      program may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the
      market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated
      or
      suspended at any time. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 40 million
      shares of our common stock for approximately $1.3 billion or an average price
      per share of $32.93.


Preferred
      Stock

Our
      preferred stock consists of five million total authorized shares at December
      31,
      2006, of which none were issued.

Halliburton
      Stock Incentive Plans

Our
      Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended (1993 Plan), provides for the grant of
      any
      or all of the following types of stock-based awards:

-

stock
                options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
                options;

-

restricted
                stock awards;

-

restricted
                stock unit awards;

-

stock
                appreciation rights; and

-

stock
                value equivalent awards.

There
      are
      currently no stock appreciation rights or stock value equivalent awards
      outstanding.

Under
      the
      terms of the 1993 Plan, 98 million shares of common stock have been reserved
      for
      issuance to employees and non-employee directors. The plan specifies that no
      more than 32 million shares can be awarded as restricted stock. At December
      31,
      2006, approximately 20 million shares were available for future grants under
      the
      1993 Plan, of which approximately 11 million shares remained available for
      restricted stock awards. The stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an
      award under the 1993 Plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or
      treasury shares.

In
      addition to the provisions of the 1993 Plan, we also have stock-based
      compensation provisions under our Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee
      Directors and our ESPP.

Once
      Halliburton's ownership interest in KBR, Inc. is 20% or less, outstanding awards
      to KBR, Inc. employees of options to purchase Halliburton stock and unvested
      Halliburton restricted stock under the 1993 Plan will be converted into similar
      KBR, Inc. awards under its new Transitional Stock Adjustment Plan, with the
      intention of preserving approximately the equivalent value of the previous
      awards under the 1993 Plan.

Each
      of
      the active stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed
      below.

Stock
      options

All
      stock
      options under the 1993 Plan are granted at the fair market value of our common
      stock at the grant date. Employee stock options vest ratably over a three-
      or
      four-year period and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Stock
      options granted to non-employee directors vest after six months. Compensation
      expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis
      over
      the entire vesting period. No further stock option grants are being made under
      the stock plans of acquired companies.

The
      following table represents our stock options activity during 2006, and includes
      exercised, forfeited, and expired shares from our acquired companies’ stock
      plans.


The
      total
      intrinsic value of options exercised was $123 million in 2006, $194 million
      in
      2005, and $19 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there was $37 million
      of
      unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
      nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
      average period of approximately 1.8 years.

Cash
      received from option exercises was $159 million during 2006, $342 million during
      2005, and $63 million during 2004. The tax benefit realized from the exercise
      of
      stock options was $42 million in 2006.

Restricted
      stock

Restricted
      shares issued under the 1993 Plan are restricted as to sale or disposition.
      These restrictions lapse periodically over an extended period of time not
      exceeding 10 years. Restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other
      conditions in accordance with our established policies. Upon termination of
      employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to
      us,
      resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock
      on
      the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight line basis
      over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Our
      Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Directors Plan) allows for
      each non-employee director to receive an annual award of 800 restricted shares
      of common stock as a part of compensation. These awards have a minimum
      restriction period of six months and the restrictions lapse upon termination
      of
      Board service. The fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is
      amortized. We reserved 200,000 shares of common stock for issuance to
      non-employee directors, which may be authorized but unissued common shares
      or
      treasury shares. At December 31, 2006, 106,400 shares had been issued to
      non-employee directors under this plan. There were 8,000 shares, 6,400 shares,
      and 8,000 shares of restricted stock awarded under the Directors Plan in 2006,
      2005, and 2004. In addition, during 2006, our non-employee directors were
      awarded 30,168 shares of restricted stock under the 1993 Plan, which are
      included in the table below.

The
      following table represents our 1993 Plan and Directors Plan restricted stock
      awards and restricted stock units granted, vested, and forfeited during

      was $64 million, during 2005 was $49 million, and during 2004 was $24 million.
      As of December 31, 2006, there was $139 million of unrecognized compensation
      cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock,
      which
      is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.3
      years.

      Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under
      the
      ESPP, eligible employees may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, subject
      to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. Unless
      the Board of Directors shall determine otherwise, each six-month offering period
      commences on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The price at which common stock
      may be purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
      value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each
      offering period. Under this plan, 24 million shares of common stock have been
      reserved for issuance. They may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury
      shares. As of December 31, 2006, 11.7 million shares have been sold through
      the
      ESPP.


KBR,
      Inc. Stock Incentive Plans

In
      November 2006, KBR, Inc. established the KBR 2006 Stock and Incentive Plan
      (KBR
      2006 Plan) which provides for the grant of any or all of the following types
      of
      KBR, Inc. stock-based awards:

-

stock
                options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
                options;

-

stock
                appreciation rights, in tandem with stock options or
                freestanding;

-

stock

Under
      the
      terms of the KBR 2006 Plan, 10 million shares of KBR, Inc. common stock have
      been reserved for issuance to KBR, Inc. employees and non-employee directors.
      The plan specifies that no more than 3.5 million KBR, Inc. shares can be awarded
      as restricted stock or restricted stock units or pursuant to performance awards.
      At December 31, 2006, approximately 8 million KBR, Inc. shares were available
      for future grants under the KBR 2006 Plan, of which approximately 2.5 million
      KBR, Inc. shares remained available for restricted stock awards or restricted
      stock unit awards.

Stock
      Options

Under
      the
      KBR 2006 Plan, effective as of the closing date of the KBR, Inc. initial public
      offering, stock options are granted with an exercise price not less than the
      fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant and a term no
      greater than 10 years. The term and vesting periods are established at the
      discretion of the Compensation Committee at the time of each grant.

KBR,

      options outstanding at December 31, 2006 had a weighted average remaining
      contractual life of 9.9 years. None of the options outstanding were exercisable
      at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, net of estimated forfeitures,
      there was $8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
      KBR,
      Inc. stock options, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period
      of
      approximately 2.9 years. The aggregate intrinsic value attributable to these
      options was $4 million as of December 31, 2006.

Restricted
      stock and restricted stock units

Restricted
      shares issued under the KBR 2006 Plan are restricted as to sale or disposition.
      These restrictions lapse periodically over a period not exceeding 10 years.
      Restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in
      accordance with our established policies. Upon termination of employment, shares
      on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to KBR, Inc. resulting
      in
      restricted stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock on the date
      of
      grant is amortized and ratably charged to income over the period during which
      the restrictions lapse.

Note
      16. Income (Loss) per Share

Basic
      income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding during the period and, effective January 1, 2005, includes the
      million shares that were contributed to the trusts established for the benefit
      of asbestos claimants. Diluted income (loss) per share includes additional
      common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with
      a
      dilutive effect had been issued. A reconciliation of the number of shares used
      for the basic and diluted income (loss) per share calculation is as
      follows:

In
      December 2004, we entered into a supplemental indenture that requires us to
      satisfy our conversion obligation for our convertible senior notes in cash,
      rather than in common stock, for at least the aggregate principal amount of
      the
      notes. This reduced the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include
      the conversion premium, which is the difference between the conversion price
      per
      share of common stock and the average share price. See the table above for
      the
      dilutive effect for 2006 and 2005. The conversion price of $18.825 per share
      of
      common stock was greater than our average share price in 2004 and, consequently,
      did not result in dilution.

Excluded
      from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share were options to purchase
      two million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2006, two million
      shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2005, and 18 million shares
      of
      common stock outstanding in 2004. These options were outstanding during these
      years but were excluded because the option exercise price was greater than
      the
      average market price of the common shares.


Note
      17. Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Foreign
      exchange risk

Techniques
      in managing foreign exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign
      currency borrowing and investing and the use of currency derivative instruments.
      We selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign exchange losses
      considering current market conditions, future operating activities, and the
      associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. The purpose of our
      foreign currency risk management activities is to protect us from the risk
      that
      the eventual dollar cash flows resulting from the sale and purchase of services
      and products in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in
      exchange rates.

We
      manage
      our currency exposure through the use of currency derivative instruments as
      it
      relates to the major currencies, which are generally the currencies of the
      countries in which we do the majority of our international business. These
      contracts generally have an expiration date of two years or less. Forward
      exchange contracts, which are commitments to buy or sell a specified amount
      of a
      foreign currency at a specified price and time, are generally used to manage
      identifiable foreign currency commitments. Forward exchange contracts and
      foreign exchange option contracts, which convey the right, but not the
      obligation, to sell or buy a specified amount of foreign currency at a specified
      price, are generally used to manage exposures related to assets and liabilities
      denominated in a foreign currency. None of the forward or option contracts
      are
      exchange traded. While derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in
      value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying
      exposures being managed. The use of some contracts may limit our ability to
      benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Foreign
      currency contracts are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies
      due
      primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded
      currencies). We attempt to manage our working capital position to minimize
      foreign currency commitments in non-traded currencies and recognize that pricing
      for the services and products offered in these countries should cover the cost
      of exchange rate devaluations. We have historically incurred transaction losses
      in non-traded currencies.

Assets,
      liabilities, and forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign
      currencies.

We
      utilize the derivative instruments described above to manage the foreign
      currency exposures related to specific assets and liabilities that are
      denominated in foreign currencies; however, we have not elected to account
      for
      these instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Additionally, we utilize
      the derivative instruments described above to manage forecasted cash flows
      denominated in foreign currencies generally related to long-term engineering
      and
      construction projects. Beginning in 2003, we designated these contracts related
      to engineering and construction projects as cash flow hedges. The ineffective
      portion of these hedges was included in operating income in the accompanying
      consolidated statements of operations and was not material in 2006, 2005, or
      2004. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains and unrealized losses
      on
      these cash flow hedges that were not material, and as of December 31, 2005,
      we
      had approximately $18 million in unrealized net losses on these cash flow
      hedges. We included these unrealized gains and losses on these cash flow hedges
      in other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
      We expect the unrealized net gains on these cash flow hedges to be reclassified
      into earnings within a year. Changes in the timing or amount of the future
      cash
      flows being hedged could result in hedges becoming ineffective, and, as a
      result, the amount of unrealized gain or loss associated with those hedges
      would
      be reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings. At December
      31,
      2006, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to
      the
      variability in future cash flows associated with foreign currency forecasted
      transactions is 12 months. The fair value of these contracts was not material
      as
      of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and was $27 million as of December
      31, 2004.

Notional
      amounts and fair market values.

The
      notional amounts of open forward contracts and option contracts were $489
      million at December 31, 2006 and $666 million at December 31, 2005. The notional
      amounts of our foreign exchange contracts do not generally represent amounts
      exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure or of
      the
      cash requirements related to these contracts. The amounts exchanged are
      calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the
      derivatives, such as exchange rates.


Credit
      risk

Financial
      instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are
      primarily cash equivalents, investments, and trade receivables. It is our
      practice to place our cash equivalents and investments in high quality
      securities with various investment institutions. We derive the majority of
      our
      revenue from our United States government contracts, primarily for projects
      in
      the Middle East, and from sales and services, including engineering and
      construction, to the energy industry. Within the energy industry, trade
      receivables are generated from a broad and diverse group of customers. There
      are
      concentrations of receivables in the United States and the United Kingdom.
      We
      maintain an allowance for losses based upon the expected collectibility of
      all
      trade accounts receivable. In addition, see Note 6 for discussion of United
      States government receivables.

There
      are
      no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty
      related to our derivative contracts. We select counterparties based on their
      profitability, balance sheet, and a capacity for timely payment of financial
      commitments, which is unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
      events.

Interest
      rate risk

We
      have
      several debt instruments outstanding that have both fixed and variable interest
      rates. We manage our ratio of fixed-rate to variable-rate debt through the
      use
      of different types of debt instruments and derivative instruments. As of
      December 31, 2006, we held no material interest rate derivative
      instruments.

Fair
      market value of financial instruments.

The
      estimated fair market value of long-term debt was $3.7 billion at December
      31,
      2006 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2005, as compared to the carrying amount
      of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2005.
      The
      $4.2 billion fair value at December 31, 2005 was previously reported
      as $2.9 billion.  In prior years, we did not
      consider the fair value of the conversion option in our convertible
      debentures.  The fair market value of fixed-rate long-term debt is based on
      quoted market prices for those or similar instruments. The carrying amount
      of
      variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair market value because these
      instruments reflect market changes to interest rates. The carrying amount of
      short-term financial instruments, cash and equivalents, receivables, short-term
      notes payable, and accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance
      sheets, approximates fair market value due to the short maturities of these
      instruments. The currency derivative instruments are carried on the balance
      sheet at fair value and are based upon third-party quotes.

Note
      18. Retirement Plans

Our
      company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number
      of
      our employees. These plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit
      plans, and other postretirement plans:

-

our
                defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return
                for
                services rendered. These plans provide an individual account for
                each
                participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the
                participant’s account are to be determined rather than the amount of
                pension benefits the participant is to receive. Contributions to
                these
                plans are based on pretax income and/or discretionary amounts determined
                on an annual basis. Our expense for the defined contribution plans
                for
                both continuing and discontinued operations totaled $184 million
                in 2006,
                $164 million in 2005, and $147 million in 2004. Additionally, we
                participate in a Canadian multi-employer plan to which we contributed
                $7
                million, $24 million, and $20 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
                respectively. The decrease in 2006 was attributable to a decrease
                in the
                number of employees due to the completion of a major project at the
                end of
                2005;

-

our
                defined benefit plans include both funded and unfunded pension plans,
                which define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually
                as a
                function of age, years of service, or compensation;
                and

-

our
                postretirement medical plans are offered to specific eligible employees.
                These plans are contributory. For some plans, our liability is limited
                to
                a fixed contribution amount for each participant or dependent. The
                plan
                participants share the total cost for all benefits provided above
                our
                fixed contributions. Participants’ contributions are adjusted as required
                to cover benefit payments. We have made no commitment to adjust the
                amount
                of our contributions; therefore, for these plans the computed accumulated
                postretirement benefit obligation amount is not affected by the expected
                future health care cost inflation
                rate.


In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      158 (SFAS No. 158), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
      Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
      132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to:

-

recognize
                on its balance sheet the funded status (measured as the difference
                between
                the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation) of pension
                and
                other postretirement benefit plans;

-

recognize,
                through comprehensive income, certain changes in the funded status
                of a
                defined benefit and postretirement plan in the year in which the
                changes
                occur;

-

measure
                plan assets and benefit obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
                year; and

-

disclose
                additional information.

We
      adopted the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and
      the
      additional disclosure requirements as of December 31, 2006.

The
      requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of
      the
      employer’s fiscal year-end is effective for fiscal years ending after December
      15, 2008 and we will adopt these requirements at that time.

Dresser
      Retiree Medical

Through
      2003, we were responsible for the majority of the costs for the Dresser Retiree
      Medical Plan. An amendment was made to this plan at the end of 2003 to limit
      our
      share of the costs and eventually eliminate the plan in 2005. We presented
      the
      impact of this amendment in our 2003 notes to consolidated financial statements,
      which reduced our projected benefit obligation by $86 million and increased
      our
      unrecognized prior service benefit by the same amount, with no impact to our
      balance sheet or statement of operations. In December 2004, the United States
      District Court ruled that we must continue to maintain the Dresser Retiree
      Medical Plan as we had in the past. We revised our 2003 presentation of the
      projected benefit obligation and unrecognized prior service benefit to reflect
      the plan at its pre-amendment amounts. We also adjusted our annual
      postretirement benefit expense by $13 million in the fourth quarter of
      2004.

Assumed
      long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit
      obligations, and rates of compensation increases vary for the different plans
      according to the local economic conditions. The weighted average assumptions
      for
      the Nigerian and Indonesian plans are not included in the above tables as the
      plans were immaterial. The discount rate was determined based on the rates
      of
      return of high-quality fixed income investments as of the measurement date.
      For
      our United Kingdom pension plans, which constitute 95% of our international
      pension plans’ projected benefit obligation, the discount rate was determined by
      comparing the terms of the plans to the yield curve of a portfolio of high
      quality debt instruments at the measurement date, and was 5.0% at September
      30,
      2006. The discount rate for 2005 was based on the annualized yield of the iBoxx
      AA corporate bonds, and was 5.0% at September 30, 2005.

The
      overall expected long-term rate of return on assets was determined based upon
      an
      evaluation of our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into
      account current and expected market conditions.

Our
      investment strategy varies by country depending on the circumstances of the
      underlying plan. Typically, less mature plan benefit obligations are funded
      by
      using more equity securities, as they are expected to achieve long-term growth
      while exceeding inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded
      using
      more fixed income securities, as they are expected to produce current income
      with limited volatility. Risk management practices include the use of multiple
      asset classes and investment managers within each asset class for
      diversification purposes. Specific guidelines for each asset class and
      investment manager are implemented and monitored.

We
      reduced our additional minimum pension liability by $72 million in 2005, of
      which $54 million was recorded as “Other comprehensive income.” The additional
      minimum liability was equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation
      over plan assets and accrued liabilities. A corresponding amount was recognized
      as either an intangible asset or a change to accumulated other comprehensive
      income.

The
      impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our consolidated balance sheet was to
      increase (decrease) certain accounts, as it relates to pension and other
      postretirement benefits, as follows:

Amounts
      recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income were as
      follows:


Expected
      cash flows

Contributions.

Funding
      requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country
      where such plan resides. In certain countries the funding requirements are
      mandatory, while in other countries they are discretionary. We currently expect
      to contribute $80 million to our international pension plans in 2007. For our
      domestic plans, we expect our contributions to be no more than $4 million in
      2007. We do not have a required minimum contribution for our domestic plans;
      however, we may make additional discretionary contributions, which will be
      determined after the actuarial valuations are complete.

The
      majority of our postretirement benefit plans are not subjected to risk
      associated with fluctuations in the medical trend rates because the company
      subsidy is capped. However, for one plan in which the company subsidy is not
      capped, the assumed health care cost trend rates could have an impact on the
      amounts reported for the total of such health care plans. A one-percentage-point
      change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following

The
      FASB
      issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
      an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (FIN 46), in January 2003. In December 2003,
      the FASB issued FIN 46R, a revision that supersedes the original interpretation.
      We adopted FIN 46R effective January 1, 2004.

FIN
      46R
      requires the consolidation of entities in which a company absorbs a majority
      of
      another entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the other entity’s
      expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual,
      or
      other financial interests in the other entity. Previously, entities were
      generally consolidated based upon a controlling financial interest through
      ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity.

The
      following details our variable interests in variable interest entities by
      business segment.

We
      perform many of our long-term energy-related construction projects through
      incorporated or unincorporated joint ventures. Typically, these ventures are
      dissolved upon completion of the project. Many of these ventures are funded
      by
      advances from the project owner and, accordingly, require no equity investment
      by the joint venture partners or shareholders. Occasionally, a venture incurs
      losses, which then requires funding by the joint venture partners or
      shareholders in proportion to their interest percentages. The ventures with
      little or no initial equity investment are considered variable interest
      entities. Our significant variable interest entities are:


Energy
      and Chemicals segment:

-

during
                2005, we formed a joint venture to engineer and construct a gas
                monetization facility. KBR owns a 50% equity interest and determined
                that
                we are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture which is consolidated
                for financial reporting purposes. At December 31, 2006 and December
                31, 2005, the joint venture had $756 million and $324 million in
                total
                assets and $877 million and $311 million in total liabilities,
                respectively. There are no consolidated assets that collateralize
                the
                joint venture’s obligations. However, at December 31, 2006 and December
                31, 2005, the joint venture had approximately $413 million and $173
                million of cash, respectively, which mainly relate to advanced billings
                in
                connection with the joint venture’s obligations under the EPC
                contract;

-

KBR
                has equity ownership in three joint ventures to execute EPC projects.
                KBR’s equity ownership ranges from 33% to 50%, and these joint ventures
                are considered variable interest entities. We are not the primary
                beneficiary and thus account for these joint ventures using the equity
                method of accounting. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
                these
                joint ventures had aggregate assets of $1 billion and $863 million
                and
                aggregate liabilities of $1.1 billion and $914 million, respectively.
                Our
                aggregate maximum exposure to loss related to these entities was
                $77
                million and $28 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005
                and is
                comprised of our equity investments in and advances to the joint
                ventures
                in addition to our commitment to fund any future
                losses;

-

we
                have an investment in a development corporation that has an indirect
                interest in the new Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC) ammonia
                plant project located in Egypt. We are performing the engineering,
                procurement, and construction (EPC) work for the project and operations
                and maintenance services for the facility. KBR owns 60% of this
                development company and consolidate it for financial reporting purposes
                within our Energy and Chemicals segment. The development corporation
                owns
                a 25% ownership interest in a company that consolidates the ammonia
                plant,
                which is considered a variable interest entity. The development
                corporation accounts for its investment in the company using the
                equity
                method of accounting. The variable interest entity is funded through
                debt
                and equity. We are not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest
                entity. As of December 31, 2006, the variable interest entity had
                total
                assets of $347 million and total liabilities of $199 million. Our
                maximum
                exposure to loss on our equity investments at December 31, 2006 is
                limited
                to our investment of $15 million and our commitment to fund an additional
                $3 million of stand-by equity. In August 2006, the lenders providing
                the
                construction financing notified EBIC that it was in default of the
                terms
                of its debt agreement, which effectively prevented the project from
                making
                additional borrowings until such time as certain security interests
                in the
                ammonia plant assets related to the export facilities, could be perfected.
                This default was cured on December 8, 2006 subject to submitting
                the
                remaining documentation in March 2007. Indebtedness under the agreement
                is
                non-recourse to us. No event of default has occurred pursuant to
                our EPC
                contract and we have been paid all amounts due from EBIC. In September
                2006, we were instructed by EBIC to cease work on one location of
                the
                project on which the ammonia storage tanks were originally planned
                to be
                constructed due to a decision to relocate the tanks. The new location
                has
                been selected and the client and its lenders have agreed to compensate
                KBR
                for approximately $6 million in costs resulting from the relocation
                of the
                storage tanks. We resumed work on the ammonia tanks in February 2007;
                and

-

in
                July 2006, KBR was awarded, through a 50%-owned joint venture, a
                contract
                with Qatar Shell GTL Limited to provide project management and
                cost-reimbursable engineering, procurement, and construction management
                services for the Pearl GTL project in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project,
                which is expected to be completed by 2011, consists of gas production
                facilities and a GTL plant. The joint venture is considered a variable
                interest entity. We consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
                purposes within our Energy and Chemicals segment because we are the
                primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2006, the Pearl joint venture
                had total assets of $66 million and total liabilities of $56
                million.


Government
      and Infrastructure segment:

-

during
                2001, we formed a joint venture, in which KBR owns a 50% equity interest
                with an unrelated partner, that owns and operates heavy equipment
                transport vehicles in the United Kingdom. This variable interest
                entity
                was formed to construct, operate, and service certain assets for
                a third
                party, and was funded with third party debt. The construction of
                the
                assets was completed in the second quarter of 2004, and the operating
                and
                service contract related to the assets extends through 2023. The
                proceeds
                from the debt financing were used to construct the assets and will
                be paid
                down with cash flow generated during the operation and service phase
                of
                the contract. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the
                joint
                venture had total assets of $161 million and $149 million and total
                liabilities of $147 million and $154 million, respectively. Our aggregate
                maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this
                joint
                venture is limited to our equity investment which was zero at December
                31,
                2006 and any future losses related to the operation of the assets.
                We are
                not the primary beneficiary. The joint venture is accounted for using
                the
                equity method of accounting;

-

KBR
                are involved in four privately financed projects, executed through
                joint
                ventures, to design, build, operate, and maintain roadways for certain
                government agencies in the United Kingdom. KBR has a 25% ownership
                interest in these joint ventures and account for them using the equity
                method of accounting. The joint ventures have obtained financing
                through
                third parties that is not guaranteed by us. These joint ventures
                are
                considered variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary
                beneficiary of these joint ventures and, therefore, account for them
                using
                the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2006, these joint
                ventures had total assets of $2.2 billion and total liabilities of
                $2.1
                billion. As of December 31, 2005, these joint ventures had total
                assets of
                $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $1.9 billion. Our maximum exposure
                to loss was $24 million at December 31, 2006. With respect to one
                of these
                roadways, we received a revised financial forecast during the second
                quarter of 2006, which takes into account sustained projected losses
                due
                to lower than anticipated long vehicle traffic and higher than forecasted
                lane availability deductions, which reduce project revenue. Because
                of
                this new information, we recorded an impairment charge of $10 million
                during the second quarter of 2006 in our equity investment in this
                roadway. As of December 31, 2006, our investment in this joint venture
                and
                the related company that performed the construction of the road was
                zero.
                In addition, at December 31, 2006, we had no additional funding
                commitments;

-

we
                participate in a privately financed project formed for operating
                and
                maintaining a railroad freight business in Australia. KBR owns 36.7%
                of
                the joint venture and operating company and we account for these
                investments using the equity method of accounting. These joint ventures
                are funded through senior and subordinated debt and equity contributions
                from the joint ventures’ partners. This joint venture has sustained losses
                since commencing operations due to lower than anticipated freight
                volume
                and a slowdown in the planned expansion of the Port of Darwin. At
                the end
                of the first quarter of 2006, the joint venture’s revised financial
                forecast led us to record a $26 million impairment charge. In October
                2006, the joint venture incurred an event of default under its loan
                agreement by failing to make an interest and principal payment. These
                loans are non-recourse to us. In light of the default, the joint
                venture’s
                need for additional financing, and the realization that the joint
                venture
                efforts to raise additional equity from third parties were not successful,
                we recorded an additional $32 million impairment charge in the third
                quarter of 2006. We will receive no tax benefit as this impairment
                charge
                is not deductible for Australian tax purposes. In December 2006,
                the
                senior lenders agreed to waive existing defaults and concede certain
                rights under the existing indenture. Among these were a reduction
                in the
                joint venture’s debt service reserve and the relinquishment of the right
                to receive principal payments for 27 months, through March 2009.
                In
                exchange for these concessions, the shareholders of the joint


venture
                committed approximately $12 million of new subordinated financing,
                of
                which $6 million was committed by us. These joint ventures are considered
                variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary
                of
                the joint ventures. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
                the
                joint venture had total assets of $874 million and $796 million and
                total
                liabilities of $790 million and $672 million, respectively. At December
                31, 2006, our maximum exposure to loss totaling $12 million is limited
                to
                our equity investments, senior operating notes, and equity owner
                notes;

-

we
                participate in a privately financed project executed through certain
                joint
                ventures formed to design, build, operate, and maintain a viaduct
                and
                several bridges in southern Ireland. The joint ventures were funded
                through debt and were formed with minimal equity. These joint ventures
                are
                considered variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary
                beneficiary of the joint ventures. KBR has up to a 25% ownership
                interest
                in the project’s joint ventures, and we are accounting for this interest
                using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2006 and
                December 31, 2005, the joint ventures had total assets of $301 million
                and
                $240 million and total liabilities of $293 million and $227 million,
                respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss was $8 million at December
                31,
                2006, and our share of any future losses resulting from the project.
                In
                addition, at December 31, 2006, we had remaining funding commitments
                of
                approximately $4 million; and

-

in
                April 2006, Aspire Defence, a joint venture between us, Mowlem Plc.
                and a
                financial investor, was awarded a privately financed project contract,
                the
                Allenby & Connaught project, by the MoD to upgrade and provide a range
                of services to the British Army’s garrisons at Aldershot and around
                Salisbury Plain in the United Kingdom. In addition to a package of
                ongoing
                services to be delivered over 35 years, the project includes a nine-year
                construction program to improve soldiers’ single living, technical and
                administrative accommodations, along with leisure and recreational
                facilities. Aspire Defence will manage the existing properties and
                will be
                responsible for design, refurbishment, construction and integration
                of new
                and modernized facilities. KBR indirectly owns a 45% interest in
                Aspire
                Defence, the project company that is the holder of the 35-year concession
                contract. In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in each of two joint
                ventures that provide the construction and the related support services
                to
                Aspire Defence. KBR’s performance through the construction phase is
                supported by $159 million in letters of credit and surety bonds totaling
                approximately $209 million as of December 31, 2006, both of which
                have
                been guaranteed by us. Furthermore, our financial and performance
                guarantees are joint and several, subject to certain limitations,
                with our
                joint venture partners. The project is funded through equity and
                subordinated debt provided by the project sponsors and the issuance
                of
                publicly held senior bonds. The entities we hold an interest in are
                considered variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary
                beneficiary of these entities. We account for our interests in each
                of the
                entities using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31,
                2006,
                the aggregate total assets and total liabilities of the variable
                interest
                entities were $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Our maximum
                exposure to project company losses as of December 31, 2006 was $59
                million. Our maximum exposure to construction and operating joint
                venture
                losses is limited to the funding of any future losses incurred by
                those
                entities.

Note
      20. Reorganization of Business Operations

Effective
      October 1, 2004, we restructured KBR into two segments, Government and
      Infrastructure and Energy and Chemicals. In 2004, we recorded restructuring
      and
      related costs of $40 million related to the reorganization. The total
      restructuring charges consisted of $31 million in personnel termination benefits
      and $9 million in impairment charges on technology-related assets. For the
      year
      ended December 31, 2004, $32 million of the restructuring charge was included
      in
“Cost of services” and $8 million was included in “General and administrative”
on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2005, all
      amounts related to the 2004 restructuring had been paid and the balance in
      the
      restructuring reserve account had been reduced to zero.


Note
      21. New Accounting Standards

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This
      interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
      recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
      Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes
      a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken
      or
      expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on
      derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
      periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective
      for
      fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We did not elect early adoption
      of this interpretation and adopted the provisions of FIN 48 beginning January
      1,
      2007. We have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of the January
      1,
      2007, adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected
      to
      have a significant impact on our financial position or results from operations.
      We expect that any adjustment to reduce beginning-of-year retained earnings
      will
      not exceed $40 million.

During
      September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108),
      “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
      Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statement”. SAB 108 provides guidance on
      how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should
      be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. This interpretation
      was effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The
      adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our financial position
      or results of operations.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON
      SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Halliburton
      Company:

Under
      date of February 26, 2007, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of
      Halliburton Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
      the
      related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
      flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006,
      which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection
      with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we
      also
      audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule (Schedule II)
      included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statement
      schedule is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
      is to express an opinion on this consolidated financial statement schedule
      based
      on our audits.

In
      our
      opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
      basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,
      in
      all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
      discussed in Notes 1 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial
      statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based
      compensation plans as of January 1, 2006, and its method of accounting for
      defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31,
      2006.
