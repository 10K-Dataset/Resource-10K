PART I

Item 1. Business.
         General Development of Business.  Halliburton Company's predecessor was
established in 1919 and incorporated  under the laws of the State of Delaware in
1924.  Halliburton  Company (the Company) provides energy services,  engineering
and  construction  services and  manufactures  products for the energy industry.
Information  related to acquisitions and dispositions is set forth in Note 14 to
the financial statements of this annual report.
         Financial Information About Business Segments. The Company is comprised
of  three  business  segments. See Note 2 to the  financial  statements  of this
annual  report for  financial information about these three business segments.
         Description of Services and Products.  The following is a summary which
briefly describes the Company's services and products for each business segment.
         The Energy Services Group segment provides a wide range of services and
products to provide both discrete services and products and integrated solutions
to customers in the  exploration,  development and production of oil and natural
gas. The Energy Services Group operates worldwide,  serving major oil companies,
independent   operators  and  national  oil  companies.   The  segment  includes
Halliburton  Energy Services (HES),  which offers pressure pumping equipment and
services,  logging and perforating  products and services,  drilling systems and
services,  drilling  fluid  systems,  drill  bits,  specialized  completion  and
production equipment and services and well control products and services;  Brown
& Root  Energy  Services,  which  provides  upstream  oil and  gas  engineering,
procurement and construction, project management and production services, subsea
construction,  fabrication and  installation of onshore and offshore  pipelines,
offshore and production  platforms,  marine engineering and other marine related
projects;  Landmark Graphics Corporation,  which provides integrated exploration
and production  information systems and professional  services;  and Halliburton
Energy  Development   (HED),  which  creates  business   opportunities  for  the
development,  production and operation of oil and gas fields in conjunction with
the Company's customers. In March 1999, HED was combined with HES.
         The Engineering and  Construction  Group segment  provides:  conceptual
design,  process  design,   detailed  engineering,   procurement,   project  and
construction  management;  construction  of chemical and  petrochemical  plants,
refineries,  liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas processing facilities, pulp and
paper mills, metal processing plants,  airports,  water and wastewater  systems;
technical  and  economic  feasibility  studies;  site  evaluation;   repair  and
refitting of submarines and surface ships;  operations and maintenance services,
and  engineering,  logistics and wastewater  management  services for commercial
industry, utilities and government customers.
         The Dresser  Equipment Group segment designs,  manufactures and markets
highly engineered products and systems for oil and gas producers,  transporters,
processors, distributors and users throughout the world. Products and systems of
this segment include compressors,  turbines, generators, electric motors, pumps,
engines and power  systems,  valves and controls,  instruments,  meters and pipe
couplings, blowers and gasoline dispensing systems.
         Markets and  Competition.  The  Company is one of the  world's  largest
diversified energy services and engineering and construction services companies.
The  Company's  services  and products  are sold in highly  competitive  markets
throughout  the world.  Competitive  factors  impacting  sales of the  Company's
services and products  are:  price,  service  (including  the ability to deliver
services and products on an "as needed,  where needed" basis),  product quality,
warranty  and  technical  proficiency.  A growing  number of  customers  are now
indicating a preference for integrated services and solutions.  These integrated
services  and solutions,  in the case of the Energy  Services  Group,  relate to
all phases of exploration,  development  and production of oil and  gas, and  in
the case  of the  Engineering and  Construction Group,  relate to  all phases of
design,  procurement,  construction  project  management  and  maintenance  of a
facility.  Demand for these types of  integrated services and solutions is based
primarily  upon  quality of  service, technical proficiency and value created.
         The Company conducts  business  worldwide in over 120 countries.  Since
the markets for the Company's  services and products are so large and cross many
geographic lines, a meaningful  estimate of the number of competitors  cannot be
made.  These markets are,  however,  highly  competitive  with many  substantial
companies  operating  in each  market.  Generally,  the  Company's  services and
products are marketed through its own servicing and sales organizations. A small




percentage of sales of the Energy Service Group's and Dresser  Equipment Group's
products is made by supply stores and third-party representatives.
         Operations  in some  countries  may be adversely  affected by unsettled
political conditions,  expropriation or other governmental actions, and exchange
control  and   currency   problems.   The  Company   believes   the   geographic
diversification  of its  business  activities  reduces the risk that loss of its
operations in any one country would be material to the conduct of its operations
taken as a whole.  Information  regarding  the  Company's  exposures  to foreign
currency  fluctuations,  risk  concentration  and financial  instruments used to
minimize risk is included in  management's  discussion and analysis of financial
condition  and results of  operations  under the caption  "Financial  Instrument
Market Risk" and in Note 15 to the financial statements of this annual report.
         Customers and Backlog. In 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively,  85%, 84%
and 81% of the  Company's  revenues  were  derived from the sale of products and
services to, including construction for, the energy industry.  Approximately 10%
of the total  backlog  at  December  31,  1998 was for  equipment  manufacturing
contracts.  The following  schedule  summarizes the backlog of  engineering  and
construction projects and equipment manufacturing contracts at December 31, 1998
and 1997:


         It is estimated  that 65% of the backlog  existing at December 31, 1998
will be completed  during 1999.  The Company's  backlog  excludes  contracts for
recurring hardware and software maintenance and support services. Backlog is not
necessarily  indicative of future operating  results because backlog figures are
subject to  substantial  fluctuations.  Arrangements  included in backlog are in
many instances  extremely complex,  nonrepetitive in nature and may fluctuate in
contract  value.  Many contracts do not provide for a fixed amount of work to be
performed and are subject to modification or termination by the customer. Due to
the size of certain  contracts,  the  termination or  modification of any one or
more  contracts or the addition of other  contracts may have a  substantial  and
immediate effect on backlog.
         Raw Materials.  Raw materials  essential to the Company's  business are
normally readily available.  Where the Company is dependent on a single supplier
for any materials  essential to its business,  the Company is confident  that it
could make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption
in the supply of such materials.
         Research,  Development  and  Patents.  The Company  maintains an active
research  and  development  program  to assist in the  improvement  of  existing
products and  processes,  the  development of new products and processes and the
improvement of engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs
of  its  customers.  Information  relating  to  expenditures  for  research  and
development is included in Note 1 and Note 2 to the financial statements of this
annual report.
         The  Company  owns  a  large  number  of  patents  and  has  pending  a
substantial  number  of  patent  applications   covering  various  products  and
processes.  The Company is also  licensed  under  patents  owned by others.  The
Company does not consider a particular patent or group of patents to be material
to the Company's business.
         Seasonality.  Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily  affect the
performance of the Company's services.  Winter months in the Northern Hemisphere
tend to affect operations negatively,  but the widespread geographical locations
of the  Company's  operations  serve to  mitigate  the  seasonal  nature  of the
Company's business.
         Employees.  At December 31, 1998, the  Company  employed  approximately
107,800 people.
         Regulation.  The Company is subject to  various environmental  laws and
regulations.  Compliance with such requirements has not  substantially increased
capital  expenditures,  adversely affected the Company's competitive position or



materially affected the Company's earnings.  The Company does not anticipate any
material  adverse  effects  in  the foreseeable  future  as a result of existing
environmental laws  and regulations.  Note  10 to the  financial  statements  of
this  annual  report   discusses  the Company's  involvement  as  a  potentially
responsible  party  in  the  remedial activities to clean up several "Superfund"
sites.

Item 2. Properties.
         Information  relating  to lease  payments is included in Note 10 to the
financial  statements  of this annual  report.  The  Company's  owned and leased
facilities, as described below, are suitable for their intended use.
         Energy  Services Group  manufacturing  facilities  owned by the Company
cover  approximately  4.9 million  square  feet.  Principal  locations  of these
manufacturing  facilities are Tulsa and Duncan,  Oklahoma;  Alvarado,  Amarillo,
Carrollton,  Dallas, Fort Worth, Garland, Longview, and Houston, Texas; Colorado
Springs,   Colorado;   Arbroath,   Scotland;   Reynosa,  Mexico;  Newcastle  and

owned by the Company cover approximately  550 acres in Belle Chasse,  Louisiana;
Greens Bayou, Texas; and Nigg and Wick, Scotland.  The Belle Chasse, facility is
leased to another company and  the  facility  in Nigg,  Scotland is  leased to a
joint  venture  of  the Company.  The  Energy  Services  Group  has  13 grinding
facilities owned or leased by the Company.  The  Energy Services  Group also has
mineral  rights  to  proven  and  prospective  reserves of barite and bentonite.
Such  rights  included  leaseholds  and  mining  claims  and  property owned  in
fee.  Based  on  the  number  of  tons  of  each of  the above minerals consumed
in fiscal 1998, the Company  estimates its  reserves,  which it considers to  be
proven,  to  be  sufficient  for  operations  for  the  foreseeable  future.  In
addition,  service  centers,  sales offices and field warehouses are operated at
approximately 290 locations in  the  United States,  almost  all  of  which  are
owned,  and at approximately 360 locations outside the United States in both the
Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
         Engineering  and  Construction   Group  fabricating   facilities  cover
approximately  468,000 square feet in Houston,  Texas and Edmonton,  Canada,  of
which 388,000 square feet in Houston is leased to another  company.  Engineering

project offices, field camps, service centers, and sales offices are operated at
approximately 10 locations  in the  United  States,  almost  all  of  which  are
owned,  and at approximately  15  locations  outside the United  States in both
the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
         Dresser  Equipment Group owns  approximately 9.9 million square feet of
manufacturing  facilities.  Major  sites are  in Austin,  Stafford and  Houston,

5,500 square feet of space in Washington,  D.C.  The  Company owns approximately
1 million square feet of  office and  campus  space  in  Houston, Texas which is
occupied  by  multiple business  units and  shared  services  groups who conduct
administrative, procurement, and engineering design activities. These activities
are carried on in leased facilities covering approximately  100,000 square  feet
in Surrey and Eastleigh, England. The Company also  owns  approximately  203,000
square  feet of  office and campus  space in Leatherhead, England where multiple
business units and  shared services groups conduct  administrative,  procurement
and  engineering design activities.
         Due to  the  acquisition  (the  Merger)  of  Dresser  Industries,  Inc.
(Dresser), and in response to the industry downturn due to declining oil and gas
prices,  the  Company  has  certain  manufacturing,  administrative  and service
support  facilities that are no longer fully  utilized.  The Company has enacted
plans to vacate facilities that are now considered  excess. In 1998, the Company
recorded  facility  consolidation  charges of $126.2  million to provide for the
costs to dispose of owned  properties or exit leased  facilities.  See Note 7 to
the annual consolidated  financial statements for additional  information on the
facility consolidations.

                               HALLIBURTON COMPANY
         Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
                             Results of Operations

HALLIBURTON / DRESSER MERGER
         On  September  29,  1998,  the  acquisition  (the  Merger)  of  Dresser
Industries,  Inc.  (Dresser)  by the  Company  was  completed.  The  Merger  was
accounted for using the pooling of interests  method of accounting  for business
combinations. Accordingly, the Company's financial statements have been restated
to include the results of Dresser for all periods presented.  See Note 14 to the
annual consolidated  financial  statements.  Prior to the Merger,  Dresser was a
diversified  company  with  operations  in three  business  segments:  Petroleum
Products and Services;  Engineering Services; and Energy Equipment. Prior to the
Merger, the Company operated in two business segments,  the Energy Group and the
Engineering  and  Construction  Group.  Following  the  Merger,  the  Company is
organized around three business segments: Energy Services Group; Engineering and
Construction Group; and Dresser Equipment Group.
         Management of the Company believes the Merger provides the Company with
the opportunity to better meet customer  needs,  to improve its  technology,  to
strengthen its product service lines, to cut costs,  and to position the Company
for the future.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
         The Company  operates in over 120 countries around the world to provide
a variety of energy services,  energy equipment and engineering and construction
services to energy, industrial and governmental customers. The industries served
by the  Company  are  highly  competitive,  with many  substantial  competitors.
Operations in some countries may be affected by unsettled political  conditions,
expropriation  or other  governmental  actions,  exchange  controls and currency
fluctuations.  The  Company  believes  the  geographic  diversification  of  its
business  activities  reduces  the risk that loss of its  operations  in any one
country would be material to its consolidated results of operations.
         The  majority of the  Company's  revenues  are derived from the sale of
services  and  products,   including  construction  activities,  to  the  energy
industry.  The Company offers a  comprehensive  range of integrated and discrete
services and  products,  as well as project  management  for oil and natural gas
activities  throughout  the  world.  The  decline  in oil and gas prices in 1998
caused a decrease in the worldwide average rotary drilling rig count and sharply
reduced demand for some of the Company's  products and services.  In response to
weakening demand in some areas of the world,  the Company has implemented  plans
to reduce the number of  employees  in those  geographic  areas  where  activity
levels  have  declined,   to  scale  back  discretionary   spending  on  capital
expenditures and to curtail discretionary travel and other expenses. The Company
has also taken steps to reduce its workforce and rationalize assets to eliminate
duplicate resources in connection with the Merger.
         Oil and gas prices,  global and regional  economic growth rates and the
resulting  demand for  products  created from  hydrocarbons  affect the spending
decisions   of  the   Company's   customers.   Despite  the   current   economic
uncertainties,   over  the  long  term  the  Company  believes  steadily  rising
population and greater  industrialization efforts will continue to propel global
growth,  particularly  in  developing  nations.  These  factors  will also cause
increasing  demand for oil and natural gas to supply  growing  needs for refined
products, petrochemicals, fertilizers, and power.
         Energy Services Group. During 1998,  particularly in the second half of
the  year,  the  energy  industry  experienced  a  downturn  brought  about by a
combination  of factors  that began in late 1997.  Decreased  demand in Asia for
crude  oil,  increases  in  production  from OPEC  producers,  added  production
increases from Iraq and  unseasonably  warm winters in North America during 1997
and 1998 all  contributed  to the  industry  downturn  experienced  during 1998.
Throughout  1998,  crude oil prices  varied from $4 to $8 per barrel  lower than
1997.  Equally  important,  oil prices were less than $15 per barrel for most of
1998,  particularly  during the second half of the year,  making  many  drilling
programs economically  infeasible.  Natural gas prices within the U.S., although
significantly  lower than 1997 levels,  remained  above $2 per million BTU until
the third quarter of 1998. During the third quarter of 1998,  natural gas prices
began a decline which,  combined with  additional  declines in crude oil prices,
resulted  in  further  reductions  in demand  for  hydrocarbon  exploration  and



development.  These  factors  negatively  impacted the industry and the Company.
Overall, the industry fundamentals in 1998 were significantly weaker than 1997.
         Integrated  business  solutions,   long  term  overseas  contracts  and
engineering and construction backlog benefited the Company's revenues throughout
1998 when  compared  to the  industry  fundamentals  and  worldwide  rig counts.
Continued  interest in deepwater  drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and projects in
the North Sea,  combined  with U.S.  natural gas prices above $2 per million BTU
benefited the industry during the first and second quarters of 1998. As industry
indicators  began to  significantly  weaken in the third  quarter  of 1998,  the
Company  started  implementing  actions  to  properly  align  its  resources  to
projected industry conditions.
         Although 1998 was a difficult year and 1999 will also be difficult, the
Company believes that long term industry  fundamentals will prevail.  Demand for
oil  and  natural  gas  worldwide  should  recover  and  grow.  Over  time,  the
accelerating depletion of existing production and the need for technologies that
make exploration and production economically feasible in the presence of low oil
and gas prices will provide growth opportunities.  The Company believes that its
customers  will  continue to seek  opportunities  to lower the  overall  cost of
exploring,  developing  and  enhancing  the  recovery  of  hydrocarbons  through
increased utilization of integrated solutions, application of new technology and
partnering  and alliance  arrangements.  The Company  believes  that it has good
opportunities to expand its revenues and profit through greater participation in
larger  projects that utilize its project  management  and  integrated  services
capabilities.   However,   uncertainty  exists  within  the  industry  into  the
foreseeable future.
         Engineering and Construction Group. While the Company has seen projects
delayed and cancelled in many of the areas that it serves,  the Company  expects
to see demand for its engineering and construction services continue to increase
over the long term.  The Company  believes  the key to increase its revenues and
improve profit margins in the current environment will be its ability to provide
total customer satisfaction. Today's competitive environment demands flexibility
and  innovation.  To  bring  more  value  to its  customers,  the  Company  must
demonstrate  its ability to partner with other service and  equipment  suppliers
and customers on larger projects, accept more project success risk through total
project responsibility or fixed price contracts,  broaden its core competencies,
acquire and fully utilize proprietary technology and manage costs. The Group has
determined  it  will  focus  on  demand  in the  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG),
fertilizer,  petroleum,  chemical and forest  products  industries in the United
States and  international  locations.  The Company also sees an expanding demand
for its  government  services  capabilities  in the United States and the United
Kingdom as governmental agencies,  including local government units, continue to
expand their use of outsourcing to improve service levels and manage costs.
         Dresser Equipment Group. Dresser Equipment Group's business activity is
primarily determined by activity levels within the energy industry. Products and
systems of Dresser Equipment Group include  compressors,  turbines,  generators,
electric motors, pumps, engines and power systems, valves,  instruments,  meters
and pipe  couplings,  blowers  and fuel  dispensing  systems.  Demand  for these
products is directly  affected by global  economic  activity,  which  influences
demand  for  transportation  fuels,   petrochemicals,   plastics,   fertilizers,
chemicals and  by-products  of oil and gas. The  conditions for sales of Dresser
Equipment Group products is highly competitive and its sales and earnings can be
affected by changes in competitive prices, fluctuations in the level of activity
in major industry areas, and general economic  conditions.  The group strives to
be the low cost provider in this competitive environment.
         Because  of the  impact  of  economic  and  political  conditions,  and
uncertainty  in many parts of the  world,  several  initiatives  are in place to
reduce capacity costs and improve  operating  performance.  The Company believes
strong demand still exists for products and services of Dresser Equipment Group.
The key to achieving  favorable  operating  results over the course of the year,
particularly in light of industry conditions, will rely to a great extent on the
ability of the group to leverage the customers currently served and leverage off
of the products and service offerings of other Halliburton  companies to be able
to provide integrated solutions to the expanded customer base.
         In the near term,  activity levels remain  uncertain.  In the long term
the  Company  believes  the  demand  for the  products  and  systems  of Dresser
Equipment  Group  will  increase  due to  rising  population  and  an  expanding
industrial base.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 1998 COMPARED TO 1997 AND 1996
REVENUES


         Revenues for 1998 were $17,353.1  million,  an increase of 7% over 1997
revenues of  $16,276.5  million  and an  increase  of 24% over 1996  revenues of
$13,946.6 million. Approximately 65% of the Company's consolidated revenues were
derived from international  activities in 1998 compared with 60% in 1997 and 59%
in 1996.
         Energy  Services  Group  revenues  were  $9,009.5  million for 1998, an
increase of 6% over 1997  revenues  of  $8,504.7  million and an increase of 38%
over 1996 revenues of $6,515.4 million.  Revenues in the first half of 1998 were
higher than  comparable  periods of the prior two years.  Revenues in the second
half of 1998 were  impacted by the steep  decline in activity as measured by the
worldwide  average  rotary rig count.  The yearly average  worldwide  rotary rig
count fell 13% in 1998 compared to 1997  (including a third quarter  comparative
decline of 21% and a fourth quarter  comparative decline of 30%) as customers of
the Energy Services Group reacted to reduced prices for their products. Revenues
for  pressure  pumping  activities  in 1998 were lower  than 1997 but  increased
compared to 1996. The decrease in pressure pumping  activities for 1998 compared
to 1997  occurred in the second half of 1998.  Other  product and service  lines
experienced  similar results in this time period.  The revenue  declines in 1998
compared to 1997 were more  pronounced in North  America,  including the Gulf of
Mexico shelf,  and  Venezuela.  Revenues  from upstream oil and gas  engineering
services increased in 1998 compared to 1997 and 1996, benefiting from activities
in subsea  product  lines and from  large  engineering  projects.  Revenues  for
integrated  exploration and production  information  systems reached record high
levels in 1998.  Approximately  67% of the Energy Services Group's revenues were
derived from international activities each year in 1998, 1997 and 1996.
         Engineering and  Construction  Group revenues were $5,494.8 million for
1998, an increase of 10% from 1997 revenues of $4,992.8  million and an increase
of 16% over 1996 revenues of $4,720.7 million.  The increase in revenues in 1998
reflects LNG activities in Asia and Africa,  an enhanced oil recovery project in
Africa,  and a major ethylene project in Singapore as well as increased revenues
in Asia/Pacific  from Kinhill,  which was acquired in the third quarter of 1997.
See Note 14 to the  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information. For 1998 compared to 1997, revenues were negatively impacted by the
sale of the environmental  services business in December 1997 and lower activity
levels for repair and  refitting  services for the British Royal Navy's fleet of
submarines and surface ships. For 1997 compared to 1996,  revenues were aided by
the consolidation of Devonport  Management  Limited as a result of the Company's
increased ownership percentage in that subsidiary.  See Note 14. Lower levels of
activity under service contracts with the U.S.  Department of Defense to provide
technical and logistical support for military peacekeeping  operations in Bosnia
resulted in revenue reductions of approximately  $290.0 million in 1997 compared
to 1996.
         Dresser  Equipment  Group  revenues were  $2,848.8  million in 1998, an
increase of 3% over 1997  revenues of  $2,779.0  million,  and an increase of 5%
over 1996 revenues of $2,710.5  million.  The  compression  and pumping and flow
control  product  lines  experienced  small  increases  in  revenues  while  the
measurement  and power  systems  product  lines  reported  a slight  decline  in
revenues for 1998  compared to 1997.  Most of the  increase in 1997  compared to
1996  came  from  the  compressor  joint  venture  with  Ingersoll-Rand  and the
measurement product lines.





         Operating  income was $396.5  million  for 1998  compared  to  $1,398.7
million  for 1997 and $903.2  million  for 1996.  Excluding  special  charges of
$980.1  million,  $16.2  million and $85.8 million  during 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively,  operating income for 1998 decreased by 3% from 1997 and increased
by 39% over  1996 as  shown in the  preceding  table.  See Note 7 to the  annual
consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information on the special
charges and credits.
         Energy  Services Group operating  income in 1998 was $971.0 million,  a
decrease of 5% from 1997 operating income of $1,019.4 million and an increase of
39% over 1996 operating income of $698.0 million.  Operating  margins were 10.8%
in 1998  compared  with 12.0% in 1997 and 10.7% in 1996.  Most of the decline in
operating  margins in 1998 compared to 1997 can be attributed to declines in the
completion  products and pressure  pumping lines,  to lower  activities in North
America and  Venezuela,  and to additional job loss  provisions  recorded in the
fourth quarter of 1998.  Approximately  54%, 59% and 63% of the Energy  Services
Group's  operating  income was derived from  international  activities for 1998,
1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Operating income for pressure pumping in 1998 was
about 10% lower than 1997 as activity  levels were  reduced in response to lower
oil and gas  prices.  Other  product  and  service  lines were also  impacted by
reduced   activity   levels  with  only  the  drilling   related   lines  having
significantly  better operating  results in 1998 over 1997.  Operating income in
1997 for the group benefited from increased activity levels and increased prices
charged to customers, especially for pressure pumping services in North America.
Operating  income for  drilling  fluids  increased  in 1997 over 1996 due to the
growth of more  technically  demanding wells being drilled,  particularly in the
Gulf of Mexico. Operating income for upstream oil and gas engineering activities
in 1998 was about  the same as 1997  results  even  after  providing  additional
provisions  for project  losses in the North Sea, North Africa and Latin America
related to variation orders for ongoing projects which the Company does not feel
will be accepted by the  customer  due to current  industry  conditions.  Energy
Services Group results for 1996 include $35.0 million of gain sharing revenue on
its portion of the cost savings realized on the BP Andrew alliance. The alliance
completed the project seven months ahead of the scheduled  production of oil and
achieved a $125.0 million  savings  compared with the targeted  cost.  Operating
income from pipecoating  activities were substantially improved in 1997 compared
to 1996 due to  higher  activity  levels in the Far  East,  Middle  East and the
United States.
         Engineering and Construction  Group operating income for 1998 of $237.2
million increased 8% over 1997 and 77% over 1996. Operating margins were 4.3% in
1998  compared  with 4.4% for 1997 and 2.8% for 1996.  Operating  income in 1998
includes a  favorable  settlement  of a claim on a Middle  Eastern  construction
project.  Excluding  this  settlement,  operating  margins  for 1998 were  4.0%.
Operating  income and margins in 1998 were negatively  affected by losses in the
fourth quarter on existing highway and paving business and for selected projects
which were  impacted by the  economic  downturn  in Asia.  The  Engineering  and
Construction Group has not started any new significant jobs in Asia. Improvement



in operating income in 1997 over 1996 was realized through overhead  reductions,
a focus on higher  margin  business  lines and the  consolidation  of  Devonport
Management Limited as a result of the Company's increased  ownership  percentage
in that subsidiary. See Note 14 to the annual consolidated financial statements.
The 1997 operating  income  improvements  over 1996 were aided by LNG activities
and oil  recovery  work in Africa  together  with  engineering  services for the
fertilizer industry in Latin America.  Operating income in 1996 included a $17.1
million charge for the impairment of the  Engineering and  Construction  Group's
investment in the Dulles Greenway toll road extension project.
         Dresser  Equipment Group operating income in 1998 was $247.8 million or
almost unchanged compared to 1997 operating income of $248.3 million.  Operating
income  for 1998  increased  8% over 1996  operating  income of $229.3  million.
Operating  income  was  negatively  impacted  in 1998 by $17  million  of fourth
quarter merger related  expenses.  Operating  income in 1998 for the compression
and  pumping  product  line  increased  compared  to 1997  due to  restructuring
initiatives instituted in late 1997 and increased revenues. Operating income for
the flow control product line improved in 1998 over 1997 from cost improvements,
better product mix, and increased  volume.  Operating income for the measurement
product line  decreased in 1998 due to weakness in the gas metering  business as
gas utilities  continued to work off their excess  inventory.  The power systems
product  line  operating  income  declined  in  1998  compared  to  1997  due to
customers'  reduced  capital  spending  caused  by  softer  demand  in  the  gas
compression and refining markets. Operating income increased in 1997 compared to
1996 primarily from the Ingersoll-Dresser Pump joint venture (profit improvement
initiatives started in prior years); Wayne fuel dispensing systems (introduction
of new technologies) and Energy Valve (improved margins and product mix).
         General  corporate  expenses  for 1998 were $79.4  million  and include
expenses  through  the  transition  after the  Merger  for  operating  Dresser's
corporate offices as well as Halliburton's  corporate  offices.  As a percent of
consolidated revenues,  general corporate expenses were 0.5% in 1998 compared to
0.4% in 1997 and 0.5% in 1996.

NONOPERATING ITEMS
         Interest expense was $136.8 million for 1998 compared to $111.3 million
in 1997 and $84.6 million in 1996.  The increase in 1998 over 1997 is due to the
increased  level  of  short-term  borrowings   outstanding  during  1998.  These
borrowings, which carry a lower interest rate than the Company's long-term debt,
were used for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures  and  acquisitions.  The
increase in 1997 over 1996 is due to the  issuance  of debt under the  Company's
medium-term note program in 1997 and a full year's interest on $300.0 million of
long-term  debentures  issued in August 1996 at a higher  interest rate than the
previous short-term debt.
         Interest  income  increased to $27.8  million in 1998 compared to $21.9
million in 1997 and $26.9 million in 1996. Interest income is typically a factor
of the levels of invested cash maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries.
         Foreign  currency gains  (losses)  netted to a loss of $12.4 million in
1998 compared to $0.7 million in 1997 and $19.1  million in 1996.  The losses in
1998 occurred mainly in Asia/Pacific currencies.  The 1996 losses were primarily
due to  devaluations  of the  Venezuelan  bolivar  and costs of hedging  foreign
exchange exposures of an Italian subsidiary.
         Provision  for income taxes was $244.4  million in 1998.  The provision
for income taxes in 1998 includes a benefit of $234.1 million for special charge
items that are tax  deductible.  Nondeductible  special  charge  items of $109.0
million include merger  transaction costs and  nondeductible  goodwill which was
determined  to be impaired.  Excluding  the special  charge and  applicable  tax
benefits in 1998, the effective tax rate was 38.0%. The 1997 provision of $491.4
million  was higher  than the 1996  provision  of $248.4  million due in part to
improved  earnings.  The effective  income tax rate was 37.4% in 1997,  compared
with 29.9% in 1996. The lower  effective  income tax rate and provision for 1996
are due to credits of $43.7 million recorded during the third quarter of 1996 to
recognize certain net operating loss carryforwards and the settlement of various
issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding the tax benefits recorded in
1996, the effective income tax rate for 1996 was 35.2%. See Note 6 to the annual
consolidated financial statements.
         Minority interest in net income of consolidated  subsidiaries was $49.1
million in 1998 compared to $49.3 million in 1997 and $24.7 million in 1996. The
increase  in 1997  over  1996 is due  primarily  to  Dresser  Equipment  Group's



ownership interests in Dresser-Rand and the Engineering and Construction Group's
ownership  interests in  Devonport  Management  Limited,  which  increased  from
approximately 30% to 51% during March 1997.
         Net  income  (loss)  for 1998 was a loss of $14.7  million  for a $0.03
diluted  loss per share.  In 1997 net  income of $772.4  million  yielded  $1.77
diluted income per share while 1996 net income of $557.9  million  yielded $1.29
diluted income per share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
         The  Company  ended 1998 with cash and  equivalents  of $202.6  million
compared  with  $384.1  million in 1997 and $446.0  million in 1996.  To conform
Dresser's fiscal year-end to  Halliburton's  calendar  year-end,  Dresser's cash
flows are measured from December 31, 1997, rather than from the October 31, 1997
balances included on the consolidated balance sheets.
         Cash flows from  operating  activities  were  $454.1  million  for 1998
compared to $833.1  million for 1997 and $864.2  million for 1996. In 1998,  the
primary  use of cash for  operating  activities  was to fund  increased  working
capital requirements.
         Cash flows used in investing  activities  were $846.1 million for 1998,
$873.3  million for 1997 and $759.1  million for 1996. The majority of cash used
for  investing  activities  during  1998 was for capital  expenditures.  Capital
expenditures  in 1998  increased  slightly over 1997 as the Company's  continued
investment in its enterprise-wide information systems initiative offset declines
in other  capital  spending.  Cash  used in  investing  activities  in 1997 also
includes the acquisitions of OGC of approximately $118.3 million, and Kinhill of
approximately $34.0 million,  and an interest in PES (International)  Limited of
approximately $33.6 million,  offset by the sale of the Company's  environmental
business for about $32.0 million. In 1996, investing activities included a $41.3
million  expenditure  for  the  Company's  share  of  the  purchase  price  of a
subsidiary acquired by the Company's former 36% owned affiliate, M-I L.L.C. Also
in 1996, several other acquisitions were made which used $32.2 million of cash.
         Cash flows from financing  activities  provided  $253.7 million in 1998
and used $20.6 million in 1997 and $148.4  million in 1996.  The Company  issued
$150.0  million of long-term  debt under its  medium-term  note program in 1998.
Also in 1998,  the  Company  had net  borrowings  of  short-term  debt of $369.3
million and proceeds from exercise of stock options of $49.1 million.  Dividends
to  shareholders  used $254.2  million of cash in 1998.  During  1997,  cash was
provided  by proceeds  from debt issued  under the  Company's  medium-term  note
program of $300.0  million plus $3.2 million of other  long-term  borrowings and
proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $71.5 million.  Offsetting  these
inflows were  payments on long-term  debt of $17.7  million,  net  repayments on
short-term  borrowings of $85.8 million,  payments to reacquire  common stock of
$44.1 million, and dividend payments of $250.3 million.  Cash used for financing
activities  during  1996  consisted  primarily  of  dividend  payments of $239.6
million and  payments to  reacquire  common  stock of $235.2  million  offset by
proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings  of $295.6  million and proceeds  from the
exercise of stock options of $42.6 million.  The Company's  combined  short-term
notes payable and long-term debt was 32%, 24% and 23% of total capitalization at
the end of 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
         The  Company  has the  ability  to  borrow  additional  short-term  and
long-term funds if necessary.  See Note 8 to the annual  consolidated  financial
statements  regarding the Company's  various  short-term lines of credit,  notes
payable and long-term debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK
         The Company is currently exposed to market risk from changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates, and to a lesser extent,  to changes in interest rates.
To mitigate  market risk, the Company  selectively  hedges its foreign  currency
exposure through the use of currency  derivative  instruments.  The objective of
such  hedging  is to  protect  the  Company's  cash  flows  related  to sales or
purchases of goods or services from fluctuations in currency rates.  Inherent in
the use of derivative  instruments are certain types of market risk:  volatility
of the currency rates, time horizon of the derivative instruments, market cycles
and the type of derivative instruments used. The Company does not use derivative
instruments  for  trading  purposes.  See  Note  1 to  the  annual  consolidated
financial  statements  for additional  information  on the Company's  accounting
policies  on  derivative  instruments.  See Note 15 to the  annual  consolidated
financial   statements   for  additional   disclosures   related  to  derivative
instruments.



         Foreign exchange. While the Company operates in over 120 countries, the
Company  hedges  only  foreign  currencies  that are highly  liquid and  selects
derivative  instruments  or a combination of  instruments  whose  fluctuation in
value is offset by the  fluctuation in value to the underlying  exposure.  These
hedges generally have expiration  dates that do not exceed two years.  Exposures
to certain  currencies  are  generally  not hedged due  primarily to the lack of
available markets or cost considerations  (non-traded  currencies).  The Company
manages its foreign exchange hedging  activities  through a control system which
includes monitoring of cash balances in traded currencies, analytical techniques
such as value at risk estimations, and other procedures.
         Interest  rates.  The Company  currently  has exposure to interest rate
risk from its  long-term  debt with interest  based on LIBOR for the U.K.  pound
sterling (GBP) plus 0.75% which was incurred in connection  with its acquisition
of the Royal Dockyard in Plymouth,  England (the Dockyard  Loans).  This risk is
partially  offset by a  compensating  balance of  approximately  one-half of the
outstanding  debt  amount  which  earns  interest at a rate equal to that of the
Dockyard Loans. The compensating  balance is restricted as to use by the Company
and is included in other assets on the Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets.
See  Note 8 to the  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
discussion of the Dockyard Loans.
         Value at risk.  The Company  uses a  statistical  model to estimate the
potential loss related to derivative  instruments  used to hedge the market risk
of its  foreign  exchange  exposure.  The model  utilizes  historical  price and
volatility   patterns  to  estimate  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative
instruments  which could occur from adverse  movements in foreign exchange rates
for a specified time period at a specified confidence interval.  The model is an
undiversified calculation based on the variance-covariance  statistical modeling
technique and includes all foreign exchange derivative  instruments  outstanding
at December 31, 1998.  The  resulting  value at risk of $2.8 million  estimates,
with a 95% confidence interval,  the potential loss the Company could incur in a
one-day  period from  foreign  exchange  derivative  instruments  due to adverse
foreign exchange rate changes.
         Interest rate  exposures.  The  following  table  represents  principal
amounts at December 31, 1998,  and related  weighted  average  interest rates by
year  of  maturity  for  the  Company's   restricted  cash  and  long-term  debt
obligations.  Other notes with varying  interest rates of $10.2 million as shown
in Note 8 to the annual consolidated  financial statements are excluded from the
following table.


         Weighted  average  variable rates are based on implied forward rates in
the yield curve at December 31, 1998.  These implied forward rates should not be
viewed as predictions of actual future interest  rates.  Restricted cash and the
Dockyard  Loans earn  interest at LIBOR (GBP) plus 0.75%.  Instruments  that are
denominated  in currencies  other than the U.S.  dollar  reporting  currency are
subject to foreign exchange rate risk as well as interest rate risk.



1998 SPECIAL CHARGES
         The third quarter of 1998 financial  results include a pretax charge of
$945.1  million  ($722.0  million  after  tax)  to  provide  for  consolidation,
restructuring and merger related expenses related to the merger with Dresser and
the industry downturn.  Components of the charge include $509.4 million of asset
related  writeoffs,   writedowns  and  charges;  $204.7  million  for  personnel
reduction  costs  covering  approximately  8,100  employees;  $121.2  million of
facility  consolidation  charges; $64.0 million of merger transaction costs; and
$45.8 million of other costs. During the fourth quarter, an additional charge of
$35.0 million  ($24.0  million after tax) was taken to provide $30.0 million for
additional personnel reduction costs covering  approximately 2,750 employees and
$5.0 million for additional facility consolidations.
         Approximately  45% of the special  charge of $980.1  million either has
resulted  or will  result  in cash  outflows.  During  1998,  cash  outflows  of
approximately  $110.0  million  pertained  to special  charge  items,  primarily
severance and merger  transaction costs, while the remainder will be incurred in
1999.
         The Company  expects to incur  additional  merger  related  incremental
costs of between $120.0 million and $130.0 million  through the end of 1999 that
do not  qualify as a special  charge  under the  accounting  rules.  These costs
include the relocation of personnel, inventory and equipment as part of facility
consolidation efforts; implementing a company-wide common information technology
infrastructure; merging engineering work practices; harmonizing employee benefit
programs;  and  developing  common  policies  and  procedures  to  provide  best
practices.  Approximately  $24.0 million of such costs were incurred  during the
fourth  quarter  of 1998.  During  1999,  approximately  $70.0  million  will be
expensed  during  the  first  and  second  quarters.  See  Note 7 to the  annual
consolidated  financial statements for additional information on special charges
incurred in 1998.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
         The Company is involved as a potentially  responsible party in remedial
activities to clean up several  "Superfund"  sites under applicable  federal law
which  imposes  joint and  several  liability,  if the harm is  indivisible,  on
certain persons without regard to fault,  the legality of the original  disposal
or  ownership  of the  site.  Although  it is very  difficult  to  quantify  the
potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management of
the Company  believes  that any liability of the Company with respect to all but
one of such  sites  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the  results of
operations  of the  Company.  See Note 10 to the annual  consolidated  financial
statements for additional information on the one site.

YEAR 2000 ISSUE
         The Year  2000  (Y2K)  issue is the risk  that  systems,  products  and
equipment  utilizing  date-sensitive  software or computer  chips with two-digit
date fields will fail to properly  recognize the Year 2000. Such failures by the
Company's  software  and  hardware  or  that  of  government  entities,  service
providers,  suppliers  and  customers  could  result  in  interruptions  of  the
Company's business which could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
         In  response  to  the  Y2K  issue,   the  Company  has  implemented  an
enterprise-wide  Year 2000  Program  designed  to  identify,  assess and address
significant  Y2K issues in the  Company's  key  business  operations,  including
products  and  services,   suppliers,  business  and  engineering  applications,
information  technology  systems,  facilities,  infrastructure and joint venture
projects.
         The Year  2000  Program  is a  comprehensive,  integrated,  multi-phase
process  covering  information  technology  systems  and  hardware  as  well  as
equipment  and products  with embedded  computer  chip  technology.  The primary
phases of the program are: (1) inventorying  existing equipment and systems; (2)
assessing equipment and systems to identify those which are not Y2K ready and to
prioritize critical items; (3) remediating, repairing or replacing non-Y2K ready
equipment and systems;  (4) testing to verify Y2K  readiness has been  achieved;
and (5) deploying and certifying.
         At the end of 1998, the Company  completed its inventory and assessment
of all mission critical items.  The Company  estimates that it will complete the
majority of its remediation phase by the end of the third quarter of 1999.



         In the  fourth  quarter  of  1998,  Landmark  Graphics  Corporation,  a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, released its Year 2000 tested version of
its integrated solutions software product.
         Overall the Company  estimates  that it is  approximately  50% complete
with  its  Year  2000   Program  and   anticipates   having  its   products  and
mission-critical  systems and  equipment  Y2K ready during the third  quarter of
1999. The balance of 1999 will be focused on deployment,  certification, testing
and implementation of new and modified programs as required.
         The Y2K issue is a  pervasive  problem  for most  companies  due to the
interdependence  of computer  systems.  Therefore,  the  Company is  continually
assessing  the risks  surrounding  this  issue and its  potential  impact on the
Company.  This  includes  the initial  phases of business  continuity  planning,
audits by customers  and meetings  with its material  customers  and  suppliers.
Meetings and  presentations  with key suppliers to date have not  identified any
key suppliers who expect significant Y2K interruption of services or supplies to
the Company.  Failure to address Y2K issues could result in business  disruption
that could materially affect the Company's operations.  In an effort to minimize
business  interruptions,  the Company is currently in the process of  developing
contingency  plans in the event  circumstances  prevent the Company from meeting
any  portion of  its current  program  schedule.  These  contingency  plans  are
expected to be completed by April 1999.
         Through 1998, the Company has incurred  approximately  $22.0 million in
costs  related to its Year 2000  Program.  The Company  estimates  that prior to
January 1, 2000 it will have spent  approximately  $50.0  million to address the
Y2K issue.  These estimates do not include the costs associated with the Company
initiatives  discussed  below.  Costs  associated with the Year 2000 Program are
being treated as period costs and expensed as incurred.
         Independent  of, but  concurrent  with,  the Company's Y2K review,  the
Company is installing an  enterprise-wide  business  information system which is
scheduled  to replace some of the  Company's  key  finance,  administrative  and
marketing software systems by the end of 1999 and is Y2K ready. In addition, and
as a  separate  activity,  the  Company  is in  the  process  of  replacing  and
standardizing  its desktop  computing  equipment  and  software and updating its
communications  infrastructure.  A third  party is updating  the  communications
infrastructure. The replacement of desktop equipment and software is an internal
program based on the Company's  common office  environment  initiative  that has
been expanded to include  Dresser.  Both of these  programs will be completed by
the end of 1999. All hardware and software installed as a part of these programs
are Y2K ready.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
         In March 1998, the American  Institute of Certified Public  Accountants
issued  Statement of Position No.  98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" (SOP 98-1).  SOP 98-1 provides
guidelines  for companies to capitalize or expense costs  incurred to develop or
obtain internal use software. The guidelines set forth in SOP 98-1 do not differ
significantly  from the  Company's  current  accounting  policy for internal use
software  and  therefore  the Company  does not expect a material  impact on its
results of operations or financial  position from the adoption of SOP 98-1.  The
Company adopted SOP 98-1 effective January 1, 1999.
         In April 1998, the American  Institute of Certified Public  Accountants
issued  Statement  of  Position  98-5,  "Reporting  on  the  Costs  of  Start-Up
Activities"  (SOP 98-5).  SOP 98-5  requires  costs of start-up  activities  and
organization  costs to be expensed  as  incurred.  The Company  adopted SOP 98-5
effective  January 1, 1999 and expects to record  expense of  approximately  $30
million  pretax or $0.04  after-tax  per diluted  share from the adoption of SOP
98-5 as the cumulative effect of an accounting change.  Estimated annual expense
for 1998 under SOP 98-5 would not have been materially different from the amount
expensed under the current accounting treatment.
         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and for Hedging  Activities"  (SFAS 133).  This  standard  requires
entities to recognize all derivatives on the statement of financial  position as
assets or liabilities and to measure the  instruments at fair value.  Accounting
for gains and losses  from  changes in those fair  values are  specified  in the
standard  depending on the intended use of the  derivative  and other  criteria.
SFAS 133 is effective for the Company  beginning January 1, 2000. The Company is
currently evaluating SFAS 133 to identify  implementation and compliance methods
and has not yet determined  the effect,  if any, on its results of operations or
financial position.



FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
         As  provided by the safe harbor  provisions  of the Private  Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995,  Halliburton Company cautions that the statements
in this annual report and elsewhere, which are forward-looking and which provide
other than  historical  information,  involve risks and  uncertainties  that may
impact   Halliburton   Company's  actual  results  of  operations.   While  such
forward-looking  information reflects Halliburton Company's best judgement based
on current  information,  it  involves a number of risks and  uncertainties  and
there can be no  assurance  that other  factors  will not affect the accuracy of
such  forward-looking  information.  While it is not  possible to  identify  all
factors, Halliburton Company continues to face many risks and uncertainties that
could  cause  actual  results to differ  from those  forward-looking  statements
including:

         -  litigation,   including,  for  example,  asbestosis  litigation  and
            environmental litigation;

            support of the type provided by Halliburton Company;
         -  operations in  countries with significant amounts of political risk,
            including, without limitation, Algeria and Nigeria;
         -  the effects of  severe weather  conditions on  operations, including
            for  example,  hurricanes   shutting  down  operations  on  offshore
            platforms;
         -  the  impact of  prolonged mild  weather conditions on the demand for
            and price of oil and natural gas;
         -  technological  and structural  changes in  the industries  served by
            Halliburton  Company;

            providers, vendors, customers  and Halliburton Company which  may be
            impacted by the Y2K issue;
         -  integration  of  acquired  businesses,  including  Dresser  and  its
            subsidiaries, into Halliburton Company;
         -  the risk  inherent in the  use of derivative instruments of the sort
            used by Halliburton Company  which could  cause a change in value of
            the  derivative  instruments  as  a  result of adverse  movements in
            foreign exchange rates;
         -  changes in the price of oil and natural gas;
         -  changes in the price of commodity chemicals used by Halliburton
            Company;
         -  changes  in  capital  spending  by   customers  in  the  hydrocarbon
            industry  for  exploration,   development,  production,  processing,
            refining and pipeline delivery networks;
         -  increased  competition in  the hiring  and retention of employees in
            certain  areas coupled  with ongoing  reductions-in-force  in  other
            areas;
         -  changes in capital spending by customers in the wood pulp and paper
            industries for plants and equipment;
         -  risks  that  result   from  entering  into  fixed  fee  engineering,
            procurement  and  construction  projects of  the  types  provided by
            Halliburton   Company   where  failure   to  meet  schedules,   cost
            estimates or  performance  targets could  result in non-reimbursable
            costs which cause the project  not to meet expected  profit margins;
            and
         -  changes  in  capital  spending  by  governments  for  infrastructure
            projects of the sort provided by Halliburton Company.

         In  addition,   future  trends  for  pricing,   margins,  revenues  and
profitability   remain  difficult  to  predict  in  the  industries   served  by
Halliburton Company.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Halliburton Company:


         We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
Halliburton  Company (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiary  companies as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related  consolidated  statements of income,
cash flows and  shareholders'  equity for each of the three  years in the period
ended  December 31, 1998.  We did not audit the  consolidated  balance  sheet of
Dresser  Industries,  Inc.,  a company  acquired  during  1998 in a  transaction
accounted  for as a pooling of  interests,  as of  December  31,  1997,  and the
related  consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1997, as discussed in
Note 14. Such statements are included in the consolidated  financial  statements
of  Halliburton  Company  and  reflect  total  assets of 48% for the year  ended
December 31, 1997, and total revenue of 46% and 47% for the years ended December
31, 1997 and 1996,  respectively,  of the  related  consolidated  totals.  These
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
and  our  opinion,  insofar  as it  relates  to  amounts  included  for  Dresser
Industries,  Inc. is based solely upon the report of the other  auditors.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of Halliburton Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits.
         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining on a test basis,  evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
         In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors,
the consolidated  financial  statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects,  the financial position of Halliburton Company and subsidiary
companies as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years ended  December  31,  1998,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING


         Halliburton Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of
its published financial statements.  The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and,  as  such,  include  amounts  based  on  judgments  and  estimates  made by
management.  The Company  also  prepared the other  information  included in the
annual  report and is  responsible  for its  accuracy and  consistency  with the
financial statements.
         The  financial   statements   have  been  audited  by  the  independent
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted access to all
financial  records  and  related  data,  including  minutes of all  meetings  of
stockholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board.
         The  Company  maintains  a system of internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  which is intended to provide  reasonable  assurance to the Company's
management  and  Board of  Directors  regarding  the  preparation  of  financial
statements.  The  system  includes a  documented  organizational  structure  and
division of  responsibility,  established  policies and procedures,  including a
code of  conduct  to  foster  a strong  ethical  climate  which is  communicated
throughout the Company,  and the careful selection,  training and development of
our people.  Internal  auditors  monitor the  operation of the internal  control
system and report  findings and  recommendations  to management and the Board of
Directors.  Corrective  actions are taken to address  control  deficiencies  and
other opportunities for improving the system as they are identified.  The Board,
operating  through its Audit Committee,  which is composed entirely of Directors
who are not current or former  officers or employees  of the  Company,  provides
oversight to the financial reporting process.
         There are inherent  limitations in the  effectiveness  of any system of
internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or  overriding  of controls.  Accordingly,  even an effective  internal  control
system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.  Furthermore,  the  effectiveness of an internal control system may
change over time.
         The  Company  assessed  its  internal  control  system in  relation  to
criteria for effective  internal control over financial  reporting  described in
"Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework"  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  upon that  assessment,  the
Company  believes that, as of December 31, 1998, its system of internal  control
over financial reporting met those criteria.

                               HALLIBURTON COMPANY
                      Notes to Annual Financial Statements

Note  1. Significant Accounting Policies
         The Company  employs  accounting  policies that are in accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States. The preparation
of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  Company  management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.
         Basis of presentation. On September 29, 1998, the Company completed the
acquisition of Dresser Industries,  Inc. (Dresser) pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger  (the  Merger)  dated as of  February  25,  1998.  The Merger was
accounted for using the pooling of interests  method of accounting  for business
combinations. Accordingly, the Company's financial statements have been restated
to include  the  accounts of Dresser  for all  periods  presented.  Prior to the
Merger,  Dresser  had a  fiscal  year-end  of  October  31.  Beginning  in 1998,
Dresser's  fiscal  year-end of October 31 has been  conformed  to  Halliburton's
calendar   year-end.   Periods  through  December  31,  1997  contain  Dresser's
information on a fiscal year-end basis combined with  Halliburton's  information
on a calendar  year-end  basis.  Dresser's  operating  results for  November and
December  of  1997  are  presented   within  the   consolidated   statements  of
shareholders' equity as "conforming fiscal years."
         Principles of  Consolidation.  The  consolidated  financial  statements
include the  accounts of the Company and all  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  All
material intercompany  accounts and transactions are eliminated.  Investments in
other  affiliated  companies in which the Company has at least 20% ownership and
does not have management control are accounted for on the equity method. Certain
prior year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to conform  with the current  year
presentation.
         Revenues and Income  Recognition.  The Company  recognizes  revenues as
services are rendered or products are shipped.  The distinction between services
and product sales is based upon the overall activity of the particular  business
operation.  Revenues from engineering and construction contracts are reported on
the percentage of completion method of accounting using measurements of progress
towards completion appropriate for the work performed.  All known or anticipated
losses on contracts are provided for currently.  Post-contract  customer support
agreements are recorded as deferred  revenues and recognized as revenue  ratably
over the  contract  periods of  generally  one  year's  duration.  Training  and
consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed.
         Research and Development. Research and development expenses are charged
to income as incurred.  Such charges were $308.1 million in 1998, $259.2 million
in 1997 and $218.0 million in 1996.
         Software  Development Costs. Costs of developing  software for sale are
charged  to  expense  when  incurred,   as  research  and   development,   until
technological  feasibility  has been  established  for the product.  Thereafter,
software  development  costs are  capitalized  until the  software  is ready for
general release to customers.  The Company capitalized costs of $13.4 million in
1998,  $14.5  million  in 1997 and $12.9  million in 1996  related  to  software
developed  for  resale.  Amortization  expense  related to these costs was $17.5
million for 1998,  $15.0 million for 1997 and $12.5  million for 1996.  Once the
software is ready for release,  amortization of the software  development  costs
begins.  Capitalized software development costs are amortized over periods which
do not exceed three years.
         Income  Per Share.  Basic  income  per share  amounts  are based on the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding  during the year.  Diluted
income  per  share  includes  additional  common  shares  that  would  have been
outstanding if potential  common shares with a dilutive  effect had been issued.
See Note 11 for a  reconciliation  of basic and  diluted  income  per share from
continuing operations. Prior year amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one
common stock split declared on June 9, 1997, and effected in the form of a stock
dividend paid on July 21, 1997.



         Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
         Receivables.    The   Company's    receivables    are   generally   not
collateralized. Notes and accounts receivable at December 31, 1998 include $33.2
million  ($30.8  million at December 31, 1997) due from  customers in accordance
with applicable retainage provisions of engineering and construction  contracts,
which  will  become  billable  upon  future  deliveries  or  completion  of such
contracts.  This amount is expected to be collected  during 1999.  Additionally,
other noncurrent assets include $7.1 million ($7.3 million at December 31, 1997)
of such retainage which is expected to be collected in years subsequent to 1999.
Unbilled work on  uncompleted  contracts  generally  represents  work  currently
billable and such work is usually billed during normal billing  processes in the
next month.  At December 31, 1998,  notes of $295.9  million  ($34.4  million at
December  31,  1997)  with  varying  interest  rates are  included  in notes and
accounts receivable. See Note 5 for information on the note receivable generated
by the sale of M-I L.L.C. (M-I).
         Inventories.  Inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost or  market.
Cost represents  invoice or production cost for new items and original cost less
allowance for condition for used  material  returned to stock.  Production  cost
includes  material,   labor  and  manufacturing   overhead.  The  cost  of  most
inventories is determined using either the first-in,  first-out (FIFO) method or
the average cost method although the cost of U.S.  manufacturing  and U.S. field
service  inventories is determined  using the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method.
Inventories  of sales items owned by foreign  subsidiaries  and  inventories  of
operating supplies and parts are generally valued at average cost.
         Property,  Plant  and  Equipment.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  is
reported at cost less accumulated  depreciation,  which is generally provided on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Certain
assets are depreciated on accelerated methods.  Accelerated depreciation methods
are also used for tax purposes, wherever permitted. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs  are  expensed;  expenditures  for  renewals  and  improvements  are
generally  capitalized.  Upon sale or retirement of an asset,  the related costs
and accumulated  depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is recognized.  When events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets may
be  impaired,   an  evaluation  is  performed  comparing  the  estimated  future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount
to determine if a write-down  to market value or  discounted  cash flow value is
required.  The Company  follows the successful  efforts method of accounting for
oil and gas properties.  At December 31, 1998, there were no significant oil and
gas  properties  in  the  production  stage  of  development.   The  Company  is
implementing an  enterprise-wide  information  system.  External direct costs of
materials and services and payroll-related  costs of employees working solely on
development  of the  software  system  portion of the project  are  capitalized.
Capitalized  costs of the project will be amortized over periods of three to ten
years  beginning when the system is placed in service.  Training costs and costs
to reengineer business processes are expensed as incurred.
         Excess of Cost Over Net  Assets  Acquired.  The excess of cost over net
assets acquired is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding
40 years.  Excess of cost  over net  assets  acquired  that is  identified  with
impaired assets, if any, will be evaluated using undiscounted  future cash flows
as the basis for determining if impairment  exists.  To the extent impairment is
indicated to exist, an impairment loss will be recognized based on fair value.
         Income Taxes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not these items will either  expire before the Company
is able to realize their  benefit,  or that future  deductibility  is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences  of events that have been realized in the  financial  statements or
tax returns.
         Derivative  Instruments.  The Company  primarily enters into derivative
financial  transactions  to hedge  existing or  projected  exposures to changing
foreign  exchange  rates and from time to time enters into  derivatives to hedge
exposures to interest rates or commodity prices. The Company does not enter into
derivative   transactions  for  speculative  or  trading  purposes.   Derivative
financial instruments to hedge exposure with an indeterminable maturity date are
generally carried at fair value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in
the results of operations. Gains or losses on hedges of identifiable commitments
are deferred and recognized  when the offsetting  gains or losses on the related
hedged  items are  recognized.  Deferred  gains or losses for  hedges  which are
terminated prior to the transaction date are recognized currently.  In the event



an identifiable  commitment is no longer  expected to be realized,  any deferred
gains or  losses  on  hedges  associated  with  the  commitment  are  recognized
currently.  Costs  associated with entering into such contracts are presented in
other assets,  while deferred gains or losses are included in other  liabilities
or other assets,  respectively,  on the consolidated balance sheets.  Recognized
gains or losses on derivatives  entered into to manage foreign exchange risk are
included in foreign currency gains and losses on the consolidated  statements of
income,  while  gains or losses  on  interest  rate  derivatives  and  commodity
derivatives are included in interest expense and operating income, respectively.
During the years ended  December  31, 1998,  1997 and 1996,  the Company did not
enter into any  significant  transactions  to hedge  interest rates or commodity
prices.
         Foreign  Currency   Translation.   Foreign  entities  whose  functional
currency  is the U.S.  dollar  translate  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  at
year-end  exchange  rates and  non-monetary  items are  translated at historical
rates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect
during the year,  except for  depreciation  and cost of product  sales which are
translated at historical  rates.  Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates
are  recognized  in  consolidated  income  in the  year of  occurrence.  Foreign
entities whose functional currency is the local currency translate net assets at
year-end  rates and income and  expense  accounts  at  average  exchange  rates.
Adjustments  resulting from these translations are reflected in the consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity titled "cumulative translation adjustment."

Note 2.  Business Segment Information
         The Company has three business  segments.  These segments are organized
around the products  and  services  provided to the  customers  they serve.  The
business units within each segment are evaluated on operating income,  operating
margins and cash value added.
         The Energy Services Group segment provides  pressure pumping  equipment
and services, logging and perforating,  drilling systems and services,  drilling
fluids systems,  drill bits, specialized completion and production equipment and
services  and well  control.  Also  included  in the Energy  Services  Group are
upstream  oil  and  gas  engineering,  construction  and  maintenance  services,
specialty pipe coating, insulation,  underwater engineering services, integrated
exploration and production  information systems and professional services to the
petroleum  industry.   The  Energy  Services  Group  has  four  business  units:
Halliburton  Energy Services,  Brown & Root Energy Services,  Landmark Graphics,
and  Halliburton  Energy  Development.   (In  March  1999,   Halliburton  Energy
Development  became  a part of  Halliburton  Energy  Services.)  The  long  term
performance  for these  business  units is linked  to the long term  demand  for
hydrocarbons.  The products and services the group provides are designed to help
discover,  develop and produce hydrocarbons.  The customers for this segment are
major  oil  companies,  national  oil  companies  and  independent  oil  and gas
companies.
         The Engineering and Construction  Group segment  provides  engineering,
procurement,  construction,  project  management,  and facilities  operation and
maintenance for  hydrocarbon  processing and other  industrial and  governmental
customers.  The  Engineering  and  Construction  Group has two  business  units:
Kellogg-Brown & Root and Brown & Root Services.  Both business units are engaged
in the delivery of engineering and construction services.
         The Dresser  Equipment Group segment designs,  manufactures and markets
highly engineered products and systems for oil and gas producers,  transporters,
processors,  distributors  and petroleum  users  throughout  the world.  Dresser
Equipment Group operates as one business unit.
         The Company's equity in pretax income or losses of related companies is
included  in  revenues  and  operating   income  of  the   applicable   segment.
Intersegment  revenues  included in the revenues of the other business  segments
and sales between geographic areas are immaterial.  General corporate assets not
included in a business segment are primarily comprised of receivables,  deferred
tax assets,  and certain  other  investments  including  the  investment  in the
Company's enterprise-wide information system.
         The tables  below  represent  the  Company's  adoption of  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information."




Operations by Business Segment





Operations by Geographic Area


Note 3.  Inventories
         Inventories  at  December  31,  1998  and  1997  are  comprised  of the
following:



     Inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method were $167.9 million and
$195.9 million at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, respectively.  If the
average cost or FIFO methods had been in use for  inventories on the LIFO basis,
total inventories would have been about $110.6 million and $100.8 million higher
than reported at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Note 4.  Property, Plant and Equipment
         Property,  plant  and  equipment  at  December  31,  1998  and  1997 is
comprised of the following:



         At December 31, 1998 and 1997, machinery,  equipment and other property
includes oil and gas  investments  of  approximately  $223.7  million and $101.7
million,  respectively and software developed for the Company's  enterprise wide
information system of $132.7 million and $59.5 million, respectively.

Note 5.  Related Companies
         The Company  conducts  some of its  operations  through  various  joint
ventures which are in partnership, corporate and other business forms, which are
principally accounted for using the equity method.



         The larger unconsolidated entities include European Marine Contractors,
Limited (EMC),  Bredero-Shaw and Ingersoll-Dresser  Pump (IDP). EMC which is 50%
owned by a  subsidiary  of the  Company and part of the Energy  Services  Group,
specializes in engineering,  procurement and  construction of marine  pipelines.
Bredero-Shaw,  which is 50% owned by a subsidiary of the Company and part of the
Energy Services Group, specializes in pipe coating. Effective February 29, 1996,
a subsidiary  of the Company  entered into an agreement to form a joint  venture
with Shaw Industries  Ltd.  (Shaw) by contributing  its Bredero Price assets and
Shaw contributing its Shaw Pipe Protection  assets on a worldwide basis.  During
the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company and Shaw agreed to a long-term extension
of their strategic pipe coating alliance,  Bredero-Shaw.  In connection with the
new agreement, Shaw agreed to pay a subsidiary of the Company $50 million over a
four-year period.  This transaction  resulted in a fourth quarter pretax gain of
$41.7 million which is reported in the consolidated  statements of income in the
caption "special  charges and credits." For balance sheet purposes,  at year-end
1997 the subsidiary of the Company deconsolidated Bredero-Shaw and accounted for
its 50% interest in the joint venture as an equity investment. The subsidiary of
the Company  includes its share of equity  earnings in the results of operations
beginning  January 1, 1998 under the equity method.  IDP which is 49% owned by a
subsidiary of the Company and part of the Dresser Equipment Group,  manufactures
a broad range of pump products and services.
         In the second quarter of 1996, M-I, formerly a 36% owned joint venture,
purchased Anchor Drilling Fluids.  The Company's share of the purchase price was
$41.3 million and is included in cash flows from other investing activities. The
Company  sold its 36%  ownership  interest in M-I to Smith  International,  Inc.
(Smith) on August 31, 1998. This transaction completed Halliburton's  commitment
to the U.S.  Department of Justice to sell its M-I interest in  connection  with
its merger with Dresser. The purchase price of $265 million was paid by Smith in
the  form of a  non-interest  bearing  promissory  note  due  April  1999.  This
receivable is included in "notes and accounts  receivable"  on the  consolidated
balance sheets. All of M-I's debt remains an obligation of M-I.
         Summarized   financial   statements  for  all  combined   jointly-owned
operations which are not consolidated are as follows:








Note 6.  Income Taxes
         The components of the (provision) benefit for income taxes are:



         Included  in federal  income  taxes are  foreign  tax credits of $182.2
million in 1998,  $154.0  million in 1997 and $109.2 million in 1996. The United
States and foreign  components of income (loss) before income taxes and minority
interests are as follows:







         The  primary  components  of the  Company's  deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:



         The Company has  provided  for the  potential  repatriation  of certain
undistributed  earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and considers earnings above
the amounts on which tax has been provided to be permanently  reinvested.  While
these additional earnings could become subject to additional tax if repatriated,
such a repatriation  is not  anticipated.  Any  additional  amount of tax is not
practicable to estimate.
         The  Company  has net  operating  loss  carryforwards  which  expire as
follows:  1999 through 2003,  $49.3 million;  2004 through 2008,  $18.8 million;
2009  through  2010,  $1.9  million.  The Company  also has net  operating  loss
carryforwards of $43.6 million with indefinite expiration dates. Reconciliations
between the actual  provision for income taxes and that computed by applying the
U.S. statutory rate to income from continuing operations before income taxes and
minority interest are as follows:







         The Company has received  statutory  notices of deficiency for the 1990
and 1991 tax years from the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) of $92.9 million and
$16.8 million,  respectively,  excluding any penalties or interest.  The Company
believes it has  meritorious  defenses  and does not expect  that any  liability
resulting  from the 1990 or 1991 tax years  will  result in a  material  adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position.  In 1996, the Company
reached  settlements with the IRS for certain matters including the 1989 taxable
year.  As a result of the  settlement  for the 1989  taxable  year,  the Company
recognized tax benefits and net income was increased by $16.1 million in 1996.

Note 7.  Special Charges and Credits
         The Company has incurred various non-recurring  transactions  resulting
from  acquisitions,  profit  initiatives,  and industry  downturns as summarized
below:
         Asset Related  Charges.  Asset related charges include  impairments and
write-offs  of  intangible   assets  and  excess  and/or  duplicate   machinery,
equipment,  inventory and capitalized software.  Charges also include write-offs
and  lease  cancellation  costs  related  to  acquired  information   technology
equipment  replaced with the Company's standard common office equipment and exit
costs on other leased assets.
         Personnel  Charges.  Personnel  charges  include  severance and related
costs  incurred to action  announced  employee  reductions  and personnel  costs
related to change of control.
         Facility Consolidation Charges.  Facility consolidation charges include
costs to dispose of owned properties or exit leased facilities.
         Merger Transaction Charges. Merger transaction costs include investment
banking,  filing fees,  legal and  professional  fees and other  merger  related
costs.
         Other Charges.  Other charges include eliminating duplicate agents,
contract cancellation costs and eliminating other duplicate capabilities.






         The third quarter of 1998 financial  results include a pretax charge of
$945.1 million ($722.0  million after tax) to provide for costs  associated with
the Merger and industry downturn due to declining oil and gas prices. During the
fourth quarter,  an additional charge of $35.0 million ($24.0 million after tax)
was taken to provide  $30.0 million for  additional  personnel  reduction  costs
covering approximately 2,750 employees within the Energy Services Group and $5.0
million for additional facility consolidations within the Energy Services Group.
         As a  result  of  the  Merger,  Halliburton  and  Dresser's  completion
products operations and its formation evaluation  businesses have been combined,
excluding  Halliburton's  logging-while-drilling (LWD) business and a portion of
its measurement-while-drilling business which were required to be disposed of in
connection with a Department of Justice  consent  decree.  See Note 14. Based on
the change in strategic direction, the outlook for the industry, the decision to
standardize equipment product offerings and the expected loss on the disposition
of the LWD business,  the Company  recorded  impairments  based upon anticipated
future cash flows in accordance  with FAS 121. This resulted in  write-downs  of
excess of cost over net assets acquired of $254.2 million related to directional
drilling  and  formation   evaluation   assets   acquired  in  1993  from  Smith
International Inc., formation evaluation assets acquired in the 1988 acquisition
of  Gearhart  Industries,  Inc.,  and  completion  products  assets  acquired in
conjunction  with the  acquisitions  of Mono  Pumps  and AVA in 1990  and  1992,
respectively.  In addition,  $162.5 million of excess and duplicated  machinery,
equipment and inventory related to formation  evaluation and completion products
have been written down.
         Additional  asset  related  charges  within the Energy  Services  Group
include excess and redundant equipment,  software,  inventory and excess of cost
over net assets  acquired of $36.0 million  related to other product lines which
are  combinations  of Halliburton  and Dresser  operations.  The remaining asset
related  charges  include $26.0 million of  write-downs of redundant or impaired
equipment,  software  and  inventory in the  Engineering  and  Construction  and
Dresser  Equipment  Groups,  plus $30.7 million for  write-downs  of information
technology equipment to be replaced with standard equipment and other duplicated
shared  services  assets  applicable to all segments.  The majority of the asset
related balance of $67.1 million at December 31, 1998 represents the write-downs
to fair value less disposal costs at the expected disposal date. The majority of
the  balance  will be utilized  during the first and second  quarters of 1999 in
connection with planned activities.
         Personnel  charges in 1998 reflect  announced  headcount  reductions of
10,850 affecting all segments, corporate and shared service functions. In total,
approximately 75% of the reductions will occur within the Energy Services Group.
During  1998,  the  Company  reduced  employment  levels,  primarily  operations
personnel by approximately 5,000  (approximately  3,000 within North America and
1,100 within Latin  America),  including 4,700 within the Energy Services Group.
The remainder  will be incurred over the balance of 1999,  primarily  during the
first and second quarter of the year.



         As a result of the Merger and the industry downturn,  the Company plans
to vacate,  sell or close over 400  service,  manufacturing  and  administrative
facilities  throughout the world. Until the properties  included in the facility
consolidation  charges are  vacated,  the Company  plans to continue  its normal
depreciation,  lease costs and operating  expenses which will be charged against
the Company's results of operations. The majority of these facilities are within
the Energy Services  Group.  During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company sold
or returned 33 service and administrative  facilities.  As of December 31, 1998,
the Company had an additional 100 vacated  properties which it is in the process
of selling, subleasing or returning to the owner.
         Halliburton  and  Dresser  merger  transaction  costs amounted to $64.0
million.  At  December  31, 1998,  $4.5 million  in estimated merger transaction
costs remain to be paid.
         Other  charges of $45.8  million  include the  estimated  contract exit
costs  associated  with the  elimination  of duplicate  agents and  suppliers in
various  countries  throughout the world.  These costs will occur during 1999 in
connection with the Company's renegotiation of these contractual agreements.
         At December  31, 1998,  no  adjustments  or reversals to the  remaining
accrued  special  charges are planned.
         In the third  quarter of 1997, a subsidiary of the Company sold certain
assets of its SubSea  operations to Global  Industries,  Inc. for $102.0 million
cash. The Company  recognized a loss of $9.7 million ($6.3 million after tax) on
the  sale.  Also in the third  quarter  of 1997,  the  Company  recorded  merger
transaction  charges of $8.6  million  (also $8.6  million  after tax) for costs
incurred by the Company and NUMAR to complete the NUMAR acquisition.
         In  the  fourth   quarter  of  1997,  the  Company   recorded   several
nonrecurring  transactions.  The  Company  recognized  a pretax  charge of $21.6
million  ($14.0  million  after tax) to provide $9.6  million  within the Energy
Services Group and $6.4 million within the Dresser  Equipment  Group for various
asset related  charges whose  carrying  value has been impaired and $5.6 million
for early  retirement  incentives.  A subsidiary of the Company,  along with its
joint venture partner  Ingersoll-Rand  Company,  approved profit  initiatives at
Dresser-Rand Company and Ingersoll-Dresser  Pump Company. The Company's share of
these initiatives included facility consolidation charges of $18.0 million ($7.5
million  after tax and  minority  interest)  for the  closure of a  Dresser-Rand
facility  in Europe,  consolidation  of repair and  service  operations  and the
discontinuance  of certain  product  lines. A subsidiary of the Company and Shaw
Industries, Ltd. agreed to a long-term extension of their strategic pipe coating
alliance.  See Note 5.  This  transaction  resulted  in a  pretax  gain of $41.7
million.
         Additionally,  the Company  recorded its share of  personnel  reduction
charges of $30.2 million recorded during the two-month period ended December 31,
1997 to reduce  employment  levels by  approximately  1,000 at Dresser-Rand  and
Ingersoll-Dresser  Pump.  These  costs have been  recorded  in the  consolidated
statements  of  shareholders'  equity as part of  conforming  the fiscal year of
Dresser to Halliburton's calendar year. See Note 1.
         During  the first  quarter of 1996,  Landmark  recorded  asset  related
charges  of  $12.2  million  ($8.7  million  after  tax)  for the  write-off  of
in-process  research and development  activities acquired in connection with the
purchase by Landmark of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities
of Western  Atlas  International,  Inc. and the  write-off of related  redundant
assets and activities.
         During the third quarter of 1996, the Company  recorded special charges
of $73.6 million  ($50.3  million after tax),  which  included  $41.0 million of
personnel  charges  to  terminate   approximately  1,000  employees  related  to
reorganization  efforts within the Engineering and Construction  Group and plans
to combine various  administrative support functions throughout the Company into
shared  services;  $20.2 million of facility charges for  restructuring  certain
Engineering and Construction  Group  businesses,  provide for excess lease space
and other items;  and $12.4  million for merger  transaction  costs  incurred in
relation to the merger with Landmark.
         The  special  charges to net  income in the third  quarter of 1996 were
offset by tax  credits  during  the same  quarter  of $43.7  million  due to the
recognition of net operating loss  carryforwards  and the settlement  during the
quarter of various issues with the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS).  The Company
reached  agreement with the IRS and recognized net operating loss  carryforwards
of $62.5 million ($22.5 million in tax benefits) from the 1989 tax year. The net
operating  loss  carryforwards  were utilized in the 1996 tax year. In addition,
the  Company  also  reached   agreement  with  the  IRS  on  issues  related  to
intercompany  pricing of goods and  services for the tax years 1989 through 1992
and entered into an advanced  pricing  agreement  for the tax years 1993 through
1998. As a result of these  agreements with the IRS, the Company  recognized tax



benefits of $16.1  million.  The Company  also  recognized  net  operating  loss
carryforwards of $14.0 million ($5.1 million in tax benefits) in certain foreign
areas due to improving profitability and restructuring of foreign operations.

 Note    8. Lines of Credit,  Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt
         Short-term  notes payable and current maturities consists of:



         At year-end 1998, the Company had committed  short-term lines of credit
totaling  $550.0 million  available and unused,  and other  short-term  lines of
credit totaling $315.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these
facilities.  The remaining  short-term debt consists primarily of $462.9 million
in commercial  paper with an effective  interest rate of 5.30% and $52.1 million
in foreign bank loans and overdraft facilities with varying rates of interest.
         Long-term debt at the end of 1998 and 1997 consists of the following:



         The Company  has issued  notes under  its medium-term  note  program as
follows:



         The Company's  8.75%  debentures  due February 2021 do not have sinking
fund  requirements  and are not redeemable  prior to maturity.  The  medium-term
notes may not be redeemed at the option of the Company prior to maturity.  There
is no sinking fund applicable to the notes. Each holder of the 6.75% medium-term
notes has the right to require  the  Company to repay such  holder's  notes,  in
whole or in part,  on February 1, 2007.  The net  proceeds  from the sale of the
notes were used for general corporate purposes.
         During March 1997, a subsidiary of the Company  incurred  $56.3 million
of term  loans in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the Royal  Dockyard  in
Plymouth,  England (the Dockyard  Loans).  The Dockyard Loans are denominated in



GBP and  bear  interest  at  LIBOR  (GBP)  plus  0.75%  payable  in  semi-annual
installments  through  March  2002.  Pursuant to certain  terms of the  Dockyard
Loans,  a  subsidiary  of the  Company  was  initially  required  to  provide  a
compensating  balance  of $28.7  million  which is  restricted  as to use by the
subsidiary.  The  compensating  balance  amount  decreases in  proportion to the
outstanding  debt  related to the  Dockyard  Loans and earns  interest at a rate
equal to that of the Dockyard  Loans.  At December 31,  1998,  the  compensating
balance of $14.9 million is included in other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets.
         Long-term  debt  matures  over the next five  years as  follows:  $58.5
million in 1999;  $308.3 million in 2000; $8.3 million in 2001; $85.3 million in
2002; and $138.8 million in 2003.

Note 9. Dresser Financial Information
         Dresser  Industries  Inc. has ceased filing  periodic  reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Dresser's 8% senior notes (the Notes) remain
outstanding  and the Notes are fully  guaranteed by the Company.  See Note 8. As
long as the  Notes  remain  outstanding,  summarized  financial  information  of
Dresser will be presented in periodic  reports filed by the Company on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q. The Company has not presented separate  financial  statements and
other  disclosures  concerning  Dresser  because  management has determined such
information is not material to holders of the Notes.
         In January 1999, as part of the legal  reorganization  associated  with
the Merger, Halliburton Delaware, Inc., a first tier holding company subsidiary,
was  merged  into  Dresser  Industries,  Inc.  As a result of this  action,  the
majority of the operating  assets and activities of the combined company in 1999
will be included within the legal structure of Dresser Industries, Inc.





Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
         Leases.  At year  end  1998,  the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  were
obligated  under  noncancelable  operating  leases,  expiring  on various  dates
through  2021,  principally  for  the use of  land,  offices,  equipment,  field
facilities,  and  warehouses.  Aggregate  rentals charged to operations for such
leases totaled $207.1 million in 1998, $202.8 million in 1997 and $177.8 million
in 1996.  Future  aggregate  rentals on  noncancelable  operating  leases are as
follows:  1999, $147.3 million; 2000, $121.0 million; 2001, $96.6 million; 2002,
$83.1 million; 2003, $60.9 million; and thereafter, $150.7 million.



         Asbestosis Litigation.  Since 1976, Dresser and its former divisions or
subsidiaries  have been involved in litigation  resulting from  allegations that
third parties had sustained  injuries and damage from the inhalation of asbestos
fibers  contained  in certain  products  manufactured  by Dresser and its former
divisions or subsidiaries or companies acquired by Dresser.
         Over the last 20 years  approximately  183,000  claims  have been filed
against Dresser and its former divisions or subsidiaries.  Claims continue to be
filed with 29,400 new claims filed in 1998.  Dresser and its former divisions or
subsidiaries  have entered into agreements with insurance  carriers which cover,
in whole or in part,  indemnity  payments,  legal fees and  expenses for certain
categories of claims.  Dresser and its former  divisions or subsidiaries  are in
negotiation with carriers over coverage for the remaining  categories of claims.
Because these  agreements are governed by exposure  dates,  payment type and the
product  involved,  the covered amount varies by individual  claim. In addition,
lawsuits are pending  against  several  carriers  seeking to recover  additional
amounts related to these claims.
         Since 1976,  Dresser and its former  divisions  and  subsidiaries  have
settled or disposed of 120,000  claims for a gross cost of  approximately  $89.1
million with insurance carriers paying all but $37.0 million. Provision has been
made for the estimated  exposure,  based on historical  experience  and expected
recoveries from insurance carriers, related to the 63,400 claims which were open
at  the  end of  1998  including  14,000  for  which  settlements  are  pending.
Management has no reason to believe that the insurance carriers will not be able
to meet their share of future obligations under the agreements.
         Pursuant  to an  agreement  entered  into at the time of the  spin-off,
Global Industrial Technologies,  Inc. ("Global" formerly INDRESCO, Inc.) assumed
liability for asbestos  related claims filed against Dresser after July 31, 1992
relating to refractory products  manufactured or marketed by the Harbison-Walker
Refractories  Division of Dresser  Industries,  Inc. These  asbestos  claims are
subject to certain  agreements  with  insurance  carriers that cover expense and
indemnity payments.  Global now disputes that it assumed  responsibility for any
of such asbestos  claims based on  negligence.  Global also now asserts  certain
other claims relating to the insurance  coverage  responding to asbestos claims.
In order to resolve these assertions,  Global has invoked the dispute resolution
provisions of the 1992 agreement, which require binding arbitration. On February
19, 1999 Dresser filed suit in the Delaware Chancery Court seeking an injunction
to  restrain  such  arbitration  as being  barred  by the  Delaware  statute  of
limitations.  The  Company  believes  that  these new  assertions  by Global are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against them.
         Management   recognizes  the   uncertainties   of  litigation  and  the
possibility that a series of adverse rulings could  materially  impact operating
results.  However,  based upon  Dresser's  historical  experience  with  similar
claims,  the time elapsed since Dresser and its former divisions or subsidiaries
discontinued   sale  of   products   containing   asbestos,   and   management's
understanding  of the facts  and  circumstances  that gave rise to such  claims,
management  believes that the pending  asbestos claims will be resolved  without
material effect on Halliburton's financial position or results of operations.
         Environmental.  The Company is involved  through its  subsidiaries as a
potential  responsible  party (PRP) in remedial  activities  to clean up various
"Superfund"  sites under applicable  federal law which imposes joint and several
liability,  if the harm is  indivisible,  on certain  persons  without regard to
fault, the legality of the original disposal, or ownership of the site. Although
it is very  difficult  to  quantify  the  potential  impact of  compliance  with
environmental  protection  laws,  management  of the Company  believes  that any
liability of the Company with respect to all but one of such sites will not have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Company.
         With  respect  to a site in  Jasper  County,  Missouri  (Jasper  County
Superfund Site), sufficient information that would enable management to quantify
the Company's potential liability has not been developed and management believes
the process of determining the nature and extent of remediation at this site and
the total costs thereof will be lengthy. Brown & Root, Inc., now Kellogg Brown &
Root,  Inc.  (KBR),  a subsidiary  of the Company,  has been named as a PRP with
respect to the Jasper  County  Superfund  Site by the  Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA). The Jasper County Superfund Site includes areas of mining activity
that occurred from the 1800s through the mid 1950s in the  southwestern  portion
of Missouri.  The site contains lead and zinc mine tailings produced from mining
activities.  KBR is one of nine participating PRPs that have agreed to perform a
Remedial  Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), which, due to various delays,
is not expected to be  completed  until late 1999.  Although  the entire  Jasper



County  Superfund  Site  comprises  237 square  miles as listed on the  National
Priorities  List, in the RI/FS scope of work, the EPA has only identified  seven
areas,  or subsites,  within this area that need to be studied and then possibly
remediated by the PRPs.  Additionally,  the Administrative  Order on Consent for
the RI/FS only requires KBR to perform RI/FS work at one of the subsites  within
the site, the Neck/Alba  subsite,  which only comprises 3.95 square miles. KBR's
share of the cost of such a study is not expected to be material. In addition to
the Superfund  issues,  the State of Missouri has  indicated  that it may pursue
natural  resource damage claims against the PRPs. At the present time KBR cannot
determine the extent of its liability,  if any, for remediation costs or natural
resource damages on any reasonably practicable basis.
         General  Litigation.  The  purchasers  of  Dresser's  former  hand tool
division sued Dresser for fraud in connection with the October 1983 transaction.
In May 1994, the jury returned a verdict awarding the plaintiffs $4.0 million in
compensatory damages and $50.0 million in punitive damages. On October 13, 1994,
the Court ordered a reduction of damages from $54.0 to $12.0 million. On October
15, 1996, the Court of Appeals  issued its decision  reversing the trial court's
decision as to  compensatory  and punitive  damages and remanding the case for a
new trial on  damages.  On remand,  the trial court  ordered  that the new trial
contemplated by the appellate decision be limited to compensatory  damages only,
despite the express  statement  that punitive  damages were also  reversed,  and
decided that the court would review the original  punitive damages verdict after
the retrial on compensatory damages.
         As of  October,  1998 the trial was held on  compensatory  damages  and
concluded  with a jury  award  of $1.  Following  that,  a  hearing  was held in
January,  at which the judge reduced the punitive  damage award from $50 million
to  $650,000.  The sum of  $650,001  was paid  during the first week of February
1999, and this case is now concluded.
         Merger.  In connection with the Merger,  Dresser and its directors have
been named as  defendants in three  lawsuits  filed in late February of 1998 and
early March of 1998 in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The lawsuits each purport
to be a class action filed on behalf of Dresser's  stockholders  and allege that
the  consideration  to be  paid  to  Dresser's  stockholders  in the  Merger  is
inadequate and does not reflect the true value of Dresser.  The complaints  also
each allege that the directors of Dresser have breached their  fiduciary  duties
in approving the Merger. One of the actions further alleges  self-dealing on the
part of the individual  defendants and asserts that the directors are obliged to
conduct an auction to assure that  stockholders  receive the maximum  realizable
value for their  shares.  All  three  actions  seek  preliminary  and  permanent
injunctive relief as well as damages. On June 10, 1998 the court issued an order
consolidating  the three  lawsuits  which  requires  the  plaintiffs  to file an
amended  consolidated  complaint "as soon as practicable."  To date,  plaintiffs
have not filed an amended complaint.  The Company believes that the lawsuits are
without merit and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.
         Other.  The Company and its  subsidiaries  are parties to various other
legal  proceedings.  Although the ultimate  dispositions of such proceedings are
not presently determinable, in the opinion of the Company any liability that may
ensue will not be material in relation to the  consolidated  financial  position
and results of operations of the Company.



Note 11.  Income Per Share


         Basic income per share amounts are based on the weighted average number
of common  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  income  per share
includes  additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential
common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Diluted earnings per share
for 1998 excludes 3.3 million  potential  common shares which were  antidilutive
for earnings per share  purposes.  Also excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share are options to purchase 1.4 million shares of common stock in
1998; 1.1 million shares in 1997; and 2.6 million shares in 1996.  These options
were outstanding  during these  respective  years, but were excluded because the
option  exercise  price was greater than the average  market price of the common
shares.

Note 12.  Common Stock
         On June 25,  1998,  the  Company's  shareholders  voted to increase the
Company's number of authorized shares from 400.0 million to 600.0 million.
         On May 20,  1997,  the  Company's  shareholders  voted to increase  the
Company's number of authorized shares from 200.0 million shares to 400.0 million
shares. On June 9, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split  effected in the form of a stock  dividend  distributed  on July 21,
1997 to  shareholders of record on June 26, 1997. The par value of the Company's
common  stock of $2.50 per share  remained  unchanged.  As a result of the stock
split,  $556.3  million was  transferred  from paid-in  capital in excess of par
value to common stock.  Historical share and per share amounts  presented on the
supplemental  consolidated  statements  of income  and in the  discussion  below
concerning  stock options and restricted stock have been restated to reflect the
stock split.
         The  Company's  1993 Stock and  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan (1993  Plan)
provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards: (1) stock
options,  including incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options; (2)
stock  appreciation  rights,  in tandem with stock options or freestanding;  (3)
restricted stock; (4) performance  share awards;  and (5) stock value equivalent
awards.  Under the terms of the 1993 Plan as amended,  27 million  shares of the
Company's  Common Stock have been  reserved for  issuance to key  employees.  At
December 31, 1998,  14.6 million  shares were  available for future grants under
the 1993 Plan.
         In  connection  with the  acquisitions  of Dresser,  Landmark  Graphics
Corporation  (Landmark) and NUMAR Corporation (NUMAR) (see Note 14), outstanding
stock options under the stock option plans  maintained by Dresser,  Landmark and
NUMAR were assumed by the Company.  Stock option  transactions  summarized below
include  amounts  for the 1993 Plan,  the Dresser  plans  using the  acquisition
exchange rate of 1 share for each Dresser  share,  the Landmark  plans using the
acquisition exchange rate of 1.148 shares for each Landmark share, and the NUMAR
plans using the acquisition  exchange rate of .9664 shares for each NUMAR share.
The period from December 1997 to December  1998  includes  Dresser's  activities
from its fiscal  year-end of October  1997 to December  1997 in order to conform
Dresser's fiscal year-end to Halliburton's calendar year-end.






         Options outstanding at December 31, 1998 are composed of the following:



         There were 6.9  million  options  exercisable  with a weighted  average
exercise  price  of  $21.17  at  December  31,  1997,  and 6.5  million  options
exercisable  with a weighted  average  exercise  price of $18.57 at December 31,
1996.
         All stock options  under the 1993 Plan,  including  options  granted to
employees  of  Dresser,  Landmark  and  NUMAR  since  the  acquisition  of  such
companies, are granted at the fair market value of the Common Stock at the grant
date.  Landmark,  prior to its acquisition by the Company, had provisions in its
plans  that  allowed  Landmark  to  set  option  exercise  prices  at a  defined
percentage below fair market value.
         The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated  using the
Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.  The  weighted  average  assumptions  and
resulting fair values of options granted are as follows:







         Stock  options  generally  expire ten years from the grant date.  Stock
options vest over a three-year  period,  with  one-third of the shares  becoming
exercisable on each of the first,  second and third  anniversaries  of the grant
date.
         The Company accounts for its option plans in accordance with Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25,  under which no  compensation  cost has been
recognized  for stock option  awards.  Had  compensation  cost for the Company's
stock option  programs been  determined  consistent  with Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation" (SFAS
123),  the Company's  pro forma net income (loss) for 1998,  1997 and 1996 would
have been $(42.6)  million,  $750.3  million and $547.1  million,  respectively,
resulting  in diluted  earnings  (loss) per share of  $(0.10),  $1.72 and $1.27,
respectively.
         Restricted  shares awarded under the 1993 Plan for 1998,  1997 and 1996
were 414,510; 515,650; and 363,800,  respectively. The shares awarded are net of
forfeitures  of  136,540;  34,900;  and  34,600  shares in 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively.  The  weighted  average fair market value per share at the date of
grant of shares  granted in 1998,  1997 and 1996 was $34.77,  $45.29 and $28.24,
respectively.
         The  Company's   Restricted  Stock  Plan  for  Non-Employee   Directors
(Restricted  Stock  Plan)  allows for each  non-employee  director to receive an
annual award of 400 restricted shares of Common Stock as a part of compensation.
The Company reserved 100,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to non-employee
directors.  The Company issued 3,200; 3,200 and 3,600 restricted shares in 1998,
1997 and 1996,  respectively,  under this plan.  At December  31,  1998,  20,400
shares have been issued to non-employee  directors under this plan. The weighted
average  fair market  value per share at the date of grant of shares  granted in
1998, 1997 and 1996 was $36.31, $46.06 and $26.57, respectively.
         The Company's  Employees'  Restricted  Stock Plan was  established  for
employees  who are not officers,  for which 200,000  shares of Common Stock have
been  reserved.  At December  31,  1998,  170,300  shares (net of 26,700  shares
forfeited) have been issued.  Forfeitures were 1,900;  14,600 and 8,400 in 1998,
1997 and 1996,  respectively,  and no  further  grants are being made under this
plan.
         Under the terms of the Company's Career Executive Incentive Stock Plan,
15 million  shares of the  Company's  Common Stock were reserved for issuance to
officers and key employees at a purchase  price not to exceed par value of $2.50
per share.  At December 31, 1998, 11.7 million shares (net of 2.2 million shares
forfeited) have been issued under the plan. No further grants will be made under
the Career Executive Incentive Stock Plan.
         Restricted  shares issued under the 1993 Plan,  Restricted  Stock Plan,
Employees'  Restricted Stock Plan and the Career Executive  Incentive Stock Plan
are  limited  as  to  sale  or  disposition  with  such   restrictions   lapsing
periodically  over an extended period of time not exceeding ten years.  The fair
market  value of the stock,  on the date of  issuance,  is being  amortized  and
charged to income  (with  similar  credits  to paid-in  capital in excess of par
value)  generally over the average period during which the  restrictions  lapse.
Compensation  costs  recognized  in  income  for  1998,  1997 and 1996 were $7.6
million, $7.1 million and $6.9 million,  respectively. At December 31, 1998, the
unamortized amount is $50.6 million.

Note 13.  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
         The Company has previously  declared a dividend of one preferred  stock
purchase  right (a  Right)  on each  outstanding  share of  Common  Stock.  This
dividend is also  applicable to each share of Halliburton  Common Stock that was
issued  subsequent  to  adoption  of the  Rights  Agreement  entered  into  with
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. (the Rights Agent). Each Right entitles
its holder to buy one  two-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series A Junior



Participating  Preferred Stock,  without par value, at an exercise price of $75.
These Rights are subject to certain  antidilution  adjustments,  which have been
set out in the Rights  Agreement  entered into with the Rights Agent. The Rights
do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to dividends.
         The  Rights  become   exercisable  in  certain  limited   circumstances
involving a potential business combination. After the Rights become exercisable,
each Right will  entitle its holder to an amount of Common Stock of the Company,
or  in  certain  circumstances,  securities  of  the  acquirer,  having  in  the
aggregate,  a market value equal to two times the  exercise  price of the Right.
The Rights are redeemable at the Company's option at any time before they become
exercisable.  The Rights  expire on December 15, 2005. No event during 1998 made
the Rights exercisable.

Note  14. Acquisitions and Dispositions
         Dresser  Merger.  On  September  29,  1998 the  Company  completed  the
acquisition  of  Dresser  Industries,  Inc.  (the  Merger),  by  converting  the
outstanding  Dresser common stock into an aggregate of approximately 176 million
shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Company.   The  Company  has  also  reserved
approximately  7.3 million shares of common stock for outstanding  Dresser stock
options and other  employee  and  directors  plans.  The Merger  qualified  as a
tax-free exchange to Dresser's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and was  accounted for using the pooling of interests  method of accounting  for
business combinations. Accordingly, the Company's financial statements have been
restated to include the results of Dresser for all periods presented.  Beginning
in 1998,  Dresser's  year-end of October 31 has been conformed to  Halliburton's
calendar year-end.  Periods through December 1997 contain Dresser's  information
on a fiscal year-end basis combined with Halliburton's information on a calendar
year-end basis. For the two months ended December 31, 1997, Dresser had revenues
of $1,110.2 million,  operating income of $53.2 million, and net income of $35.8
million.  Operating  income for the two-month  period  includes a pretax special
charge of $30.2 million ($12.0 million after tax and minority  interest) related
to Dresser's share of profit  improvement  initiatives at the  Dresser-Rand  and
Ingersoll-Dresser Pump joint ventures.
         Results  for the  two-month  period  have  been  included  in  retained
earnings,  and  dividends  of $33.2  million  paid in  December  1997  have been
deducted from retained earnings in the consolidated  statements of shareholders'
equity at December 31, 1998 as conforming  fiscal years. The change to Dresser's
cumulative  translation  adjustment  account for the period between  October 31,
1997 and December 31, 1997 of $14.8 million is also included in the consolidated
statements of  shareholders'  equity as conforming  fiscal years.  There were no
material transactions between Halliburton and Dresser prior to the Merger.
         Combined and separate  companies results of Halliburton and Dresser for
the periods preceding the merger are as follows:




         LWD Divestiture. In January 1999, in accordance with the consent decree
Halliburton  entered into with the U.S.  Department  of Justice on September 29,
1998, an agreement was reached with W-H Energy Services, Inc. (W-H) for the sale



of  Halliburton's  logging-while-drilling  (LWD) and  related measurement-while-
drilling (MWD) business known as PathFinder  and currently  a part of the Energy
Services Group.
         Completion of the sale of the  PathFinder  business was approved by the
Department of Justice on March 3, 1999.  The Company  expects to incur a loss on
the sale which is  expected to be  completed  in March  1999.  Halliburton  will
provide  separate LWD services  through its Sperry Sun business unit,  which was
acquired  as part of the merger with  Dresser  and is now a part of  Halliburton
Energy  Services.  In addition,  Halliburton  will continue to provide sonic LWD
services using its existing technologies, which it will share with PathFinder.
         M-I L.L.C. Drilling Divestiture.  In August 1998, the  Company sold its
36% interest in M-I L.L.C. (M-I) with no significant effect on net income for
the year.  M-I was previously a part of the Energy Services Group.  See Note 5.
         Acquisition  of  Devonport  Royal  Dockyard.  During  March  1997,  the
Devonport  management  consortium,  Devonport Management Limited (DML), which is
51% owned by a subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Devonport
Royal  Dockyard  plc,  which  owns and  operates  the  Government  of the United
Kingdom's Royal Dockyard in Plymouth,  England, for approximately $64.9 million.
Concurrent with the acquisition of the Royal Dockyard,  the Company's  ownership
interest in DML increased  from about 30% to 51% and DML borrowed  $56.3 million
under term  loans.  The  dockyard  principally  provides  repair  and  refitting
services for the British Royal Navy's fleet of submarines and surface ships. DML
is a part of the Engineering and Construction Group.
         Acquisition of OGC  International  and Kinhill.  During April 1997, the
Company  completed  its  acquisition  of the  outstanding  common  stock  of OGC
International  plc (OGC) for  approximately  $118.3  million.  OGC is engaged in
providing  a  variety  of  engineering,  operations  and  maintenance  services,
primarily to the North Sea oil and gas production  industry and is a part of the
Energy Services Group.
         During July 1997, the Company  acquired all of the  outstanding  common
stock and  convertible  debentures  of Kinhill  Holdings  Limited  (Kinhill) for
approximately  $34  million.  Kinhill,   headquartered  in  Australia,  provides
engineering in mining and minerals  processing,  petroleum and chemicals,  water
and wastewater, transportation and commercial and civil infrastructure.  Kinhill
markets its services  primarily in Australia,  Indonesia,  Thailand,  Singapore,
India and the Philippines. Kinhill is a part of the Engineering and Construction
Group.
         In 1997,  the Company  recorded  approximately  $99.1 million excess of
cost over net assets acquired primarily related to the purchase  acquisitions of
OGC and Kinhill.
         Acquisition of NUMAR. On September 30, 1997, the Company  completed its
acquisition  of NUMAR through the merger of a subsidiary of the Company with and
into  NUMAR,  the  conversion  of the  outstanding  NUMAR  common  stock into an
aggregate of approximately 8.2 million shares of common stock of the Company and
the  assumption by the Company of the  outstanding  NUMAR stock options (for the
exercise of which the Company has  reserved an aggregate  of  approximately  0.9
million  shares of common  stock of the  Company).  The  merger  qualified  as a
tax-free exchange and was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of
accounting for business combinations. The Company has not restated its financial
statements to include NUMAR's historical operating results because they were not
material to the Company.
         NUMAR's  assets and  liabilities on September 30, 1997 were included in
the Company's accounts of the same date,  resulting in an increase in net assets
of  $21.3  million.  Headquartered  in  Malvern,  Pennsylvania,  NUMAR  designs,
manufactures and markets the Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging Logging (MRIL(R)) tool
which utilizes magnetic resonance imaging technology to evaluate subsurface rock
formations  in newly  drilled  oil and gas wells.  NUMAR is a part of the Energy
Services Group.
         SubSea  Asset Sale.  In June 1997,  a  subsidiary  of the Company  sold
certain assets of its SubSea  operations to Global  Industries,  Ltd. for $102.0
million and  recognized a loss of $6.3  million (net of tax of $3.4  million) on
the sale. SubSea is a part of the Energy Services Group.
         Environmental Services Divestiture.  On December 31, 1997, a subsidiary
of the Company sold its environmental  services business to Tetra Tech, Inc. for
approximately  $32  million.  The sale was prompted by the  Company's  desire to
divest non-core  businesses and had no significant  effect on the net income for
the year.  The  environmental  services  business  was  previously a part of the
Engineering and Construction Group.
         Landmark   Graphics.   In  October  1996,  the  Company  completed  its
acquisition  of  Landmark  through  the  merger  of  Landmark  with  and  into a
subsidiary of the Company,  the conversion of the  outstanding  Landmark  common



stock into an aggregate of approximately  20.4 million shares of common stock of
the Company (after giving effect to the Company's  two-for-one  stock split) and
the assumption by the Company of the  outstanding  Landmark  stock options.  The
merger qualified as a tax-free  exchange and was accounted for using the pooling
of interests  method of  accounting  for business  combinations.  The  Company's
financial  statements  have been restated to include the results of Landmark for
all periods presented prior to the date of completion. Landmark is a part of the
Energy Services Group.
         Prior to its acquisition by Halliburton, Landmark had a fiscal year-end
of June 30.  Landmark's  results have been restated to conform with  Halliburton
Company's  calendar  year-end.  Combined and separate results of Halliburton and
Landmark for the periods preceding the merger are as follows:



         The Company  acquired other businesses in 1998, 1997 and 1996 for $42.0
million, $3.6 million and $32.2 million, respectively.  These businesses did not
have a significant effect on revenues or earnings.

Note 15.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management
         Foreign  Exchange Risk.  Techniques in managing  foreign  exchange risk
include,  but are not limited to, foreign  currency  borrowing and investing and
the use of  currency  derivative  instruments.  The Company  selectively  hedges
significant  exposures to potential foreign exchange losses considering  current
market  conditions,  future  operating  activities  and the cost of hedging  the
exposure in relation to the perceived risk of loss. The purpose of the Company's
foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that
the eventual  dollar cash flows resulting from the sale and purchase of products
in foreign  currencies will be adversely  affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial  instruments for trading
or speculative purposes.
         The Company  hedges its currency  exposure  through the use of currency
derivative instruments.  Such contracts generally have an expiration date of two
years  or  less.  Forward  exchange  contracts  (commitments  to buy  or  sell a
specified  amount  of a  foreign  currency  at a  specified  price and time) are
generally used to hedge  identifiable  foreign currency  commitments.  Losses of
$1.4 million for  identifiable  foreign  currency  commitments  were deferred at
December  31, 1998.  Forward  exchange  contracts  and foreign  exchange  option
contracts  (which  convey the right,  but not the  obligation,  to sell or buy a
specified amount of foreign currency at a specified price) are generally used to
hedge foreign currency commitments with an indeterminable maturity date. None of
the forward or option contracts are exchange traded.
         While hedging  instruments are subject to  fluctuations in value,  such
fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being
hedged.  The use of some  contracts may limit the  Company's  ability to benefit
from favorable  fluctuations in foreign  exchange rates. The notional amounts of
open forward  contracts  and options were $595.9  million and $697.2  million at
year-end  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  The notional  amounts of the  Company's
foreign exchange  contracts do not generally  represent amounts exchanged by the
parties,  and thus,  are not a measure of the  exposure of the Company or of the



cash  requirements  relating  to these  contracts.  The  amounts  exchanged  are
calculated  by  reference  to the  notional  amounts  and by other  terms of the
derivatives,  such as exchange rates. The Company actively  monitors its foreign
currency exposure and adjusts the amounts hedged as appropriate.
         Exposures to certain  currencies are generally not hedged due primarily
to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded currencies).
The Company  attempts to manage its working capital position to minimize foreign
currency  commitments in non-traded  currencies and recognizes  that pricing for
the  services and products  offered in such  countries  should cover the cost of
exchange rate devaluations.  The Company has historically  incurred  transaction
losses in non-traded currencies.
         Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents, investments and
trade  receivables.  It is the Company's  practice to place its cash equivalents
and investments in high quality securities with various investment institutions.
The Company  derives the  majority of its  revenues  from sales and services to,
including  engineering and  construction  for, the energy  industry.  Within the
energy industry,  trade receivables are generated from a broad and diverse group
of customers.  There are  concentrations of receivables in the United States and
the United Kingdom. The Company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the
expected collectibility of all trade accounts receivable.
         There  are no  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  with  any
individual  counterparty  or groups of  counterparties  related to the Company's
derivative  contracts.  Counterparties  are  selected  by the  Company  based on
creditworthiness,   which  the  Company   continually   monitors,   and  on  the
counterparties'  ability to  perform  their  obligations  under the terms of the
transactions.  The Company  does not expect any  counterparties  to fail to meet
their  obligations under these contracts given their high credit ratings and, as
such,  considers the credit risk associated with its derivative  contracts to be
minimal.
         Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments.  The  estimated  fair  value of
long-term  debt at year-end  1998 and 1997 was  $1,577.6  million  and  $1,380.8
million, respectively, as compared to the carrying amount of $1,428.2 million at
year-end  1998 and $1,304.3  million at year-end  1997.  The fair value of fixed
rate  long-term  debt is based on quoted  market  prices  for  those or  similar
instruments.  The carrying amount of variable rate long-term debt and restricted
cash (see Note 8)  approximates  fair value  because  such  instruments  reflect
market changes to interest rates.  The carrying  amount of short-term  financial
instruments  (cash and  equivalents,  receivables,  short-term notes payable and
accounts payable) as reflected in the consolidated  balance sheets  approximates
fair value due to the short maturities of these  instruments.  The fair value of
currency  derivative  instruments  which generally  approximates  their carrying
amount  based  upon third  party  quotes was $4.4  million  receivable  and $4.7
million payable at December 31, 1998.

Note 16.  Retirement Plans
         The  Company  and its  subsidiaries  have  various  plans which cover a
significant number of their employees.  These plans include defined contribution
plans, which provide  retirement  contributions in return for services rendered,
provide an individual  account for each  participant and have terms that specify
how contributions to the participant's  account are to be determined rather than
the amount of pension  benefits the participant is to receive.  Contributions to
these plans are based on pre-tax income and/or discretionary  amounts determined
on an annual basis.  The Company's  expense for the defined  contribution  plans
totaled $151.8  million,  $213.2  million,  and $156.0 million in 1998, 1997 and
1996.  Other  retirement  plans include defined  benefit plans,  which define an
amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of
service or  compensation.  These  plans are funded to operate on an  actuarially
sound basis. Plan assets are primarily invested in cash, short-term investments,
real estate,  equity and fixed income  securities  of entities  domiciled in the
country of the plan's operation.






         The Company  recognized an  additional  minimum  pension  liability for
underfunded  defined benefit plans. The additional minimum liability is equal to
the excess of the  accumulated  benefit  obligation over plan assets and accrued
liabilities.  A corresponding amount is recognized as either an intangible asset
or a reduction of shareholders' equity.







         Assumed  long-term  rates of  return on plan assets, discount rates for
estimating benefit obligations and rates of compensation  increases vary for the
different plans according to  the local economic conditions.  The rates used are
as follows:





         In 1996 the pension  plans had net service cost of $31.3  million;  net
interest  cost of $73.5  million;  net actual  return on plan  assets of ($109.8
million);  and net amortization and deferral of $10.0 million,  resulting in net
periodic pension cost of $5 million.
         The projected benefit obligation,  accumulated benefit obligation,  and
fair  value of plan  assets  for the  pension  plans  with  accumulated  benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets were $201 million,  $193 million,  and $123
million,  respectively,  as of December 31, 1998, and $103 million, $97 million,
and $51 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1997.
         Postretirement  Medical Plan. The Company offers postretirement medical
plans to certain eligible  employees.  In some plans the Company's  liability is
limited to a fixed  contribution  amount for each participant or dependent.  The
plan participants share the total cost for all benefits provided above the fixed
Company contribution and participants' contributions are adjusted as required to
cover benefit payments.  The Company has made no commitment to adjust the amount
of its contributions; therefore, the computed accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation  amount  is not  affected  by the  expected  future  healthcare  cost
inflation rate.
         Other  postretirement  medical plans are  contributory  but the Company
generally  absorbs  the  majority  of the costs.  In these plans the Company may
elect to  adjust  the  amount of its  contributions.  As a result  the  computed
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation amount is affected by the expected
future  healthcare  cost  inflation  rate.  These plans have assumed  healthcare
trend rates (weighted based on the current year benefit  obligation) for 1998 of
7% which are expected to decline to 5% by 2002.
         During  1997,  the Company  adopted  amendments  to  eliminate  certain
postretirement  medical  benefit  programs.   These  amendments  resulted  in  a
curtailment gain of $11.2 million.














         In 1996 the  postretirement  medical plans had net service cost of $4.7
million;  net interest cost of $30.9 million;  and net amortization and deferral
of  ($20.4 million), resulting  in net periodic  postretirement  medical cost of
$15.2 million.
         Assumed  healthcare  cost trend rates have a significant  effect on the
amounts  reported for the total of the healthcare plans. A  one-percentage-point
change in assumed healthcare  cost trend rates would have the following effects:
