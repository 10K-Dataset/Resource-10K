                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

      Omnicom  Group  Inc.,  through  its wholly and  partially-owned  companies
(hereinafter  collectively referred to as the "Company" or the "Omnicom Group"),
provides  corporate  communications  services to clients  worldwide on a global,
pan-regional,  national and local basis.  Operations  cover the major regions of

segment reporting see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




Clients

      The clients of the Omnicom Group include major  industrial,  financial and
service industry companies as well as smaller, pan-regional,  national and local
clients.

      The Omnicom Group's ten largest clients accounted for approximately 19% of
1998 commission and fees. The majority of these have been clients on average for
more than  twenty-five  years.  Twelve  Omnicom  Group  agency  brands  provided
services to the Company's  largest client,  which accounted for approximately 5%
of 1998 commissions and fees. 

Commissions and Fees

      Commissions  charged on media  billings are not uniform and are negotiated
with the  client.  In  accordance  with  industry  practice,  the  media  source
typically bills the agency for the time or space purchased and the Omnicom Group
companies bill their clients for this amount plus the commission.

      In  many  cases,  fees  are  generated  in lieu  of  commissions.  Several
different  fee  arrangements  are used  depending  on the client and  individual
agency. In general,  fee charges relate to the cost of providing services plus a
markup.

      Revenues are dependent upon the marketing requirements of clients and tend
to be highest in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year.

Competitive Conditions

      The  Company's  business  is highly  competitive  and  accounts  may shift
agencies,  usually on 90 days' notice.  Clients may also reduce  advertising and
marketing budgets at any time. An agency's ability to compete for new clients is
affected in some instances by the policy,  which many  advertisers and marketers
follow,  of not permitting their agencies to represent  competitive  accounts in
the same market.  As a result,  increasing size may limit an agency's  potential
for  securing  certain new  clients.  In the vast  majority  of cases,  however,
Omnicom Group's  consistent  maintenance of separate,  independent agency brands
have enabled the Company to represent competing clients.

      The Omnicom  agency  brands have  sought,  and will seek,  new business by
showing potential clients examples of advertising and marketing campaigns and by
explaining the variety of related services  offered.  The Omnicom Group competes
in the United  States and  internationally  with a multitude of full service and
special  service  agencies.  In  addition  to the usual  risks of the  Company's
business,  international operations are subject to the risk of currency exchange
fluctuations,  exchange  control  restrictions  and to actions  of  governmental
authorities. 

Employees

      The  business  success of the Omnicom  Group is, and will  continue to be,
highly dependent upon the skills and creativity of its creative, research, media
and account personnel and their relationships with clients. The Company believes
its agencies have established reputations for creativity and marketing expertise
which attract,  retain and stimulate  talented  personnel.  There is substantial
competition among advertising  agencies for talented  personnel and all agencies
are  vulnerable  to  adverse  consequences  from  the  loss of key  individuals.
Employees are generally not under  employment  contracts and are free to move to
competitors. The Company believes that its compensation arrangements for its key
employees,  which in  addition  to base  salaries  and  performance  bonuses may
include  stock  options,  restricted  stock and  retirement  plans,  are  highly
competitive with those of other advertising  agencies.  As of December 31, 1998,
the Omnicom Group, excluding  unconsolidated  companies,  employed approximately
35,600 persons, of which approximately 15,300 were employed in the United States
and approximately 20,300 were employed in its international offices.

Government Regulation

      The Company's  business is subject to government  regulation,  both within
and outside the United States.  In the United States,  federal,  state and local
governments  and their  agencies and various  consumer  groups have  directly or
indirectly  affected  or  attempted  to affect the scope,  content and manner of
presentation  of  advertising.  The  continued  activity  by  government  and by
consumer  groups  regarding  advertising  may cause  further  change in domestic
advertising  practices  in the  coming  years.  While the  Company  is unable to
estimate  the  effect of




these developments on its U.S. business, management believes the total volume of
advertising in general media in the United States will not be materially reduced
due to future  legislation or  regulation,  even though the form,  content,  and
manner of presentation of advertising may be modified. In addition,  the Company
will continue to ensure that its management and operating personnel are aware of
and are responsive to the possible implications of such developments.

Item 2. Properties

      Substantially all of the Company's offices are located in leased premises.
The Company  actively  manages its lease  obligations  and,  where  appropriate,
consolidates its leased premises.  Management has obtained subleases for most of
the premises vacated. Where appropriate, management has established reserves for
the  difference  between the cost of the leased  premises  that were vacated and
anticipated sublease income.

Domestic

      The Company's  corporate office occupies  approximately  50,000 sq. ft. of
space at 437 Madison  Avenue,  New York,  New York under a lease expiring in the
year 2010.

      Offices in  Atlanta,  Boston,  Chicago,  Coral  Gables,  Dallas,  Detroit,
Houston,  Irvine,  Kansas City, Los Angeles,  Minneapolis,  New York, Palo Alto,
Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Stamford, St. Louis
and  Washington  D.C. and at various other  locations  occupy  approximately  an
aggregate  of 5,018,000  sq. ft. of space under  leases with varying  expiration
dates.

International

      The Company's international  subsidiaries in Australia,  Austria, Belgium,
Brazil,  Bulgaria,  Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic,  Denmark,
Estonia,  Finland,  France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland,

Republic,  South  Africa,  South  Korea,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Taiwan,

expiration dates.

      In 1996,  domestic  revenues  from  commissions  and fees  increased  23.9
percent.  The effect of acquisitions,  net of divestitures,  accounted for a 7.4

from existing clients.

      In 1998,  international  revenues  increased  32.2 percent.  The effect of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  accounted  for a 20.8 percent  increase in
international revenues. Changes in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar
decreased  international  revenues by 2.9 percent.  The  remaining  14.3 percent
increase  was  due to the  growth  of  existing  businesses,  including  net new
business gains and higher net spending from existing clients.

      In 1997,  international  revenues  increased  19.9 percent.  The effect of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  accounted  for a 16.2 percent  increase in
international revenues. Changes in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar
decreased  international  revenues by 10.3 percent.  The remaining  14.0 percent
increase  was  due to the  growth  of  existing  businesses,  including  net new
business gains and higher net spending from existing clients.




      In 1996,  international  revenues  increased  10.3 percent.  The effect of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  accounted  for a 3.2  percent  increase in
international revenues. Changes in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar
decreased  international  revenues by 3.4 percent.  The  remaining  10.5 percent
increase  was  due to the  growth  of  existing  businesses,  including  net new
business gains and higher net spending from existing clients.

      In  1998,   worldwide   operating   expenses   increased   29.8   percent.
Acquisitions,  net of divestitures during the year, accounted for a 16.5 percent
increase in worldwide operating expenses.  Changes in the foreign exchange value
of the U.S. dollar decreased  worldwide  operating expenses by 1.3 percent.  The
remaining 14.6 percent increase was caused by normal salary increases and growth
in out-of-pocket expenditures to service the increased revenue base. Net foreign
exchange gains did not significantly impact operating expenses for the year.

      In  1997,   worldwide   operating   expenses   increased   17.5   percent.
Acquisitions,  net of divestitures during the year,  accounted for a 7.9 percent
increase in worldwide operating expenses.  Changes in the foreign exchange value
of the U.S. dollar decreased  worldwide  operating expenses by 4.7 percent.  The
remaining 14.3 percent increase was caused by normal salary increases and growth
in out-of-pocket expenditures to service the increased revenue base. Net foreign
exchange gains did not significantly impact operating expenses for the year.

      In  1996,   worldwide   operating   expenses   increased   16.5   percent.
Acquisitions,  net of divestitures during the year,  accounted for a 4.9 percent
increase in worldwide operating expenses.  Changes in the foreign exchange value
of the U.S. dollar decreased  worldwide  operating expenses by 1.6 percent.  The
remaining   13.2   percent   increase   was  caused  by  increases  in  employee
compensation,   including  relatively  higher  levels  of  bonus  and  incentive
compensation and severance payments, and growth in out-of-pocket expenditures to
service  the  increased  revenue  base.  Net  foreign  exchange  gains  did  not
significantly impact operating expenses for the year.

      Net  interest  expense in 1998  increased  $17.7  million.  This  increase
primarily reflects higher average borrowings during the year,  resulting in part
from the issuance of the 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures and the 5.20%
French franc Notes,  partially offset by the effect of higher average amounts of
cash and marketable securities invested during the year.

      Net interest expense in 1997 increased $1.0 million.  The effect of higher
average  borrowings during the year,  resulting in part from the issuance of the
41/4% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures,  was offset by the effect of higher
average amounts of cash and marketable securities invested during the year.

      Net interest  expense in 1996  decreased  $6.9  million,  due primarily to
lower average  interest rates on borrowings and the conversion of the 4.5%/6.25%
Step-Up Convertible Subordinated Debentures in September 1996.

      In 1998,  the effective tax rate  increased to 41.5 percent.  The increase
primarily  reflects  higher  effective tax rates at the Company's  international
subsidiaries.

      In 1997, the effective tax rate  increased to 41.0 percent.  This increase
primarily  reflects  higher  effective tax rates at the Company's  international
subsidiaries.

      In 1996, the effective tax rate  increased to 40.5 percent.  This increase
reflects an increase in the effective rate of state and local taxes.

      In 1998, consolidated net income increased 28.2 percent. This increase was
the result of  revenue  growth and  margin  improvement,  partially  offset by a
decrease  in  equity  income  and an  increase  in  minority  interest  expense.
Operating margin, which excludes net interest expense, increased to 13.7 percent
in 1998 from 12.9  percent in 1997 as a result of greater  growth in  commission
and fee revenue  than the growth in operating  expenses.  The decrease in equity
income  was  primarily  due  to  the  conversion  of  certain   affiliates  into
subsidiaries  and to  decreased  earnings  at  certain of the  Company's  equity
affiliates.  The  increase  in  minority  interest  expense was caused by higher
earnings  from  companies  in which  minority  interests  exist  and  additional
minority  interests  resulting  from  acquisitions.   In  1998,  the  impact  of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  resulted  in a 13.5  percent  increase  in
consolidated net income, while changes in the foreign exchange value of the U.S.
dollar decreased consolidated net income by 1.9 percent.

      In 1997, consolidated net income increased 26.1 percent. This increase was
the result of revenue  growth,  margin  improvement,  and an  increase in equity
income, partially offset by an increase in minority interest expense.  Operating
margin,  which excludes net interest expense,  increased to 12.9 percent in 1997
from 12.4 percent in 1996 as a result of greater  growth in  commission  and fee
revenue than the growth in operating 




expenses.  The increase in equity income was  primarily  due to greater  profits
earned by the Company's  existing  equity  affiliates.  The increase in minority
interest  expense was caused by higher earnings from companies in which minority
interests exist and additional  minority interests  resulting from acquisitions.
In 1997, the impact of  acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  resulted in a 16.0
percent  increase  in  consolidated  net  income,  while  changes in the foreign
exchange  value of the U.S.  dollar  decreased  consolidated  net  income by 5.0
percent.

      In 1996, consolidated net income increased 26.0 percent. This increase was
the result of revenue growth and margin  improvement.  Operating  margin,  which
excludes  net  interest  expense,  increased  to 12.4  percent in 1996 from 12.0
percent in 1995 as a result of greater growth in commission and fee revenue than
the growth in operating  expenses.  In 1996, the impact of acquisitions,  net of
divestitures,  resulted in a 2.7 percent  increase in  consolidated  net income,
while  changes  in the  foreign  exchange  value  of the U.S.  dollar  decreased
consolidated net income by 2.4 percent.

      At December 31, 1998,  accounts  receivable  less  allowance  for doubtful
accounts,  increased by $666.4  million from  December 31, 1997. At December 31,
1998, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased by $676.8 million
and $366.9 million,  respectively,  from December 31, 1997. These increases were
primarily due to an increased volume of activity  resulting from business growth
and  acquisitions  during  the  year  and,  in the  case  of  accounts  payable,
differences  in the timing of payments to media and other  suppliers  in 1998 as
compared to 1997.

      The Company is subject to the risk of currency  exchange rate fluctuations
related to its international  operations.  This risk is generally limited to the
net income of the  operations as the revenues and expenses of the operations are
generally  denominated  in the same currency.  The Company or its  international
operations  may in some cases enter into  hedging  transactions  to minimize the
risk of adverse  currency  exchange rate  fluctuations  on the net income of the
operation.  The Company's  major  international  markets are Australia,  Brazil,
Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.

      As part of managing  the  Company's  exposures  to currency  exchange  and
market interest rates, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial
instruments.   Derivative  financial  instruments  are  subject  to  market  and
counterparty  risk. Market risk is the potential for loss resulting from changes
in market  conditions.  The Company  periodically  determines the potential loss
from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. Value-at-risk uses a
statistical  model that utilizes  historic  currency  exchange and interest rate
data to  measure  the  potential  impact on  future  earnings  of the  Company's
existing  portfolio  of  derivative  financial  instruments.  The  value-at-risk
analysis  performed on the Company's  December 31, 1998  portfolio of derivative
financial   instruments   indicated  that  the  risk  of  loss  was  immaterial.
Counterparty  risk  arises  from the  inability  of a  counterparty  to meet its
obligations.  To  minimize  counterparty  risk,  the  Company  only  enters into
derivative  contracts with major well-known banks that have credit ratings equal
to or better than the Company's.

      The Company's derivative  activities are limited in volume and confined to
risk management  activities  related to the Company's  worldwide  operations.  A
reporting  system  is in place  which  evaluates  the  impact  on the  Company's
earnings  resulting from changes in interest rates,  currency exchange rates and
other  relevant  market  risks.  This  system is  structured  to  enable  senior
management to initiate prompt remedial action, if appropriate.

      At December 31, 1998 and 1997,  the Company had forward  foreign  exchange
contracts  outstanding  with an  aggregate  notional  principal  amount  of $865
million and $584 million,  respectively,  most of which were  denominated in the
Company's major international market currencies.  These contracts  predominantly
hedge certain of the Company's  intercompany  receivables and payables which are
recorded in a currency  different from that in which they will settle. The terms
of these contracts are generally three months or less.

      At December 31, 1998, the Company had Japanese yen 16.3 billion  aggregate
notional  principal  amount of cross  currency  interest  rate swaps.  The swaps
convert a portion of the  Company's  U.S.  dollar  floating rate debt into fixed
rate Japanese yen debt and  effectively  hedge the  Company's net  investment in
Japanese yen denominated assets.

      At  December  31,  1998 and  1997,  the  Company  had no other  derivative
contracts outstanding.




Year 2000 Issue

      The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using
two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable year. Accordingly, any of
the computer programs utilized by the Company that have date sensitive  software
may cause system failures or miscalculations if data entry of "00" is recognized
as a date other than 2000.

      The Company has developed a Year 2000  readiness plan to address Year 2000
issues.  This plan has included  the  establishment  of Omnicom  2000, a special
purpose entity  dedicated to ensuring that Omnicom  companies are addressing and
resolving  Year 2000  compliance  issues.  Omnicom  2000  comprises an Executive
Committee of senior executives from Omnicom and its principal subsidiaries,  and
a team of dedicated  internal  managers and  consultants.  Omnicom 2000 has also
retained external  managers and consultants to assist in project  management and
quality  control.  The Company's  plan includes an assessment  phase,  a testing
phase, an implementation phase and a contingency  planning phase.  Additionally,
the Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  meets  periodically  to review
progress against the plan.

      As part of its  assessment  phase,  the  Company  has  compiled a detailed
inventory  of systems and  potential  Year 2000  readiness  issues at all of its
principal locations. Based on this information,  the Company has determined that
it is required to modify  portions of its software so that its computer  systems
will properly  utilize dates beyond December 31, 1999. In addition,  the Company
is dependent on third-party computer systems and applications, particularly with
respect to such tasks as accounting, billing and buying, planning and paying for
media. The Company is in the process of modifying or replacing affected systems,
and is also evaluating the adequacy of the processes and progress of third-party
vendors of systems  that may be  affected  by the Year 2000  issue.  The Company
believes that it has identified critical  third-party  vendors,  and it recently
completed  its testing of these  critical  vendors to determine  their Year 2000
readiness.  The Company  has been  working  with and will  continue to work with
these and other  vendors and  believes  they will be Year 2000  compliant.  As a
result of the above, the assessment phase is nearly complete.  Additionally, the
Company believes that the  implementation  phase of its Year 2000 readiness plan
will be substantially completed by the middle of 1999. Contingency planning will
continue throughout 1999.

      The  Company  believes  that,   through   upgrades,   modifications,   and
replacement  of its  existing  hardware,  software and non-IT  systems,  it will
achieve  Year 2000  readiness.  However,  if such  upgrades,  modifications  and
replacements  are not made,  or are not made in a timely  manner,  the Year 2000
issue could have a material impact on the Company's operations.

      The  out-of-pocket  costs  incurred in 1998 for its Year 2000 program were
not  material  to  consolidated  results of  operations  and are  expected to be
immaterial   in  1999.   These  costs,   the  majority  of  which  will  not  be
capitalizable,   include  third  party   consultants  and  the  replacement  and
remediation  of  existing  computer  software  and  hardware.  Such costs do not
include internal  management time, the effects of which are also not expected to
be material to the Company's results of operations or financial  condition.  The
Company  will  continue  to refine its  estimates  of the costs of its Year 2000
efforts,  through  progress  reports from each  location and through its capital
expenditure budget review process.

      At this stage of the process, the Company believes that it is difficult to
specifically  identify  the cause of the most  reasonable  worst  case Year 2000
scenario.  Due to  the  decentralized  nature  of the  Company's  structure  and
systems,  the Company  believes  that a  reasonable  worst case  scenario  could
involve the failures of significant third parties (including entities with which
the Company has no direct involvement such as  telecommunications  companies and
public  utilities)  that  continue  for more  than  several  days  and  affect a
significant  number  of  the  Company's  operating  locations.  The  Company  is
considering  various  contingency  planning  approaches  in the  event  of  such
failures and is currently  developing a plan for its operations to follow in the
event of a Year 2000 failure. The development of the Company's contingency plans
will be ongoing and will  reflect  additional  information  with regard to third
parties' Year 2000 readiness as it is received.

      The Company's  Year 2000 efforts are ongoing and its overall plan, as well
as the  consideration  of  contingency  plans,  will  continue  to evolve as new
information becomes available.  While the Company anticipates  continuity of its
business activities, that continuity will be dependent upon its ability, and the
ability  of  third  parties  with  whom  the  Company  relies  on  directly,  or
indirectly, to be Year 2000 compliant.




Capital Resources and Liquidity

      Cash and cash  equivalents  increased  $91.6 million during 1998 to $648.0
million at December 31, 1998.  The Company's  positive net cash flow provided by
operating  activities  was  maintained.  After annual cash outlays for dividends
paid to shareholders and minority  interests and the repurchase of the Company's
common stock for employee programs,  the balance of the cash flow, together with
the  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  debt  obligations,   was  used  to  fund
acquisitions, make capital expenditures and repay debt obligations.

      On June 24, 1998, the Company issued French franc 1 billion (approximately
$164 million at the June 24, 1998 exchange rate) of 5.20% Notes with a scheduled
maturity in 2005.

      On March 4, 1998, the Company issued  4,000,000 shares of common stock for
aggregate proceeds before expenses of $171.4 million.

      On January 6, 1998, the Company issued $230.0 million of 21/4% Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity in 2013. The debentures are
convertible into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $49.83 per
share subject to adjustment in certain events.  Debenture holders have the right
to require the Company to redeem the debentures on January 6, 2004 at a price of
118.968%,  or upon the  occurrence  of a Fundamental  Change,  as defined in the
indenture agreement,  at the prevailing redemption price. The Company may redeem
the  debentures,  as a whole or in part, on or after December 31, 2001 initially
at 112.841% and at increasing  prices  thereafter  to 118.968%  until January 6,
2004,  and 100%  thereafter.  Unless the  debentures  are redeemed,  repaid,  or
converted prior thereto,  the debentures will mature on January 6, 2013 at their
principal amount.

      On January 3, 1997, the Company issued $218.5 million of 41/4% Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity in 2007. The debentures are
convertible into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $31.50 per
share subject to adjustment in certain events.  Debenture holders have the right
to require the Company to redeem the debentures on January 3, 2003 at a price of
112.418%,  or upon the  occurrence  of a Fundamental  Change,  as defined in the
indenture agreement,  at the prevailing redemption price. The Company may redeem
the  debentures,  as a whole or in part, on or after December 29, 2000 initially
at 108.324% and at increasing  prices  thereafter  to 112.418%  until January 2,
2003,  and 100%  thereafter.  Unless  the  debentures  are  redeemed,  repaid or
converted prior thereto,  the debentures will mature on January 3, 2007 at their
principal amount.

      On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  issued a Notice  of  Redemption  for the
outstanding  4.5%/6.25% Step-Up  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures issued on
September 1, 1993 with a scheduled  maturity in 2000.  Prior to the September 5,
1996  redemption  date,  the debenture  holders  elected to convert all of their
outstanding debentures into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of
$13.72 per common share.

      On March 1, 1996,  the Company issued  Deutsche Mark 100 million  Floating
Rate Bonds  (approximately  $68 million at the March 1, 1996 exchange  rate) due
March 1,  1999.  The  bonds are  unsecured,  unsubordinated  obligations  of the
Company and bear interest at a per annum rate equal to Deutsche Mark three month
LIBOR plus 0.375%. The bonds matured on March 1, 1999 and were repaid at par.

      The  Company  maintains  relationships  with a number of banks  worldwide,
which have extended unsecured committed lines of credit in amounts sufficient to
meet the  Company's  cash needs.  At  December  31,  1998,  the Company had $701
million in such unsecured committed lines of credit, comprised of a $500 million
revolving credit agreement  expiring June 30, 2003, and $201 million in lines of
credit,  principally  outside  of the  United  States.  Of the $701  million  in
unsecured  committed  lines,  $35  million  were  used  at  December  31,  1998.
Management  believes the aggregate lines of credit  available to the Company are
adequate  to support  its  short-term  cash  requirements  including  dividends,
capital expenditures,  acquisitions,  debt repayments and maintenance of working
capital.

      The Company anticipates that the year end cash position, together with the
future cash flows from  operations and funds  available  under  existing  credit
facilities will be adequate to meet its long-term cash requirements as presently
contemplated.

internal  audits,  is designed to provide  reasonable  assurance that assets are
safeguarded  and records are  maintained  to  substantiate  the  preparation  of
accurate financial information.  Underlying this concept of reasonable assurance
is the premise that the cost of control  should not exceed the benefits  derived
therefrom.

       The  financial   statements  have  been  audited  by  independent  public
accountants.  Their report expresses an independent  informed judgment as to the
fairness of management's  reported operating  results,  cash flows and financial
position.  This  judgment  is based on the  procedures  described  in the second
paragraph of their report.

      The Audit Committee meets  periodically with  representatives of financial
management, internal audit and the independent public accountants to assure that
each is properly  discharging their  responsibilities.  Additionally,  the Audit
Committee has met  periodically  to review  progress  against the Company's Year
2000  readiness  plan.  In order to  ensure  complete  independence,  the  Audit
Committee  communicates  directly and  separately  with the  independent  public
accountants,  internal audit and financial  management to discuss the results of
their audits,  the adequacy of internal  accounting  controls and the quality of
financial reporting.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
  Shareholders of Omnicom Group Inc.:

      We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Omnicom
Group Inc. (a New York corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and
1997, and the related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,
1998. These consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule based
on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  financial  position of Omnicom  Group Inc. and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1998  and  1997,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

      Our  audits  were made for the  purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule on page S-1 is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  fairly states in all material  respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

      Business.  Omnicom  Group,  Inc.,  through its wholly and  partially-owned
companies,  provides corporate communications services to clients worldwide on a
global,  pan-regional,  national  and local  basis.  Operations  cover the major
regions of North America, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America,
the Far East, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. The communications services
offered by the Company  include the  creation  and  production  of  advertising,
marketing  consultation,  strategic  media  planning and buying,  financial  and
business-to-business    advertising,    directory    advertising,     healthcare
communications,  managed care consultancy, recruitment communications,  branding
consultancy,  digital  communications,  contract  publishing,  design  and image
consultancy,  direct/database marketing, field marketing, integrated promotional
marketing, public affairs, corporate and financial public relations,  reputation
management, sports and event marketing,  telemarketing, and internet and digital
media development.

      Recognition of Commission and Fee Revenue.  Substantially all revenues are
derived from  commissions for placement of  advertisements  in various media and
from  fees  for  manpower  and for  production  of  advertisements.  Revenue  is
generally   recognized  when  billed.   Billings  are  generally  rendered  upon
completion of the earnings process, including: upon presentation date for media,
when  manpower  is used,  when  costs are  incurred  for  radio  and  television
production and when print production is completed.

      Principles  of  Consolidation.  The  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  include the  accounts of Omnicom  Group Inc.  and its  domestic  and
international   subsidiaries  (the  "Company").   All  significant  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

      Restatements and Reclassifications.  All prior year amounts give effect to
a  two-for-one  stock split in the form of a 100% stock  dividend  completed  in
December 1997. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the 1998 presentation.

      Investments  Available-For-Sale.  Investments  available-for-sale  consist
principally of time deposits with financial institutions.  These investments are
generally  redeemed at face value upon maturity and, as such, gains or losses on
disposition are immaterial.  There are no material  unrealized  holding gains or
losses as of December 31, 1998.

      Billable  Production.   Billable  production  orders  in  process  consist
principally of costs incurred in providing  communications  services to clients.
Such amounts are generally  billed to clients when manpower is used,  when costs
are incurred for radio and television  production  and when print  production is
completed.

      Common  Stock.  Wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  have  issued
securities  which are  exchangeable  into  common  stock of the  Company  at the
holders'  option.  Shares of common  stock  issuable  on the  exchange  of these
securities are included in common stock issued at December 31, 1998.

      Treasury Stock. The Company accounts for treasury share purchases at cost.
The reissuance of treasury shares is accounted for at the average cost. Gains or
losses on the  reissuance  of treasury  shares are  accounted  for as additional
paid-in capital.

      Foreign  Currency  Translation.  The Company's  financial  statements were
prepared  in  accordance  with  the   requirements  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." Under this
method, net transaction gains of $8.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.5 million are
included in 1998, 1997 and 1996 net income, respectively.

      Earnings  Per Common  Share.  Basic  earnings  per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding  during each year. Diluted
earnings  per share is based on the  above,  plus,  if  dilutive,  common  share
equivalents  which include  outstanding  options and restricted  shares,  and if
dilutive,  adjusted  for the assumed  conversion  of the  Company's  Convertible
Subordinated Debentures and the assumed increase in net income for the after tax
interest cost of these  debentures.  In determining  for the year ended December
31, 1998, if the Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures were dilutive,  the 21/4%
and 41/4% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures were assumed to be converted for
the full year.  For the year ended  December  31,  1997,  the 41/4%  Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures were assumed to be converted for the full year. For the
year ended December 31, 1996, the 4.5%/6.25%  Step-Up  Convertible  Subordinated
Debentures  were assumed to be

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

converted through September 5, 1996, when they were converted into common stock.
For  purposes  of  computing  diluted  earnings  per share  for the years  ended
December  31,  1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively,  3,223,200,  3,128,300  and
2,813,400 shares were assumed to have been  outstanding  related to common share
equivalents and 6,936,500,  6,936,500 and 7,240,700  shares were assumed to have
been converted  related to the Company's  convertible  subordinated  debentures.
Additionally,  the assumed  increase in net income used in the  computations was
$9,627,900,  $9,631,300  and  $5,134,400  for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.  The number of shares used in the computations were
as follows:

                                            1998          1997          1996
                                            ----          ----          ----
Basic EPS computation................    165,684,600   159,418,700   151,329,300
Diluted EPS computation..............    175,844,300   169,483,500   161,383,400

      For  purposes of computing  diluted  earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 1998, the Company's 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were
not  reflected  in  the   computation  as  their   inclusion   would  have  been
anti-dilutive.

      Severance  Agreements.   Arrangements  with  certain  present  and  former
employees  provide  for  continuing  payments  for  periods up to 10 years after
cessation of their full-time  employment in consideration  for agreements by the
employees  not to  compete  and  to  render  consulting  services  in  the  post
employment  period.  Such  payments,  which are  determined,  subject to certain
conditions and limitations,  by earnings in subsequent periods,  are expensed in
such periods.

      Depreciation  of Furniture  and Equipment  and  Amortization  of Leasehold
Improvements.  Depreciation  charges are  computed on a  straight-line  basis or
declining  balance  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of  furniture  and
equipment,   up  to  10  years.   Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the lesser of the terms of the  related  lease or the
useful life of these assets.

      Intangibles. Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair
value of tangible net assets of purchased  subsidiaries.  The intangible  values
associated with the Company's  business consist  predominantly of two types: the
value  of the  worldwide  agency  networks  and  the  value  of  ongoing  client
relationships.  The Company's  worldwide agency networks have been operating for
an average of over sixty years and intangibles associated with enhancing network
value are  intended  to  enhance  the long term  value of the  networks.  Client
relationships in the corporate  communications  services  industry are typically
long term in nature and the  Company's  largest  clients  have on  average  been
clients for more than twenty-five years. As such, intangibles are amortized on a
straight-line  basis  principally  over a period of forty years.  Each year, the
intangibles  are written down if, and to the extent,  they are  determined to be
impaired.  Intangibles  are considered to be impaired if the future  anticipated
undiscounted cash flows arising from the use of the intangibles is less than the
net unamortized cost of the intangibles.

      Deferred  Taxes.  Deferred tax  liabilities and tax benefits relate to the
recognition  of certain  revenues and expenses in different  years for financial
statement and tax purposes and to differences  between the tax and book basis of
assets and liabilities recorded in connection with acquisitions.

      Cash Flows.  The Company's  cash  equivalents  are primarily  comprised of
investments in overnight interest-bearing  deposits,  commercial paper and money
market instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less.

      The following  supplemental schedule summarizes the fair value of non-cash
assets  acquired,  cash paid,  common shares  issued  (valued at the then market
value  of the  shares)  and the  liabilities  assumed  in  connection  with  the
acquisition of equity interests in subsidiaries and affiliates,  for each of the
three years ended December 31:

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      During 1996,  the Company  issued  10,477,356  shares of common stock upon
conversion of $143,750,000 of its 4.5%/6.25%  Step-Up  Convertible  Subordinated
Debentures.

      Concentration   of  Credit   Risk  .  The   Company   provides   corporate
communications  services to a wide range of clients who operate in many industry
sectors around the world.  The Company  grants credit to all qualified  clients,
but does not believe it is exposed to any undue  concentration of credit risk to
any significant degree.

      Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments consist
principally of forward foreign  exchange  contracts and interest rate swaps. For
derivative  financial  instruments to qualify for hedge accounting the following
criteria must be met: (a) the hedging  instrument must be designated as a hedge;
(b) the hedged exposure must be specifically identifiable and expose the Company
to risk;  and (c) it must be highly  probable that a change in fair value of the
derivative  financial instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the
hedged  exposure  will have a high degree of  correlation.  The  majority of the
Company's derivative activity relates to forward foreign exchange contracts. The
Company  executes these  contracts in the same currency as the hedged  exposure,
whereby 100% correlation is achieved.  Gains and losses on derivative  financial
instruments  which are hedges of existing  assets or liabilities are included in
the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately recognized
in income as part of those  carrying  amounts.  Interest  received  and/or  paid
arising from swap  agreements  which qualify as hedges are  recognized in income
when the interest is receivable  or payable.  Derivative  financial  instruments
which do not qualify as hedges are  revalued to the current  market rate and any
gains or losses are recorded in income in the current period.

      Use of Estimates.  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2.  Acquisitions

      In   January   1998,   the   Company   completed   the   acquisitions   of
Fleishman-Hillard,  Inc., GPC International Holdings Inc. and Palmer Jarvis Inc.
These acquisitions were accounted for under the  pooling-of-interests  method of
accounting  and,  accordingly,  the results of operations  of  Fleishman-Hillard
Inc., GPC International  Holdings Inc. and Palmer Jarvis Inc. have been included
in the  consolidated  financial  statements  since  January 1, 1998.  Prior year
consolidated  financial statements were not restated as the impact on such years
was not material.  The number of shares issued by the Company in connection with
these acquisitions is 3,550,366.

      In February 1997, the Company  completed the acquisitions of Cline Davis &
Mann, Inc. and Gavin Anderson & Company (Japan), Inc. Both of these acquisitions
were  accounted for under the  pooling-of-interests  method of  accounting  and,
accordingly,  the results of  operations  of Cline Davis & Mann,  Inc. and Gavin
Anderson  &  Company  (Japan),  Inc.  have  been  included  in the  consolidated
financial  statements since January 1, 1997. Prior year  consolidated  financial
statements  were not  restated as the impact on such years was not  material.  A
total of 1,088,974  shares of common stock were issued in connection  with these
acquisitions.

      In  May  1996,   the  Company   completed  the   acquisition   of  Ketchum
Communications  Holdings,  Inc.  ("Ketchum").  The acquisition was accounted for
under  the  pooling-of-interests  method of  accounting  and,  accordingly,  the
results  of  operations  of  Ketchum  have  been  included  in the  consolidated
financial  statements since January 1, 1996. Prior year  consolidated  financial
statements  were not  restated as the impact on such years was not  material.  A
total of 2,413,706 shares were issued in connection with this acquisition.

      During 1998, the Company made several other  acquisitions  whose aggregate
cost,  in cash or by issuance of the  Company's  common  stock,  totaled  $872.6
million for net assets,  which included intangible assets of $833.5 million. Due
to the nature of corporate  communications  services  companies,  the  companies
acquired by Omnicom Group  generally  have tangible net  liabilities  or minimal
tangible  net assets.  The  majority of the  purchase  price is paid for ongoing
client  relationships  and to enhance the competitive  position of the Company's
worldwide agency brands. Included in both figures are payments of $102.3 million
made in 1998 related to acquisitions completed in prior years.


                                      F-9


                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      Certain acquisitions completed in 1998 and prior years require payments in
future  years if  certain  results  are  achieved  by the  companies  that  were
acquired.  Formulas for these contingent future payments differ from acquisition
to  acquisition.  Contingent  future payments are not expected to be material to
the Company's results of operations or financial position.

3.  Bank Loans and Lines of Credit

      Bank loans are primarily  comprised of bank  overdrafts  of  international
subsidiaries  which  are  treated  as loans  pursuant  to bank  agreements.  The
weighted average interest rate on the borrowings  outstanding as of December 31,
1998 and 1997 was 6.8% and 9.9%,  respectively.  At December  31, 1998 and 1997,
the Company had unsecured  committed lines of credit  aggregating $701.3 million
and $509.4 million,  respectively. The unused portion of credit lines was $666.0
million and $495.1  million at December  31,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  The
lines of credit are generally  extended at lending rates that the banks grant to
their most credit  worthy  borrowers.  Material  compensating  balances  are not
required within the terms of these credit agreements.

      At December 31, 1997, the committed  lines of credit included $360 million
under a revolving  credit  agreement  expiring June 30, 2001. As of February 20,
1998, the $360 million revolving credit agreement was replaced by a $500 million
revolving credit  agreement  expiring June 30, 2003. Due to the long-term nature
of these credit agreements,  borrowings under the agreements would be classified
as  long-term  debt.  There were no  borrowings  under  these  revolving  credit
agreements at December 31, 1998 and 1997.

      The revolving credit agreement  includes a facility for issuing commercial
paper  backed by a bank letter of credit.  During the years ended  December  31,
1998,  1997 and 1996,  the  Company  issued  commercial  paper  with an  average
original  maturity  of 11,  16 and 26 days,  respectively.  The  Company  had no
commercial paper borrowings  outstanding as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
The maximum outstanding during the year was $265 million,  $235 million and $230
million, in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The gross amount of issuance and
redemption  during  the year was $ 4,231  million,  $2,017  million  and  $1,710
million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

4.  Employee Stock Plans

      Effective   March  24,  1998,  the  Company  adopted  the  1998  Incentive
Compensation  Plan (the "1998  Plan").  The  maximum  number of shares of common
stock of the Company that may be granted in any calendar  year,  for  restricted
stock awards and  non-qualified  stock options to key  employees  under the 1998
Plan,  is 1.5% of the  total  number  of  shares  of  common  stock  issued  and
outstanding  on the first day of that  calendar  year.  Any  remaining  reserved
shares of common stock may be carried over to  subsequent  years.  The remaining
number of such reserved shares was 2,354,173 at December 31, 1998.  Awards under
the Company's  1987 Stock Plan, as amended,  (the "1987 Plan") ceased to be made
when the Company adopted the 1998 Plan.

      Stock Options.  As permitted by SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation,"   the  Company  intends  to  continue  to  apply  the  accounting
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees,"
and to make  annual pro forma  disclosures  of the effect of  adopting  the fair
value method of accounting for employee  stock options and similar  instruments.
During the initial  periods of disclosure,  the effects on net income may not be
representative of the effects in future years due to the transitional provisions
included in SFAS No. 123.

      Pursuant  to the 1987  Plan and 1998  Plan  ("the  Plans"),  the  price of
options  awarded  may not be less than 100% of the market  value of the stock at
the date of the grant.  Options become  exercisable 30% on each of the first two
anniversary  dates of the grant  date with the  final 40%  becoming  exercisable
three years from the grant date.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      A summary of the status of the  Company's  stock option plan for the three
years ended December 31, 1998 is as follows:



      The weighted  average fair value of options  granted during 1998, 1997 and
1996 was  $11.45,  $6.27 and $4.65 per option,  respectively.  The fair value of
each  option  grant  has  been   estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

                                          1998           1997          1996
                                          ----           ----          ----
Expected option lives..............      5 years        5 years       5 years
Risk free interest rate............   4.66% - 5.75%      6.15%     5.64% - 5.99%
Expected volatility................  18.36% - 20.15%     19.7%     18.8% - 19.5%
Dividend yield.....................    0.9% - 1.0%       1.5%          1.7%

      Using  compensation  cost for the Company's stock option plan,  determined
based on the estimated fair value at the grant date for options granted in 1998,
1997 and 1996  consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the effect on the
Company's net income and income per share would have been as follows:

      All  restricted  shares  granted  under the Plans were sold at a price per
share  equal to their par value.  The  difference  between  par value and market
value  on the date of the  sale is  charged  to  shareholders'  equity  and then
amortized  to expense  over the  period of  restriction.  Under the  Plans,  the
restricted  shares become  transferable to the employee in 20% annual increments
provided the employee remains in the employ of the Company.

      Restricted  shares  may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise
encumbered until the restrictions lapse. Under most circumstances,  the employee
must  resell  the  shares to the  Company  at par value if the  employee  ceases
employment prior to the end of the period of restriction.

      The charge to operations in connection with these  restricted stock awards
for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to $ 21.5 million,
$17.3 million and $13.9 million, respectively.

Enterprise   and  Related   Information".   The   Company's   wholly-owned   and
partially-owned  businesses operate within the corporate communications services
operating segment. These businesses provide a variety of communications services

6. Investments in Affiliates

      The Company has in excess of 65  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted for
under the equity  method.  The  equity  method is used when the  Company  has an
ownership  of less  than  50%  and  exercises  significant  influence  over  the
operating  and  financial  policies  of  the  affiliate.   The  following  table
summarizes   the  balance   sheets  and  income   statements  of  the  Company's
unconsolidated affiliates, primarily in Europe and Australia, as of December 31,
1998, 1997, 1996, and for the years then ended:

Net income ........................         34,120         56,226         57,352

      The  Company's  equity in the net income of these  affiliates  amounted to
$25.1  million,  $30.1  million  and  $20.5  million  for  1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively.  The  Company's  equity  in  the  net  tangible  assets  of  these
affiliated companies was approximately $116.6 million,  $105.5 million and $97.5
million at  December  31,  1998,  1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Included in the
Company's  investments in affiliates is the excess of acquisition costs over the
fair value of tangible net assets acquired.  These excess  acquisition costs are
being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis  principally  over a period of forty
years. In 1998, the Company disposed of shares held in certain  affiliates.  The
resulting  impact  of these  sales  was not  material  to the 1998  consolidated
results of operations or financial position.

      Deferred  income taxes are provided for the temporary  difference  between
the  financial  reporting  basis  and tax  basis  of the  Company's  assets  and
liabilities.  Deferred tax benefits result  principally  from recording  certain
expenses in the financial  statements which are not currently deductible for tax
purposes  and from  differences  between  the tax and book  basis of assets  and
liabilities  recorded in connection with acquisitions.  Deferred tax liabilities
result  principally  from  expenses  which  are  currently  deductible  for  tax
purposes, but have not yet been expensed in the financial statements.

      The Company has recorded deferred tax benefits as of December 31, 1998 and
1997 of $200.3 million and $142.1 million, respectively,  related principally to
tax  deductible  intangibles,   acquisition  liabilities  and  compensation  and
severance accruals.

      The Company has recorded  deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 1998
and 1997 of $57.8 million and $49.7 million,  respectively,  related principally
to furniture and equipment depreciation.

      Deferred  tax  benefits  (liabilities)  as of  December  31, 1998 and 1997
consisted of the amounts shown below (dollars in millions):

      Net current  deferred  tax  benefits as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 were
$36.4  million and $24.3  million,  respectively,  and were  included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets.  Net non-current  deferred tax benefits as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997 were $106.0 million and $68.1 million,  respectively.
The Company has  concluded  that it is probable  that it will be able to realize
these net deferred tax benefits in future periods.

      A provision has been made for additional  income and withholding  taxes on
the  earnings  of  international   subsidiaries  and  affiliates  that  will  be
distributed.

9.  Employee Retirement Plans

      The Company's  international and domestic  subsidiaries provide retirement
benefits for their  employees  primarily  through  defined  contribution  plans.
Company  contributions  to the  plans,  which are  determined  by the  boards of
directors  of the  subsidiaries,  have been in  amounts  up to 15% (the  maximum
amount   deductible   for  federal   income  tax  purposes)  of  total  eligible
compensation  of  participating  employees.  Expenses  related to the  Company's
contributions to these plans amounted to $68.2 million,  $54.3 million and $49.8
million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      The Company's pension plans are primarily  international.  These plans are
not  required  to report  to  governmental  agencies  pursuant  to the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Substantially all of these plans
are funded by fixed  premium  payments to insurance  companies  which  undertake
legal  obligations  to provide  specific  benefits to the  individuals  covered.
Pension expense amounted to $5.2 million, $5.3 million and $4.6 million in 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.

      Certain  subsidiaries  of the Company have executive  retirement  programs
under which benefits will be paid to participants or their beneficiaries over 15
years  beginning  at age 65 or  death.  In  addition,  other  subsidiaries  have
individual  deferred  compensation  arrangements  with certain  executives which
provide for payments over varying terms upon retirement, cessation of employment
or death.

      Some of the Company's  domestic  subsidiaries  provide life  insurance and
medical  benefits  for  retired  employees.  Eligibility  requirements  vary  by
subsidiary,  but generally include  attainment of a specified  combined age plus
years of service  factor.  The costs related to these benefits were not material
to the 1998,  1997 and 1996  consolidated  results of  operations  or  financial
position.

10.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

      At December 31, 1998, the Company was committed  under  operating  leases,
principally  for office  space.  Certain  leases are subject to rent reviews and
require payment of expenses under  escalation  clauses.  Rent expense was $302.4
million  in 1998,  $235.9  million  in 1997 and  $201.1  million  in 1996  after
reduction for rents received from subleases of $14.7 million,  $12.8 million and
$11.9  million,   respectively.   Future  minimum  base  rents  under  terms  of
noncancellable  operating leases,  reduced by rents to be received from existing
noncancellable subleases, are as follows:

                                               (Dollars in Thousands)
                                      Gross Rent    Sublease Rent      Net Rent
                                      ----------    -------------      --------
1999 .........................        $238,486         $13,871         $224,615
2000 .........................         218,354           9,855          208,499
2001 .........................         190,058           7,814          182,244
2002 .........................         168,926           6,022          162,904
2003 .........................         156,238           4,683          151,555
Thereafter ...................         877,836          18,145          859,691

      The  present   value  of  the  gross  future   minimum  base  rents  under
noncancellable operating leases is $1,240.4 million.

      Where appropriate,  management has established reserves for the difference
between the cost of leased premises that were vacated and  anticipated  sublease
income.

      The Company is involved in various routine legal  proceedings  incident to
the ordinary  course of its business.  The Company  believes that the outcome of
all pending legal  proceedings  and unasserted  claims in the aggregate will not
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations,  consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

11.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

      The  following  table  presents the carrying  amounts and  estimated  fair
values of the  Company's  financial  instruments  at December 31, 1998 and 1997.
Amounts in parentheses represent liabilities.

                                                             

      The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial  instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale:

      Cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale consist principally of
investments in short-term,  interest bearing instruments and are carried at fair
market value, which approximates cost.

Long-term investments:

      Included in deferred  charges and other assets are  long-term  investments
carried at cost, which approximates estimated fair value.

Long-term debt:

      A portion of the Company's long-term debt included floating rate debt, the
carrying value of which  approximates  fair value. The Company's  long-term debt
also included  convertible  subordinated  debentures and fixed rate senior debt.
The fair value of these  instruments  was  determined by reference to quotations
available  in markets  where these issues were traded.  The  quotations  for the
subordinated   debentures  primarily  reflected  the  conversion  value  of  the
debentures into the Company's common stock.

Financial Commitments:

      The  estimated  fair  values  of  derivative   positions  are  based  upon
quotations  received from  independent,  third party banks and represent the net
amount  required to terminate the  position,  taking into  consideration  market
rates and  counterparty  credit risk. The fair values of guarantees  principally
related to affiliated companies,  and letters of credit were based upon the face
value of the underlying instruments.

12.  Financial Instruments and Market Risk

      The Company utilizes  derivative  financial  instruments  predominantly to
reduce certain market risks to which the Company is exposed.  These market risks
primarily  consist of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets
and  liabilities  of non-U.S.  operations  and the impact of changes in interest
rates on debt.  The Company's  derivative  activities  are limited in volume and
confined  to  risk  management  activities.  Senior  management  at the  Company
actively  participates  in the  quantification,  monitoring  and  control of all
significant  risks. A reporting system is in place which evaluates the impact on
the  Company's  earnings  resulting  from  changes in interest  rates,  currency
exchange  rates and other  relevant  market risks.  This system is structured to


                                      F-18


                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

enable senior  management to initiate  prompt remedial  action,  if appropriate.
Adequate  segregation of duties exists with regard to the  execution,  recording
and monitoring of derivative activities. Additionally, senior management reports
periodically  to the  Audit  Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors  concerning
derivative activities.  Since 1993, the Audit Committee established  limitations
on derivative activities which are reviewed annually.

      At December 31, 1998, the Company had Japanese yen 16.3 billion  aggregate
notional  principal  amount of cross  currency  interest  rate swaps.  The swaps
convert a portion of the  Company's  U.S.  dollar  floating rate debt into fixed
rate Japanese yen debt and  effectively  hedge the  Company's net  investment in
Japanese yen denominated assets.

      There were no swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 1997.

      The Company enters into forward foreign exchange  contracts  predominantly
to hedge intercompany  receivables and payables which are recorded in a currency
different  from  that in which  they  will  settle.  Gains  and  losses on these
positions  are  deferred  and  included  in the  basis of the  transaction  upon
settlement.  The terms of these contracts are generally three months or less. At
December 31, 1998 and 1997, the aggregate amount of intercompany receivables and
payables  subject to this  hedge  program  was $628  million  and $532  million,
respectively.  The  table  below  summarizes  by  major  currency  the  notional
principal   amounts  of  the  Company's   forward  foreign  exchange   contracts
outstanding at December 31, 1998 and 1997. The "buy" amounts  represent the U.S.
dollar  equivalent of commitments to purchase the respective  currency,  and the
"sell" amounts  represent the U.S. dollar  equivalent of commitments to sell the
respective currency.



      The  derivative  financial  instruments  existing  during the years  ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997 were entered into for the purpose of hedging  certain
specific  currency  and  interest  rate  risks.  As a result of these  financial
instruments,  the Company  reduced  financial risk in exchange for foregoing any
gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. In using
derivative  financial  instruments,   management  exchanged  the  risks  of  the
financial  markets for  counterparty  risk.  To minimize  counterparty  risk the
Company only enters into derivative  contracts with major  well-known banks that
have credit ratings equal to or better than the Company's.

13. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

      In June 1998,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No.
133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities" which the
Company is required to adopt  effective  January 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 cannot be
applied  retroactively.  SFAS  No.  133  establishes  accounting  and  reporting
standards  requiring  that  every  derivative   instrument   (including  certain
derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at its fair value.  SFAS No. 133
requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting  criteria are met. Special  accounting
for qualifying  hedges allows a derivative's  gains and losses to offset related
results on the hedged item in the income statement,  and requires that a company
must formally document,  designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions
that receive hedge accounting. Once implemented, SFAS No. 133 must be applied to
(a) derivative  instruments and (b) certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
hybrid contracts that were issued,  acquired,  or  substantively  modified after
December 31, 1997.

      The  Company  intends to adopt SFAS No.  133 for its  fiscal  year  ending
December  31,  2000.  The  impact  of SFAS No.  133 on the  Company's  financial
statements will depend on a variety of factors,  including future interpretative
guidance from the FASB, the future level  forecasted and actual foreign currency
transactions,  the  extent of the  Company's  hedging  activities,  the types of
hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such instruments. However, the
Company does not believe the effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 will be material to
its financial position.

14. Subsequent Event

      On February 10, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of Abbott Mead
Vickers plc ("AMV"). AMV provides corporate  communications  services to clients
principally in the United Kingdom.  The Company issued approximately 9.6 million
new shares of common stock in exchange for the 92.3% of AMV ordinary  shares not
already owned by the Company,  at a fixed  exchange ratio of .1347 common shares
of the Company per AMV ordinary  share.  The  transaction  will be accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting.
