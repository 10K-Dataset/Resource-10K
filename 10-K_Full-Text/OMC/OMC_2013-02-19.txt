PART I

Introduction

This report is both our 2012 annual report to shareholders and our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K required under the federal securities laws.

We are a strategic holding company, providing professional services to clients through multiple agencies operating in all major markets around the world. Our companies provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services. The terms “Omnicom,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Omnicom Group Inc. and our subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

Item 1.

Business

Our Business:

Omnicom, a strategic holding company, was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising, marketing and corporate communications companies. We are a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications company. We operate in a highly competitive industry. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums, has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as Omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures.

Our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services, which we group into four fundamental disciplines: advertising, customer relationship management, or CRM, public relations and specialty communications. The services included in these disciplines are:

Although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines, we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing client-specific consulting services.

Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. The fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients. As clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency, they have tended to consolidate their business with larger, multi-disciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies. Accordingly, our business model demands that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements. We believe that this organizational philosophy, and our ability to execute it, differentiates us from our competitors.


Our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies. This means that the delivery of our services can, and does, take place across agencies, networks and geographic regions simultaneously. Further, we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services. Our over-arching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients.

The various components of our business and material factors that affected us in


are discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or MD&A, of this report. None of our acquisitions or dispositions in the three year period ended

December 31, 2012

was material to our financial position or results of operations. For information concerning our acquisitions, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

Geographic Regions and Segments:

Our revenue is almost evenly divided between our United States and international operations. For financial information concerning our domestic and international operations and segment reporting, see our MD&A and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our Clients:

Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, our agencies serve similar clients, in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients, across a variety of geographic regions and locations. Our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy. Furthermore, in many cases, our agencies or networks serve different brand and/or product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks. For example, in


, our largest client was served by more than 150 of our agencies and represented

2.6%

of our


revenue. No other client accounted for more than

2.6%

of our


revenue. Our top 100 clients, ranked by revenue, were each served, on average, by more than 50 of our agencies in


and collectively represented approximately 52% of our


revenue.

Our Employees:

At

December 31, 2012

, we employed approximately

71,100

people. We are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements. The skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline is similar. Common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience. Recognizing the importance of this core competency, we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency. See our MD&A for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations.

Executive Officers of the Registrant:

Our executive officers as of

February 1, 2013

were:

Each executive officer has held his present position for at least five years.

Additional information about our directors and executive officers will appear under the captions “Corporate Governance,” “Transactions with Related Persons,” “Election of Directors,” “Executive Compensation” and “Stock Ownership” in our definitive proxy statement, which is expected to be filed with the SEC by

April 11, 2013

.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position.

Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. In particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. In 2012, the United States experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of Asia and Latin America continued to expand. However, the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the Euro Zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our Euro Zone markets. If economic conditions in these markets do not improve, the demand for our services could be further reduced. If domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.


In a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase.

In the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. Many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. Further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. In addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. We usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. We manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. However, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. The risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

A reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. Consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

The markets we operate in are highly competitive. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

The success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.

Our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

Our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Approximately 52% of our 2012 revenue came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position.

Our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. It is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. A significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.


We rely extensively on information technology systems.

We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. While we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business.

Government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. Any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. Such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. These actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. The operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. The risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, do not affect domestic-focused firms. These risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. For financial information on our operations by geographic region, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

We are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries.

We conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. Some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include: slower payment of invoices; social, political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and frequently changed. If we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.

Turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. If that were to occur, we may require additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.


Holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase approximately $660 million of notes, in whole or in part, on specific dates in the future.

On

June 15, 2013

,

$406.6 million

of our Convertible Notes due

July 1, 2038

, or the 2038 Notes,

may be put back to us for repurchase and on

July 31, 2013

,

$252.7 million

of our Convertible Notes due

July 31, 2032

, or the 2032 Notes,

may be put back to us for repurchase. If our convertible notes are put back to us, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases. We also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our

$2.5 billion

Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase. However, in the event that availability under our Credit Agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we may need to seek additional funding. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if at all.

Downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us.

Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, or S&P, rates our long-term debt

BBB+

and Moody’s Investors Service, or Moody's, rates our long-term debt

Baa1

. Our short-term debt ratings are

A2

and

P2

by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and Credit Agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. However, the interest rates and fees on our Credit Agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. Additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. Furthermore, the


Notes and


Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at specified ratios if, in the case of the


Notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to BBB or lower by S&P, or Baa3 or lower by Moody’s or in the case of the


Notes to BBB- or lower by S&P, and Ba1 or lower by Moody’s. These events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes.

We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.

We regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

Our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.

Generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions; but, our businesses could be in the future. However, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. At this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Summary

We are a strategic holding company. We provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines: advertising, customer relationship management, or CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. The fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements. We continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client-centric approach, as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base.

As a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications company, we operate in all major markets around the world. We have a large and diverse client base. Our largest client accounted for

2.6%

of our


revenue and no other client accounted for more than

2.6%

of our


revenue. Our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 52% of our


revenue. Our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than

14%

of our


revenue. Although our revenue is generally balanced between the United States and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns.

In


, our revenue increased

2.5%

compared to


. The increase reflects strong operating performance by many of our agencies, partially offset by the negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Increased revenue in the United States and continued growth in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America was partially offset by the on-going economic weakness in the Euro Zone.

Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. In particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. In


, the United States experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of Asia and Latin America continued to expand. However, the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the Euro Zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our Euro Zone markets. If economic conditions in these markets do not improve, the demand for our services could be further reduced. If domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.

Certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry. These trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non-traditional marketing channels, as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms. Additionally, in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets, clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers. We believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us.

In the near term, barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange, as a result of continued strong operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our


revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal GDP growth in our major markets. We expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities that will build on the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms, expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today.

Effective February 1, 2011, we acquired a controlling interest in the Clemenger Group, our affiliate in Australia and New Zealand increasing our equity ownership to 73.7% from 46.7%. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a non-cash gain of $123.4 million in the first quarter of 2011 resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value. This acquisition has and will continue to help us to further develop our combined businesses throughout the Asia Pacific region and further enhance our global capabilities.

We had an objective of improving EBITA margins to 2007 levels for the full year 2012. In connection with this objective, during 2011 we reviewed our businesses with a focus on enhancing our strategic position, improving our operations and


rebalancing our workforce. As part of this process, we disposed of certain non-core and underperforming businesses and repositioned others. As a result of these actions, we incurred charges of $131.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 for severance, real estate lease terminations and asset and goodwill write-offs related to disposals and other costs. We continue to perform reviews of our businesses and we will take actions, where appropriate, to reposition underperforming businesses. We will also continue to pursue operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions.

Given our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses. We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including growth by major geographic region, growth by major marketing discipline, impact from foreign currency fluctuations, growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients. In recent years, our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations.

We measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories: salary and service costs and office and general expenses. Salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs. Office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs, technology costs, depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses. Each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines. At the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience. The facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines, and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software. Because we are a service business, we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue.

Salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue. Salary and service costs increased

In the fourth quarter of 2012, income tax expense was reduced by $53 million, primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the Asia Pacific region, as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions. In an effort to support our continued expansion and pu

r

sue operational efficiencies in the Asia Pacific region, we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region. As a result of the reorganization, our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. Therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to. In future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately $11 million. The reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately $16 million resulting from U.S. state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined, based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in Egypt, that there was an other-than-temporary decline in its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a

$29.2 million

impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value. The impairment charge is included in income (loss) from equity method investments in our income statement.

Critical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Policies

The following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this MD&A. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes, including Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below.

Estimates:

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our cost-method investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Acquisitions and Goodwill:

We have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. In making acquisitions, the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, competitive position, geographic coverage and service offerings of the target businesses, as well as our experience and judgment.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. In circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100% of an entity is acquired, we record 100% of the goodwill acquired. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations (earn-outs). Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date. In


, we completed


acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest. Goodwill from these transactions was

$235.1 million

. In addition, for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2009, we made contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs) of

$40.4 million

, which were included in goodwill. Contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2009 are accrued, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain. At

December 31, 2012

, the amount we could be required to pay for earn-outs for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2009 is

$15.7 million

.

Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and/or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, as is typical in most service businesses, a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the know-how of the people, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately. For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In valuing these identified intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our five agency networks. The regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client-centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

, and the guidance set forth in FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics. The main economic components of each agency are


employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead expenses. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy.

Goodwill Impairment Review - Estimates and Assumptions:

We use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach, which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions.

In applying the income approach, we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows (“DCF”) for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin, EBITDA, tax rates, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long-term cash flow growth rates. All of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses, economic conditions related to the industry we operate in, as well as conditions in the global economy. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a DCF methodology are: (1) the expected long-term growth rate of our reporting units' cash flows and (2) the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).

The range of assumptions used for the long-term growth rate and WACC in our evaluations as of

June 30, 2012

and


were:

Long-term growth rate represents our estimate of the long-term growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in. The average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was approximately

7.5%

and the Average Nominal

GDP growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was 4.3% over the same period. We considered this history when determining the long-term growth rates used in our annual impairment test at

June 30, 2012

. We believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to GDP. We also believe, based on our historical performance, that our long-term growth rate will exceed Average Nominal GDP growth in the markets we operate in. For our annual test as of

June 30, 2012

, we used an estimated long-term growth rate of 4% for our reporting units.

When performing our annual impairment test as of

June 30, 2012

and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units, we considered the current macroeconomic environment, as well as industry and market specific conditions at mid-year 2012. In the first half of 2012, we experienced an increase in our revenue of 5.1%, which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. However, the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the Euro Zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our Euro Zone markets. We considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test. As a result, we estimated growth rates for the next six years that reflect a reduction from current business results.

The risk-adjusted discount rate used in our DCF analysis represents the estimated after-tax WACC for each of our reporting units and ranged from

10.3%

to

10.9%

. The WACC is comprised of (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market, (3) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and (4) a current after-tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt. The decrease in the WACC at

June 30, 2012

compared to June 30, 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in the long-term U.S. Treasury bond, the risk-free rate of return used as a component that we use in

determining the WACC.

Our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them. These differences drive  variations in fair value among our reporting units. In addition, these differences as well as differences in book value, including goodwill, cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units. The reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of Omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded. The remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result, they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt.


Goodwill Impairment Review - Conclusion:

Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Although not required, we performed Step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Based on the results of our impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at

June 30, 2012

, because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value. The minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 70%. Notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our WACC and long-term growth rate are reasonable, we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units. The results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of

June 30, 2012

revealed that if  WACC increased by 1% and/or long-term growth rate decreased by 1%, the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass Step 1 of the impairment test.

We will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment. The estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations, but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but they are subject to change from period to period. Actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material. A change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail Step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non-cash impairment charge and may have

an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at

June 30, 2012

, there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment. At December 31, 2012, given the current economic climate we reviewed the assumptions used in our June 30, 2012 annual impairment test for revenue growth, cash flows, WACC and long-term growth rate. Our actual 2012 results for revenue growth and cash flows approximated the forecast for revenue growth and cash flows that we used in our impairment test at June 30, 2012. Our assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for 2013 approximate our current 2013 forecast. We also reviewed the assumptions used for WACC and long-term growth rate. Using data at December 31, 2012, the assumptions are within the 1% change used in our sensitivity analysis at June 30, 2012. Based on these factors, we did not perform an interim evaluation for impairment on the carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2012. Additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in Notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and applicable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis. Revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement, upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured. Prior to recognizing revenue, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist, the sales price must be fixed or determinable and delivery, performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement. These principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines: advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements. Because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways, all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines.

In the majority of our businesses, we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned. Although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities, the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf. In these cases, costs incurred with third-party suppliers are excluded from our revenue. In certain arrangements, we act as principal and we contract directly with third-party suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment. In these circumstances, revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services.

Some of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals. We recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved, or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients.

Additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.


Share-Based Compensation:

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life, rate of risk free interest, volatility and dividend yield. If different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value, our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

Share-based compensation expense was

$80.8 million

$74.5 million

Results of Operations -


Compared to


(In millions):

EBITA, which we define as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets, and EBITA Margin, which we define as EBITA divided by Revenue, are Non-GAAP measures. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. The table above reconciles EBITA and EBITA Margin to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of Operating Income for the periods presented. We believe that EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

The components of


revenue change in the United States (“Domestic”) and the remainder of the world (“International”) were (in millions):

The components and percentages are calculated as follows:

•

The foreign exchange impact is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue (in this case

$14,529.4 million

for the Total column in the table). The foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency (

$14,219.4 million

less

$14,529.4 million

for the Total column in the table).

•

The acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses, less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the period.

•

Organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth.

•

The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component (

$13,872.5 million

for the Total column in the table).

Driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities, we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services through various client-centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives. These services include advertising, brand consultancy, corporate social responsibility consulting, crisis communications, custom publishing, data analytics, database management, direct marketing, entertainment marketing, environmental design, experiential marketing, field marketing, financial/corporate business-to-business advertising, interactive marketing, marketing research, media planning and buying, mobile marketing, multi-cultural marketing, non-profit marketing, public affairs, public relations, recruitment communications, reputation consulting, retail


marketing, search engine marketing, social media marketing and sports and event marketing. In an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories: advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications.

As a result of the reorganization, our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. Therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to. In future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately $11 million. The reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately $16 million resulting from U.S. state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit. We expect our effective tax rate for 2013 to approximate 33.6%.

Income tax expense for


reflects a number of items that were recorded in the first quarter of 2011. These items include a $39.5 million tax benefit related to charges incurred in connection with our repositioning actions, a provision of $2.8 million related to the remeasurement gain and a provision of $9.0 million for agreed upon adjustments to income tax returns that were under examination in 2011. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate for 2011 would have been 34.3%.

Income (Loss) From Equity Method Investments:

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined, based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in Egypt, that there was an other-than-temporary decline in its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a

$29.2 million

impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value. Excluding the impairment charge, income from equity method investments decreased $3.0 million to $14.2 million in

EBITA, which we define as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets, and EBITA Margin, which we define as EBITA divided by Revenue, are Non-GAAP measures. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. The table above reconciles EBITA and EBITA Margin to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of Operating Income for the periods presented. We believe that EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

.

The components of


revenue change in the United States (“Domestic”) and the remainder of the world (“International”) were (in millions):


The components and percentages are calculated as follows:

•

The foreign exchange impact is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue (in this case

$13,549.1 million

for the Total column in the table). The foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency (

$13,872.5 million

less

$13,549.1 million

for the Total column in the table).

•

The acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses, less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.

•

Organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth.

•

The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component (

$12,542.5 million

for the Total column in the table).

Repositioning Actions and Remeasurement Gain:

In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded

$131.3 million

of charges related to our repositioning actions. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded a

$123.4 million

remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in the Clemenger Group, our affiliate in Australia and New Zealand.

The impact on operating expenses of these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 was (in millions):

Operating Expenses:

Salary and services costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue. Salary and service costs increased

11.2%

in


compared to


. This increase reflects growth in our business, as well as increased compensation costs, including freelance labor and incentive compensation and an increase in severance of approximately $100 million to $201 million, including our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in salary and service costs was partially offset by the associated cost savings from these head count reductions.

Office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs. Office and general expenses increased

4.4%

in


compared to


, reflecting a decrease of $123.4 million related to the non-cash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the Clemenger Group in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by $38.5 million of charges related to our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the net decrease of $84.9 million related to the remeasurement gain and the charges for our repositioning actions, office and general expenses were

$2,035.7 million

in


, an increase of

9.0%

As a result of the above changes, operating margins increased to

Net Interest Expense:

Net interest expense increased to

in


, as compared to

$109.8 million

in


. Interest expense increased

$23.4 million

to

$158.1 million

. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 4.45% Senior Notes due 2020 in August 2010, partially offset by a net reduction in interest expense resulting from the interest rate swaps on our 2016 Notes entered into in August 2010. The interest rate swaps were settled with the counterparties in August 2011 resulting in a deferred gain of $33.2 million that is being amortized over the remaining life of the 2016 Notes as a reduction of interest expense. Interest income increased

$11.1 million

to

$36.0 million

in


. This increase in interest income was attributable to higher foreign cash balances available for investment.

Income Taxes:

Our effective tax rate for


decreased to

32.7%

, compared to

34.1%

in


. The decrease in the effective tax rate was caused by the following items recorded in the first quarter of 2011 (in millions):

The tax benefit on the repositioning actions was calculated based on the jurisdictions where the charges were incurred and reflects the likelihood that we will be unable to obtain a tax benefit for all charges incurred. The remeasurement gain resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in Clemenger created a difference between the book basis and tax basis of our investment. Because this basis difference is not expected to reverse, no deferred taxes were provided and the tax provision recorded represents the incremental U.S. tax on acquired historical unremitted earnings. The

$9.0 million

charge resulted from adjustments to U.S. income tax returns for calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007, that were agreed upon and recorded in the first quarter of 2011. The examination of those returns is closed.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Sources and Requirements, Including Contractual Obligations

Historically, the majority of our non-discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand. Working capital is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes, our recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations, as well as contingent purchase price obligations (earn-outs) related to acquisitions made in prior years.

Our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments, capital expenditures, payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. In December 2012, we paid the fourth quarter dividend on our common stock that historically has been paid in January of the following year. Our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand. In addition, depending on the level of our discretionary activity and conditions in the capital markets, we may use other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper, borrowing under our Credit Agreement or other long-term borrowings to finance these activities. We expect that we should be able to fund both our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for 2013 without incurring additional long-term debt. However, we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist. To take advantage of historically low borrowing rates, in April 2012, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes at an issue price of 99.567%. In August 2012, we issued an additional $500 million of our 2022 Notes at an issue price of 105.287% reflecting a yield to maturity of 2.99%. As a result of these issuances, we were able to reduce our total commercial paper issuances in


by 39% compared to


, as well as increase our cash balances from

December 31, 2011

.


We have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation, income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations. This typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year.

At

December 31, 2012

, our cash and cash equivalents

increased

by

$897.1 million

from

December 31, 2011

. The components of the increase for


are (in millions):

Principal Cash Sources and Principal Cash Uses amounts are Non-GAAP financial measures. These amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes. This presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding the primary sources and primary uses of our cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements.

Cash Management

We manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia. The treasury centers are managed by our wholly-owned finance subsidiaries. Each day, operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center. The treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit, the Credit Agreement or issue up to a total of $1.5 billion of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper. This process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively, as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes. In countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis, we arrange for local currency uncommitted lines of credit.

Our cash and cash equivalents

increased

$897.1 million

and our short-term investments

decreased

$3.2 million

from

December 31, 2011

. Short-term investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle, generally one year.


At

December 31, 2012

, our foreign subsidiaries held

$2,021.1 million

of our total cash and cash equivalents of

$2,678.3 million

. The majority of this cash is available to us, net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the United States. Changes in international tax rules or changes in U.S. tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

We have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. In countries where we conduct treasury operations, generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to our Credit Agreement. These financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings. We have deposit limits for each of these institutions. In countries where we do not conduct treasury operations, we ensure that all cash is held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards.

Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments

increased

$893.9 million

from the prior year end, partially reflecting the issuance of $1.25 billion of our 2022 Notes. As a result, our net debt position, which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, increased

$368.3 million

as compared to the prior year-end, as follows (in millions):

Net Debt is a Non-GAAP financial measure. This presentation, together with the comparable U.S. GAAP measures, reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

Debt Instruments and Related Covenants

We have committed and uncommitted lines of credit. We have a

$2.5 billion

committed line of credit, or Credit Agreement, with a consortium of banks expiring on

October 12, 2016

. We have the ability to classify borrowings under the Credit Agreement as long-term. The Credit Agreement provides support for up to

$1.5 billion

of commercial paper issuances, as well as back-up liquidity in the event that any of our convertible notes are put back to us.

Depending on market conditions at the time, we typically fund our day-to-day liquidity by issuing commercial paper, borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our Credit Agreement. At

December 31, 2012

, there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Commercial paper activity for the three years ended

December 31, 2012

was (dollars in millions):


The reduction in commercial paper borrowings in


as compared to


is a result of the issuance of our 2022 Notes.

At

December 31, 2012

, short-term borrowings of

$6.4 million

represent bank overdrafts and lines of credit of our international subsidiaries. These bank overdrafts and lines of credit are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities.

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement. These financial covenants limit the Leverage Ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated EBITDA to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12-month period (under the Credit Agreement, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). We are also required to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12-month period.

At December 31, 2012 we were in compliance with these covenants, as our Leverage Ratio was 2.1 times and our Interest Coverage Ratio was 11.6 times.

The Credit Agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends.

S&P rates our long-term debt BBB+ and Moody’s rates our long-term debt Baa1. Our short-term debt credit ratings are A2 and P2 by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016, 6.25% Senior Notes due July 15, 2019, 4.45% Senior Notes due August 15, 2020 and 3.625% Senior Notes due May 1, 2022, collectively the Senior Notes, convertible notes and Credit Agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded. However, the interest rates and fees on the Credit Agreement will increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are lowered.

Omnicom Capital Inc., or OCI, our wholly-owned finance subsidiary, together with us, is a co-obligor under our Senior Notes and convertible notes. Our Senior Notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us and OCI and we unconditionally guarantee OCI's obligations with respect to the Senior Notes and the convertible notes. OCI provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries. OCI's assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of OCI or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. Our Senior Notes and convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.

At

December 31, 2012

, the carrying value of our debt and amounts available under the Credit Agreement were (in millions):

Credit Markets and Availability of Credit

We will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients. We believe that these actions, in addition to operating cash from and the availability of our Credit Agreement, are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending.

In funding our day-to-day liquidity, we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market. We expect to continue funding our day-to-day liquidity through the commercial paper market. However, prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads. During these periods of


disruption, we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our Credit Agreement to mitigate these conditions and to fund our day-to-day liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets.

On

$406.6 million

of our 2038 Notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on

July 31, 2013

,

$252.7 million

of our 2032 Notes may be put back to us for repurchase. If our convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase. Although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our Credit Agreement to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any repurchase.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

We enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business. The following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual obligations at

$252.7 million

of our 2032 Notes may be put back to us for repurchase. If these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date

$659.4 million

of convertible notes could be due in 2013. At

December 31, 2012

, we classified our convertible notes as long-term in our balance sheet because our Credit Agreement does not expire until October 2016 and it is our intention to fund any repurchase with the Credit Agreement.

Consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice, certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs). We use contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the post-acquisition transition period. Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations.

The unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was $

244.4 million

at

December 31, 2012

. In


, we contributed

$9.1 million

to our defined benefit pension plans and paid $

10.3 million

in benefits for our postemployment arrangements. We do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2013.


The liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid. We have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities.

In the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. Many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. Further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. In addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. We usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. We manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. However, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. We have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. However, the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes. We limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. For foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For interest rate exposure, derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt.

As a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors.

We evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis, or VaR. VaR is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at

December 31, 2012

was not material.

Because we use foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to U.S. Dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. The effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. For the most part, revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency. This minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations.

While our major non-U.S. currency markets are the European Monetary Union, or the EMU, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and Japan, our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies. As an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds.

In certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency. To manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we use forward foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2012

, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of

$181.5 million

mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities.


Also, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency. In these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts. At

December 31, 2012

, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of

$63.6 million

mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities.

By using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably.

Interest Rate Risk

From time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. In prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost. At

December 31, 2012

, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding.

On

June 15, 2013

,

$406.6 million

of our 2038 Notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on

July 31, 2013

,

$252.7 million

of our 2032 Notes may be put back to us for repurchase. As we have done on prior occasions, we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put their notes to us. If we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the put date, including the price of our common stock, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk.

If our convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase. Although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our Credit Agreement to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase. Additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. The extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing.

Even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our Leverage Ratio or our debt to capital ratio. If we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our Interest Coverage Ratio. However, the Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio are currently well within the covenant thresholds. If either our Leverage Ratio was to increase 40% or our Interest Coverage Ratio was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. Therefore, based on our current ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in the Interest Coverage Ratio and reduction in the Leverage Ratio would still place us comfortably above the covenant requirements.

Credit Risk

We provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business, we grant credit to qualified clients. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for

2.6%

of our


revenue and no other client accounted for more than

2.6%

of our


revenue. However, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change.

In the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. Many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. Further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. In addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. We usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. We manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. However, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. We have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. However, the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information of Omnicom Group Inc. ("Omnicom"). Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, Omnicom’s consolidated financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The financial statements have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Their report expresses the independent accountant’s judgment as to the fairness of management’s reported operating results, cash flows and financial position. This judgment is based on the procedures described in the second paragraph of their report.

Omnicom management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision of management and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and our agencies, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Omnicom Group Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2012

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2012

. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2012

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2012

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule on page S-1, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Omnicom Group Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Omnicom Group Inc.:

We have audited Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2012

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2012

, and our report dated

February 19, 2013

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

1.

Presentation of Financial Statements

The terms “Omnicom,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Omnicom Group Inc. and our subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

2.

Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and applicable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour, or equivalent basis. Revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement, upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured. Prior to recognizing revenue, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist, the sales price must be fixed or determinable and delivery, performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement. These principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines: advertising, customer relationship management, public relations and specialty communications. Certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based on performance in accordance with client arrangements. Because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways, all of the key elements of our revenue recognition policy apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines. Revenue is recorded net of sales, use and value added taxes.

In the majority of our businesses, we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned. Although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities, the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf. In these cases, costs incurred with third-party suppliers are excluded from our revenue. In certain arrangements, we act as principal and we contract directly with third-party suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment. In these circumstances, revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services.

Some of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals. We recognize performance incentives in revenue when specific quantitative goals are achieved, or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients.

Operating Expenses.

Operating expenses are comprised of salary and service costs and office and general expenses. Salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs. Office and general costs consist of rent and occupancy costs, technology costs, depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses.

Operating expenses for the three years ended

December 31, 2012

were (in millions):

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in banks and interest-bearing time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. We have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each financial institution.

Short-Term Investments.

Short-term investments primarily consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle, generally one year. Short-term investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

F-9

OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Work in Process.

Work in process consists of costs incurred on behalf of clients in providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, including media and production costs, and fees that have not yet been billed. Media and production costs are billed during the production process and fees are generally billed within the next 30 days.

Available-for-Sale Securities.

Investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. These investments are carried at fair value using quoted market prices and are included in other assets in our balance sheet. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The carrying value of the available-for-sale securities was

$3.9 million

and

$3.8 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from

seven

to

ten years

for furniture and

three

to

five years

for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Property under capital lease is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Equity Method Investments.

Investments in non-public companies in which we own less than a 50% equity interest and where we exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Our proportionate share of the net income (loss) of the equity method investments is included in our results of operations. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying value of our investment. The excess of the cost of our investment over our proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the investee at the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill and included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill in our equity method investments is not amortized. We periodically review these investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value. A variety of factors are considered when determining if a decline in carrying value is other-than-temporary, including, among others, the financial condition and prospects of the investee, as well as our investment intent.

Cost Method Investments.

Investments in non-public companies in which we own less than a 20% equity interest and where we do not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. We periodically review these investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below carrying value. A variety of factors are considered when determining if a decline in fair value below carrying value is other-than-temporary, including, among others, the financial condition and prospects of the investee, as well as our investment intent. Cost method investments are carried at cost, which approximates or is less than fair value and are included in other assets in our balance sheet. The carrying value of our cost method investments was

$23.1 million

and

$23.6 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is periodically tested for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from

five

to

ten years

. We consider a number of factors in determining the useful lives and amortization method, including the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, as well as trade name recognition and customer attrition and no residual value is estimated for these assets.

We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually as of the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. There is a two-step test for goodwill impairment. In Step 1, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is equal to or greater than its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, then Step 2 of the impairment test is performed in order to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of that goodwill. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge recorded in results of operations in the period the impairment is identified.

We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our five networks. The regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client-centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

, and the guidance set forth in FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers,

F-10

OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead costs. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy. We use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions.

Based on the results of our annual impairment review, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, because the fair value of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book value. At December 31, 2012, given the current economic climate we reviewed the assumptions used in our June 30, 2012 annual impairment test for revenue growth, cash flows, WACC and long-term growth rate. Our actual 2012 results for revenue growth and cash flows approximated the forecast for revenue growth and cash flows that we used in our impairment test at June 30, 2012. Our assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for 2013 approximate our current 2013 forecast. We also reviewed the assumptions used for WACC and long-term growth rate. Using data at December 31, 2012, the assumptions are within the 1% change used in our sensitivity analysis at June 30, 2012. Based on these factors, we did not perform an interim evaluation for impairment on the carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2012.

Temporary Equity - Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests.

Owners of noncontrolling equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional equity interests at fair value as defined in the applicable agreements. The intent of the parties is to approximate fair value at the time of redemption by using a multiple of earnings that is consistent with generally accepted valuation practices used by market participants in our industry. These contingent redemption rights are embedded in the equity security at issuance, are not free-standing instruments, do not represent a de facto financing and are not under our control.

Treasury Stock.

Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for at cost. Reissued treasury shares, primarily in connection with share-based compensation plans, are accounted for at average cost. Gains or losses on reissued treasury shares are accounted for as additional paid-in capital and do not affect our results of operations.

Business Combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly, the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. In circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100% of an entity is acquired, we record 100% of the goodwill acquired. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred. Certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs). Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value using discount rates in affect at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations. Generally, there is no cap on the amount that can be earned under the contingent purchase price arrangements and payments are not contingent upon future employment. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date.

Subsidiary and Equity Investment Stock Transactions.

Transactions involving the purchase, sale or issuance of stock of a subsidiary where control is maintained are recorded as an increase or decrease in additional paid-in capital. Gains and losses from transactions involving subsidiary stock where control is lost are recorded in results of operations. Gains and losses from transactions involving stock of an equity investee are recorded in results of operations until control is achieved. In circumstances where the purchase of shares of an equity investee results in obtaining control, the existing carrying value of the investment is remeasured to the acquisition date fair value and any gain or loss is recognized in results of operations.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions.

Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The impact of the translation adjustments is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Net foreign currency transaction gains/(losses) recorded in results of operations were

$(2.7) million

,

$3.5 million

and

$3.8 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation.

Share-based compensation, arising from awards of stock options and restricted stock, is measured at the grant date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined and fixed on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock. The fair value of the restricted stock awards is charged to additional paid-in capital and is amortized to expense over the restriction period. For awards that have a service only vesting condition, we recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. For awards with a performance vesting condition, we recognize share-based compensation expense on a graded-vesting basis. See Note 10 for additional information regarding our specific award plans and estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our share-based compensation awards.

OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Salary Continuation Agreements.

Arrangements with certain present and former employees provide for continuing payments for periods up to ten years after cessation of full-time employment in consideration for agreement by the employees not to compete with us and to render consulting services during the postemployment period. Such payments are subject to certain limitations, including our operating performance during the postemployment period, represent the fair value of the services rendered and are expensed in such periods.

Severance

. The liability for one-time termination benefits, such as severance pay or benefit payouts, is measured and recognized at fair value in the period the liability was incurred. Subsequent changes to the liability are recognized in results of operations in the period of change.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Postemployment Arrangements

. The funded status of our defined benefit plans is recorded in our balance sheet. Funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. The benefit obligation for the defined benefit plans is the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value. Overfunded plans where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the benefit obligation are aggregated and recorded as a prepaid pension asset equal to the excess. Underfunded plans where the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets are aggregated and recorded as a liability equal to the excess. The liability for our postemployment arrangements is recorded in our balance sheet. The benefit obligation of our postemployment arrangements is the PBO and these arrangements are not funded. The current portion of the benefit obligation for our defined benefit plans and postemployment arrangements represents the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months that exceed the fair value of plan assets. This obligation is recorded in other current liabilities in our balance sheet.

Deferred Compensation

. Certain subsidiaries have individual deferred compensation arrangements with certain executives that provide for payments over varying terms upon retirement, cessation of employment or death. The cost of these arrangements is accrued during the employee’s service period.

Income Taxes.

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current period. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary difference between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets result principally from recording certain expenses in the financial statements which are not currently deductible for tax purposes, such as share-based compensation expense, tax loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities recorded in connection with acquisitions. Deferred tax liabilities result principally from expenses arising from financial instruments which are currently deductible for tax purposes but have not been expensed in the financial statements, basis differences arising from deductible goodwill and intangible assets and tax rate differentials on unremitted foreign earnings. Valuation allowances are recorded where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.

We have not provided U.S. federal and state income taxes on cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested. We have provided U.S. income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that have not been indefinitely reinvested. Interest and penalties related to tax positions taken in our tax returns are recorded in income tax expense.

Net Income Per Common Share.

Net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus, if dilutive, common share equivalents which include outstanding stock options and restricted stock.

Net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing net income per common share when a company's capital structure includes common stock and participating securities. Our unvested restricted stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends at the same rate as our common stock and therefore are considered participating securities. Under two-class method, basic and diluted net income per common share is reduced for a presumed hypothetical distribution of earnings to holders of our unvested restricted stock.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

We provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for

2.6%

of our


revenue and no other client accounted for more than

2.6%

of our


revenue.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Derivative Financial Instruments.

All derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or liability. Derivatives qualify for hedge accounting if: (1) the hedging instrument is designated as a hedge at inception, (2) the hedged exposure is specifically identifiable and exposes us to risk and (3) a change in fair value of the derivative financial instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the hedged exposure will have a high degree of correlation. The method of assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness is formally documented at hedge inception. Hedge effectiveness is assessed and hedge ineffectiveness is measured at least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative used as hedge is recognized in results of operations.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Fair Value.

We apply the fair value measurement guidance of FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, for our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value and for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The measurement of fair value requires the use of techniques based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

•

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations where inputs are observable or where significant value drivers are observable.

•

Level 3 - Instruments where significant value drivers are unobservable to third parties.

When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of our financial instruments and classify such items in Level 1. In some cases, we use quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets and model-derived valuations. These items are classified in Level 2.

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we consider certain market valuation adjustments that market participants would consider in determining fair value, including: counterparty credit risk adjustments applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of the counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market and credit risk adjustments applied to reflect our own credit risk when valuing liabilities measured at fair value.

Reclassifications.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we reclassified unbilled costs primarily comprised of media and production costs, as well as fees that are generally billed within the next 30 days to work in process from other current assets in our balance sheet. This change had no affect on our prior reported total current assets, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that this change reflects the liquidity hierarchy of these items and aligns them with our internal working capital management reporting.

Business Combinations

In


, we completed


acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in companies in which we had an existing minority ownership interest. Goodwill from these transactions was

$235.1 million

. In addition, for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2009, we made contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs) of

$40.4 million

, which were included in goodwill. Approximately

$45.9 million

of the goodwill recorded in connection with the


acquisitions is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We also acquired additional equity in certain of our majority owned subsidiaries. These transactions are accounted for as equity transactions and no additional goodwill was recorded. None of our acquisitions in


were material to our results of operations or financial position.

Our valuation of the acquired businesses is based on a number of factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position and service offerings, as well as our experience and judgment. Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms, including the expansion of their geographic area and/or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice, certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs). We use contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the post-acquisition transition period. Contingent purchase price payments for these transactions, as well as certain acquisitions completed in prior years, are derived using the performance of the acquired entity and are based on predetermined formulas. The liability for contingent purchase price obligations was

$266.2 million

and

$142.6 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, of which

$83.2 million

and

$32.8 million

, respectively, is included in other current liabilities in our balance sheet.

For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets. We use several market participant measurements to determine fair value. This approach includes consideration of similar and recent transactions, as well as utilizing discounted expected cash flow methodologies and when available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to supplement our analysis. As is typical for most service businesses, a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the specialized know-how of the workforce, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In executing our acquisition strategy, one of the primary drivers in identifying and executing a specific transaction is the existence of, or the ability to, expand our existing client relationships. The expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions.

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement. These financial covenants limit the Leverage Ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated EBITDA to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12-month period (under the Credit Agreement, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). We are also required to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12-month period.

At December 31, 2012 we were in compliance with these covenants, as our Leverage Ratio was 2.1 times and our Interest Coverage Ratio was 11.6 times.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Convertible Notes due July 31, 2032 (“2032 Notes”), of which

$647.3 million

of the notes have been repurchased and retired. At

December 31, 2012

, the 2032 Notes were potentially convertible into

4.6 million

shares of our common stock, implying a conversion price of

$55.01

per share, subject to normal anti-dilution adjustments. The 2032 Notes are convertible at the specified ratio only upon the occurrence of certain events, including: if our common stock trades above certain levels, if we effect extraordinary transactions or if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded from their

December 31, 2012

level to BBB or lower by Standard & Poor's Rating Service ("S&P"), or to Baa3 or lower by Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody's"). These events would not result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion.

Holders of the 2032 Notes have the right to put the notes back to us for cash on July 31 of each year and we have the right to redeem the notes for cash on July 31, 2013 and 2014. After July 31, 2014, we can redeem the 2032 Notes at any time. There are no events that accelerate the noteholders’ put rights.

If the market price of our common stock exceeds certain thresholds during any six month period February 1 to July 31 and August 1 to January 31, we may be required to pay contingent cash interest. At

$600 million

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Convertible Notes due

June 15, 2033

(“2033 Notes”), of which

$193.3 million

of the notes have been repurchased and retired.

In June 2006 substantially all of the 2033 Notes then outstanding were amended to extend the maturity of the notes from June 15, 2033 to July 1, 2038. The amended notes are referred to as our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Convertible Notes due 2038 (“2038 Notes”).

At

December 31, 2012

, the 2038 Notes were potentially convertible into

7.9 million

shares of our common stock, implying a conversion price of

The 2038 Notes are convertible at the specified ratio only upon the occurrence of certain events, including: if our common stock trades above certain levels, if we effect extraordinary transactions or if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded from their

December 31, 2012

level to BBB- or lower by S&P or Ba1 or lower by Moody’s. The occurrence of these events will not result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion.

Holders of the 2038 Notes have the right to put the notes back to us for cash on June 15, 2013, 2018 and 2023 and on each June 15 annually thereafter through June 15, 2037 and we have a right to redeem the notes for cash on June 17, 2013 and June 15, 2018. After June 15, 2018, we can redeem the 2038 Notes at any time. There are no events that accelerate the noteholders’ put rights.

Beginning in June 2010, if the market price of our common stock exceeds certain thresholds during any six month period June 16 to December 15 and December 16 to June 15, we may be required to pay contingent cash interest.

In June 2010, the 2038 Notes were amended whereby substantially all of the holders of the 2038 Notes then outstanding agreed to waive their right to contingent cash interest, if payable, from December 15, 2010 through and including December 15, 2013.

In the event the holders of our 2032 Notes or 2038 Notes (collectively “Convertible Notes”) exercise their conversion right, the conversion obligation is equal to a conversion value determined on the day of conversion, calculated by multiplying the share price at the close of business on that day by the underlying number of shares into which the notes convert. We satisfy the conversion value by paying the initial principal amount of the note in cash and the balance of the conversion value in cash or shares, at our option. A put obligation can only be satisfied in cash.

Our Convertible Notes provide the noteholders with certain rights that we consider to be embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives could be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the underlying host instrument. The noteholders’ rights considered for bifurcation were: (1) an embedded conversion option to convert the bonds into shares of our common stock, (2) the right to put the Convertible Notes back to us for repurchase (noteholders' put right) and our agreement to not call the Convertible Notes except on certain specific dates (no call right) and (3) the right to collect contingent cash interest from us if certain criteria are met. As discussed below, the embedded derivatives were not required to be bifurcated or had no impact on the carrying value of the Convertible Notes and accordingly, the Convertible Notes are carried at their value due at maturity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The embedded conversion option qualified for the exception covering convertible debt in FASB ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

and we are not required to separately account for the embedded conversion option. The embedded conversion option met the criteria and would, if converted, be accounted for in equity as if it was a freestanding derivative. We are not required to separately value and account for the noteholders’ put right and the no call right. These rights were considered to be clearly and closely related to the underlying Convertible Notes and are not contingently exercisable. Additionally, the debt was not issued with a substantial discount or premium. Lastly, the noteholders’ right to collect contingent cash interest is a derivative and is required to be marked to market value each reporting period with changes recorded in interest expense. The value of this right is primarily linked to the price of our common stock and not the debt host contract. Therefore, the right to collect contingent cash interest is not clearly and closely related to the Convertible Notes and is required to be accounted for separately.

In 2004, our convertible debt was amended to include a provision to satisfy the conversion value by paying the principal amount of the notes in cash and the balance of the conversion option in cash or shares at our option. In prior years, as required by U.S. GAAP, we separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the notes by allocating the proceeds at the date of amendment of the notes between the liability and equity components and recording

$47.5 million

,

$28.5 million

after tax, of interest expense related to the equity conversion option over the expected life of the conversion option. The convertible debt was issued at par (no discount or premium) and does not bear any interest. As a result, we concluded that absent any non-contractual supplemental interest payment the noteholders have no economic incentive to hold the notes past the contractual put dates. Therefore, the expected life of the conversion option was determined to be the period from amendment of the notes in 2004 to the first respective put date, or


year in the case of the 2032 Notes and

1.6

years in the case of the 2038 Notes. The amortization of the value of the conversion option was recorded as interest expense.

From time to time, we have made non-contractual supplemental interest payments to holders of our convertible debt who did not put their notes back to us for repurchase on the respective put dates or who agreed to amendments to the convertible notes. The supplemental interest payments are amortized to interest expense ratably over the period to the next put date. No supplemental interest payments were paid in

Segment Reporting

Our wholly and partially owned agencies operate within the advertising, marketing and corporate communications services industry. These agencies are organized into agency networks, virtual client networks, regional reporting units and operating groups. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, our agencies serve similar clients, in similar industries and, in many cases, the same clients across a variety of geographic regions. In addition, our agency networks have similar economic characteristics, including similar costs and long-term profit contribution. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs and other overhead expenses. Therefore, given these similarities, we aggregate our operating segments, which are our five agency networks, into one reporting segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined, based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in Egypt, that there was an other-than-temporary decline in its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a

$29.2 million

impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value. The measurement of fair value was based on significant unobservable estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs), including expected discounted cash flows. The estimates and assumptions included a weighted average cost of capital of

22%

and an expected long-term growth rate of

5%

. The impairment charge is included in income (loss) from equity method investments in our income statement.

Effective February 1, 2011, we acquired a controlling interest in the Clemenger Group, our affiliate in Australia and New Zealand, increasing our equity ownership to

73.7%

from

46.7%

. In connection with this transaction we recorded a remeasurement gain of

$123.4 million

in the first quarter of 2011. Additionally, in 2011, we acquired a controlling interest in affiliates in India and Turkey increasing our equity ownership to

100%

and

and

.

The differences between the fair value of our shares at the acquisition dates and the carrying value of the investments prior to the acquisitions resulted in the remeasurement gains. The purchase prices were negotiated at fair value in arms-length transactions. In addition, we performed a valuation of the businesses and confirmed the fair values used to determine the remeasurement gains. We used the following valuation methodologies to confirm the fair values: the income approach which utilized discounted expected future cash flows, comparative market participant multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and, when available, comparable transactions.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

Share-based incentive awards are provided to employees under our 2007 Incentive Award Plan (“2007 Plan”). The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee"). Awards under the 2007 Plan include stock options, restricted stock and other stock awards. The maximum number of shares of common stock that can be granted under the 2007 Plan is

17 million

shares plus any shares awarded under the 2007 Plan and any prior plan that were forfeited or expired. Stock option awards reduce the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All other awards reduce the number of shares available for grant by

2.5

shares for every one share of common stock awarded. The terms of each award and the exercise date are determined by the Compensation Committee. The 2007 Plan does not permit the holder of an award to elect cash settlement under any circumstances. At

If the actual tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset, the difference is recorded in additional paid-in capital (“APIC Pool”). If the actual tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset and no APIC Pool exists, the difference is recorded in results of operations.

Stock Options

The exercise price of stock option awards may not be less than 100% of the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the option term cannot exceed ten years from the grant date.

Typically, stock option awards vest 30% per year for the first two years and are fully vested three years from the grant date.

166,426

PRSUs to certain employees at a weighted average grant price of

$49.13

("2012 PRSUs").

Each PRSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock on vesting. The ultimate number of PRSUs received by the employee depends on the Company's average return on equity over a three year period compared to the average return on equity of a peer group of five principal competitors over the same period. The 2011 PRSUs vest over five years and the 2012 PRSUs vest over three years.

One half of the 2011 PRSUs have a service only vesting condition and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. The other half of the 2011 PRSUs and all the 2012 PRSUs have a service and performance vesting condition and compensation expense is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. Over the performance period, the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based on our estimate of the probability of achievement of the performance target for the portion of the awards subject to the performance vesting condition. In

The tax benefit on the repositioning actions was calculated based on the jurisdictions where the charges were incurred and reflects the likelihood that we will be unable to obtain a tax benefit for all charges incurred. The remeasurement gain resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in Clemenger created a difference between the book basis and tax basis of our investment. Because this basis difference is not expected to reverse, no deferred taxes were provided and the tax provision recorded represents the incremental U.S. tax on acquired historical unremitted earnings. The

$9.0 million

charge resulted from adjustments to U.S. income tax returns for calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007 that were agreed upon and recorded in the first quarter of 2011.

OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) provided an election where qualifying cancellation of indebtedness income for debt reacquired in 2009 and 2010 can be deferred and included in taxable income ratably over the five taxable years beginning in 2014 and ending in 2018. In 2009 and 2010, we reacquired and retired

$1,382.0 million

of our Convertible Debt resulting in a tax liability of approximately

$340 million

that is included in the deferred tax liability for financial instruments. Under the ARRA, we expect to pay this liability during the deferral period beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2018.

We have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in future periods because results of future operations are expected to generate sufficient taxable income. The valuation allowance of

$47.8 million

and

$24.9 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, relates to tax loss and credit carryforwards in the Unites States and international jurisdictions. Our tax loss and credit carryforwards are available to us for periods ranging from

5 to 20 years

, which is in excess of the forecasted utilization of such carryforwards. To the extent that future tax deductions for share-based compensation are less than the deferred tax assets resulting from recording book share-based compensation expense, we expect to have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits within the APIC Pool available to offset any potential future shortfalls.

We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately

$1.4 billion

of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these undistributed earnings in our international operations. Accordingly, we currently have no plans to repatriate these funds. As such, we do not know the time or manner in which we would repatriate these funds. Because the time or manner of repatriation is uncertain, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes, withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability. We have provided $

124.7 million

of U.S. taxes, which are included in deferred tax liabilities, on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$1.8 billion

that are not indefinitely reinvested. Changes in international tax rules or changes in U.S. tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits

Defined Contribution Plans

Our domestic and international subsidiaries provide retirement benefits for their employees primarily through defined contribution profit sharing and savings plans. Contributions to these plans vary by subsidiary and have generally been in amounts up to the maximum percentage of total eligible compensation of participating employees that is deductible for income tax purposes. Contribution expense was

$113.5 million

,

$102.1 million

and

$83.9 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Certain of our subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Two of our U.S. businesses and several of our non-U.S. businesses sponsor pension plans. These plans provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings. The U.S. plans cover approximately 1,200 participants, are closed to new participants and do not accrue future benefit credits. The non-U.S. plans cover approximately 6,900 participants, are not covered by ERISA and include plans required by local law.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition, we have a Senior Executive Restrictive Covenant and Retention Plan (“Retention Plan”) for certain executive officers of Omnicom selected to participate by the Compensation Committee. The Retention Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation severance plan that was adopted to secure non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and ongoing consulting services from such executive officers and to strengthen the retention aspect of executive officer compensation. The Retention Plan provides annual payments upon termination following at least seven years of service with Omnicom or its subsidiaries to the participants or to their beneficiaries. A participant’s annual benefit is payable for 15 consecutive calendar years following termination, but in no event prior to age 55. The annual benefit is equal to the lesser of (i) the participant’s final average pay times an applicable percentage, which is based upon the executive’s years of service as an executive officer, not to exceed 35% or (ii) $1.5 million, adjusted for cost-of-living not to exceed 2.5% per year. The Retention Plan is unfunded and benefits will be paid when due.

The components of net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended

net of tax, respectively, that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost. The unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in 2013 is

$4.6 million

.

The weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended

December 31, 2012

were:

The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets for our U.S. plans is based on several factors, including current and expected asset allocations, historical and expected returns on various asset classes and current and future market conditions. A total return investment approach using a mix of equities and fixed income investments maximizes the long-term return. This strategy is intended to minimize plan expense by achieving long-term returns in excess of the growth in plan liabilities over time. The discount rate used to compute net periodic benefit cost is based on yields of available high-quality bonds and reflects the expected cash flow as of the measurement date.

The expected returns on plan assets and discount rates for our non-U.S. plans are based on local factors, including each plan’s investment approach, local interest rates and plan participant profiles.

Experience gains and losses and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are generally amortized over a period no longer than the expected average future service of active employees.

Our funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements in accordance with the applicable employee benefit and tax laws that the plans are subject to, plus such additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate. We contributed

$9.1 million

,

$7.8 million

,

$7.5 million

Leases

We lease substantially all our office space under operating leases and certain equipment under operating and capital leases that expire at various dates. Office leases may provide for additional renewal periods at our option. In circumstances where the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease, the renewal period is included in the determination of the lease term. Office leases may include scheduled rent increases and concessions, such as rent abatements and landlord incentives and tenant improvement allowances. Scheduled rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Concessions are recorded as deferred rent and are amortized to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain office leases require payment of real estate taxes and other occupancy costs. These costs are not included in rent expense. Leasehold improvements made at inception or during the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the lease term, which may include renewal periods where the renewal is reasonably assured.

Temporary Equity - Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Owners of noncontrolling equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional equity interests at fair value as defined in the applicable agreements. Assuming that the subsidiaries perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels, at

December 31, 2012

, the aggregate estimated maximum amount we could be required to pay in future periods is

$198.4 million

, of which

$113.1 million

is currently exercisable by the holders. If these rights are exercised, there would be an increase in the net income attributable to Omnicom as a result of our increased ownership interest and the reduction of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The ultimate amount paid could be significantly different because the redemption amount is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses, the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

As a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes. We limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. For foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For interest rate exposure, derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt.

As a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors.

We evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis ("VaR"). VaR is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at

December 31, 2012

was not material.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Our regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia centralize and manage our cash. As an integral part of our treasury operations, we use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and the treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. In certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency. To manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we use forward foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2012

and


, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of

$181.5 million

and

$120.8 million

, respectively, mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities. Additionally, the treasury centers use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency. In these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts. At

December 31, 2012

and


, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of

$63.6 million

and

$71.6 million

, respectively, mitigating the foreign exchange risk related to these activities. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value of these instruments.

The terms of our forward contracts are generally less than 90 days.

The changes in the fair value of these contracts and of the underlying exposures generally offset and are included in our results of operations. By using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably.

Interest Rate Risk

From time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. In prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost. At

December 31, 2012

and


, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding.

New Accounting Standards

On January 1, 2012, FASB Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08,

Testing Goodwill for Impairment

became effective. This standard gives a company the option of either performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test or performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test is necessary. A company may choose to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units or may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to Step 1 of the impairment test. We performed our annual impairment test at the end of the second quarter (see Note 5).

F-34

On January 31, 2013, FASB issued FASB ASU No. 2013-01,

Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

("ASU 2013-01"). This standard requires enhanced disclosure about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in the statement of financial position or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement. ASU 2013-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2013 and all interim periods in that year and requires retrospective disclosure for all comparative periods. ASU 2013-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.

On January 31, 2013, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 11-A,

Parents Accounting for Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity

(“EITF 11-A”). Under EITF 11-A when: (1) a parent sells an investment in a foreign entity and ceases to have a controlling interest in that foreign entity or a foreign subsidiary disposes of substantially all of its assets or (2) control of a foreign entity is obtained in which it held an equity interest before the acquisition date, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income. EITF 11-A is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2014, but early adoption is permitted. However, we are not yet in a position to assess the impact on our results of operations or financial position on adoption of EITF 11-A.

On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

(“ASU 2013-02”). ASU 2013-02 requires disclosure either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety. For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2013. We will adopt ASU 2013-02 for the quarter ending March 31, 2013. ASU 2013-02 affects financial statement disclosure only and its adoption will not affect our results of operations or financial position.
