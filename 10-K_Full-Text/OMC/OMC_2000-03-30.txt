Clients

      The  clients  of  the  Omnicom  Group  include  major  consumer  products,
industrial,  financial  and  service  industry  companies,  as well as  smaller,
pan-regional, national and local companies.

      The Omnicom Group's ten largest clients accounted for approximately 19% of
1999 commissions and fees.  Twelve Omnicom Group agency brands provided services
to the Company's  largest client,  which accounted for  approximately  5% of the
1999 commissions and fees.

Commissions and Fees

      In  most  cases,  fees  are  generated  in lieu  of  commissions.  Several
different  fee  arrangements  are used  depending  on the client and  individual
agency. In general,  fee charges relate to the cost of providing services plus a
markup.

      Commissions  charged on media  billings are not uniform and are negotiated
with the  client.  In  accordance  with  industry  practice,  the  media  source
typically bills the agency for the time or space purchased and the Omnicom Group
companies bill their clients for this amount plus the commission.

      Revenues are dependent upon the marketing requirements of clients and tend
to be highest in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year.

Competitive Conditions

      The  Company's  business  is highly  competitive  and  accounts  may shift
agencies,  usually on 90 days' notice.  Clients may also reduce  advertising and
marketing budgets at any time. An agency's ability to compete for new clients is
affected in some instances by the policy,  which many  advertisers and marketers
follow,  of not permitting their agencies to represent  competitive  accounts in
the same market.  As a result,  increasing size may limit an agency's  potential
for securing certain new clients.  In the vast majority of cases,  however,  the
Omnicom Group's  consistent  maintenance of separate,  independent agency brands
have enabled the Company to represent competing clients.

      The Omnicom Group agency brands have sought,  and will seek,  new business
by showing potential clients examples of advertising and marketing campaigns and
by  explaining  the  variety of related  services  offered.  The  Omnicom  Group
competes  in the United  States and  internationally  with a  multitude  of full
service  and  special  service  agencies.  In addition to the usual risks of the
Company's business, international operations are subject to the risk of currency
exchange   fluctuations,   exchange  control  restrictions  and  to  actions  of
governmental authorities.

Employees

      The  business  success of the Omnicom  Group is, and will  continue to be,
highly dependent upon the skills and creativity of its creative, research, media
and account personnel and their relationships with clients. The Company believes
its agencies have established reputations for creativity and marketing expertise
which attract,  retain and stimulate  talented  personnel.  There is substantial
competition among advertising  agencies for talented  personnel and all agencies
are  vulnerable  to  adverse  consequences  from  the  loss of key  individuals.
Employees are generally not under  employment  contracts and are free to move to
competitors. The Company believes that its compensation arrangements for its key
employees,  which in  addition  to base  salaries  and  performance  bonuses may
include  stock  options,  restricted  stock and  retirement  plans,  are  highly
competitive with those of other advertising  agencies.  As of December 31, 1999,
the Omnicom Group, excluding unconsolidated  affiliates,  employed approximately
43,000 persons, of which approximately 17,700 were employed in the United States
and approximately 25,300 were employed in its international offices.

Government Regulation

      The Company's  business is subject to government  regulation,  both within
and outside the United States.  In the United States,  federal,  state and local
governments  and their  agencies and various  consumer  groups have  directly or
indirectly  affected  or  attempted  to affect the scope,  content and manner of
presentation  of  advertising.  The  continued  activity  by  government  and by
consumer  groups  regarding  advertising  may cause  further  change in domestic
advertising  practices  in the  coming  years.  While the  Company  is unable to




estimate the effect of these developments on its domestic  business,  management
believes the total volume of  advertising  in general media in the United States
will not be materially  reduced due to future  legislation or  regulation,  even
though the scope,  content  and manner of  presentation  of  advertising  may be
modified.  In addition,  the Company will continue to ensure that its management
and  operating  personnel  are  aware  of and  are  responsive  to the  possible
implications of such developments.

Item 2. Properties

      Substantially all of the Company's offices are located in leased premises.
The Company  actively  manages its lease  obligations  and,  where  appropriate,
consolidates its leased premises.  Management has obtained subleases for most of
the premises vacated. Where appropriate, management has established reserves for
the  difference  between the cost of the leased  premises  that were vacated and
anticipated sublease income.

Domestic

      The Company's  corporate office occupies  approximately  50,000 sq. ft. of
space at 437 Madison  Avenue,  New York,  New York under a lease expiring in the
year 2010.

      Offices in  Atlanta,  Boston,  Chicago,  Coral  Gables,  Dallas,  Detroit,
Houston,  Irvine,  Kansas City, Los Angeles,  Minneapolis,  New York, Palo Alto,
Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Stamford, St. Louis
and  Washington  D.C. and at various other  locations  occupy  approximately  an
aggregate  of 5,645,000  sq. ft. of space under  leases with varying  expiration
dates.

International

      The  Company's  international  subsidiaries  and  affiliates in Australia,
Austria,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Bulgaria,  Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech
Republic,  Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Hong  Kong,
Hungary,   India,  Ireland,   Italy,  Japan,  Latvia,   Malaysia,   Mexico,  the

Rico, Romania, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Results of Operations

      As  discussed  in  Note 2 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  on
February 10, 1999 the Company  completed the  acquisition of Abbott Mead Vickers
Group  Limited  (formerly  known as Abbott Mead  Vickers plc)  ("AMV").  The AMV
acquisition  was  accounted  for  under  the   pooling-of-interests   method  of
accounting.  Accordingly,  the Company's financial statements have been restated
to include the financial results of AMV for all periods presented. The following
discussion is made with respect to the restated financial statements.

      In 1999,  domestic  revenues  from  commissions  and fees  increased  20.7
percent.  The effect of acquisitions,  net of divestitures,  accounted for a 6.1
percent  increase.  The remaining 14.6 percent increase was due to the growth of
existing businesses,  including net new business wins and higher net spending by
existing clients.

      In 1998,  domestic  revenues  from  commissions  and fees  increased  29.8
percent. The effect of acquisitions,  net of divestitures,  accounted for a 12.5
percent  increase.  The remaining 17.3 percent increase was due to the growth of
existing businesses,  including net new business wins and higher net spending by
existing clients.

      In 1999,  international  revenues  increased  18.4 percent.  The effect of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  accounted  for a 10.9 percent  increase in
international revenues.  Changes in the translation of foreign currencies to the
U.S. dollar decreased  international revenues by 6.0 percent. The remaining 13.5
percent increase was due to the growth of existing businesses, including net new
business wins and higher net spending by existing clients.

      In 1998,  international  revenues  increased  30.6 percent.  The effect of
acquisitions,  net of  divestitures,  accounted for an 18.7 percent  increase in
international revenues.  Changes in the translation of foreign currencies to the
U.S. dollar decreased  international revenues by 2.5 percent. The remaining 14.4
percent increase was due to the growth of existing businesses, including net new
business wins and higher net spending by existing clients.

      In  1999,   worldwide   operating   expenses   increased   18.2   percent.
Acquisitions,  net of divestitures during the year,  accounted for a 7.3 percent
increase in worldwide operating expenses.  Changes in the translation of foreign
currencies to the U.S.  dollar  decreased  worldwide  operating  expenses by 2.8
percent.  The  remaining  13.7  percent  increase  was  caused by normal  salary
increases  and growth in  out-of-pocket  expenditures  to service the  increased
revenue  base.  Net foreign  exchange  transaction  gains did not  significantly
impact operating expenses for the year.

      In  1998,   worldwide   operating   expenses   increased   29.3   percent.
Acquisitions,  net of divestitures during the year, accounted for a 15.6 percent
increase in worldwide operating expenses.  Changes in the translation of foreign
currencies to the U.S.  dollar  decreased  worldwide  operating  expenses by 1.3
percent.  The  remaining  15.0  percent  increase  was  caused by normal  salary
increases  and growth in  out-of-pocket  expenditures  to service the  increased
revenue  base.  Net foreign  exchange  transaction  gains did not  significantly
impact operating expenses for the year.

      Net  interest  expense  in  1999  increased  $10  million.  This  increase
primarily reflects higher average borrowings during the year and higher interest
rates.




      Net  interest  expense in 1998  increased  $19.3  million.  This  increase
primarily reflects higher average borrowings during the year,  resulting in part
from the  issuance of the 2 1/4%  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  and the
5.20%  French  Franc  Notes,  partially  offset by the effect of higher  average
amounts of cash and marketable securities invested during the year.

      The 1999  effective  tax rate  decreased  to 40.6  percent.  The  decrease
reflects lower domestic and international effective tax rates.

      The  effective  tax rate for 1998  decreased  to 42.0  percent  from  42.6
percent  and  primarily  reflects  lower  effective  tax rates at the  Company's
international subsidiaries.

      In 1999, consolidated net income increased 30.1 percent. This increase was
primarily the result of revenue growth and margin improvement,  partially offset
by a decrease in equity in  affiliates  and an  increase  in  minority  interest
expense.  In addition,  in  connection  with the  restatement  of the prior year
amounts,  certain  costs  were  recorded  by AMV,  including  transaction  costs
associated  with the merger.  Operating  margin,  which  excludes  net  interest
expense,  increased to 14.1 percent in 1999 from 13.1 percent in 1998, primarily
as a result of greater  growth in  commission  and fee  revenue  compared to the
growth in operating  expenses.  Changes in the translation of foreign currencies
to the U.S.  dollar  decreased  consolidated  net  income  by 4.2  percent.  The
decrease  in  equity  in  affiliates  in 1999 was  primarily  the  result of the
acquisition of increased ownership interests in certain affiliates that resulted
in their consolidation in the December 31, 1999 financial statements, as well as
lower aggregate profits by companies  accounted for under the equity method. The
increase in minority interest expense in 1999 was caused by higher earnings from
companies in which  minority  interests  exists and an increase,  as a result of
acquisitions,  in the number of consolidated companies with a minority interest,
including the conversion of certain affiliates into subsidiaries.

      In 1998, consolidated net income increased 28.3 percent. This increase was
the result of  revenue  growth and  margin  improvement,  partially  offset by a
decrease in equity in affiliates and an increase in minority  interest  expense.
Operating margin, which excludes net interest expense, increased to 13.1 percent
in 1998 from 12.5  percent in 1997 as a result of greater  growth in  commission
and  fee  revenue  than  the  growth  in  operating  expenses.  Changes  in  the
translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased  consolidated net
income by 1.9 percent.  The decrease in equity in  affiliates  was primarily the
result of the acquisition of increased ownership interests in certain affiliates
that  resulted  in  their  consolidation  in the  December  31,  1998  financial
statements,  as well as lower aggregate profits by companies accounted for under
the equity  method.  The  increase  in minority  interest  expense was caused by
higher earnings from companies in which minority interests exist and an increase
as a result  of  acquisitions  during  the year in the  number  of  consolidated
companies  with  a  minority  interest,  including  the  conversion  of  certain
affiliates into subsidiaries.

      At December 31, 1999, accounts  receivable,  net of allowance for doubtful
accounts,  increased by $667.0  million from  December 31, 1998. At December 31,
1999, accounts payable increased by $746.9 million from December 31, 1998. These
increases were primarily due to an increased  volume of activity  resulting from
business  growth and  acquisitions  during the year and, for  accounts  payable,
differences  in the timing of payments to media and other  suppliers  in 1999 as
compared to 1998.

      The Company is subject to the risk of currency  exchange rate fluctuations
related to its international  operations.  This risk is generally limited to the
net income of the  operations as the revenues and expenses of the operations are
generally  denominated  in the same currency.  The Company or its  international
operations  may in some cases enter into  hedging  transactions  to minimize the
risk of  adverse  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  The  Company's  major
international markets are Brazil, Canada, the Euro currency countries, Japan and
the United Kingdom.

      As part of managing  the  Company's  exposures  to currency  exchange  and
market interest rates, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial
instruments.   Derivative  financial  instruments  are  subject  to  market  and
counterparty  risk. Market risk is the potential for loss resulting from changes
in market  conditions.  The Company  periodically  determines the potential loss
from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. Value-at-risk uses a
statistical  model that utilizes  historic  currency  exchange and interest rate
data to  measure  the  potential  impact on  future  earnings  of the  Company's
existing  portfolio  of  derivative  financial  instruments.  The  value-at-risk
analysis  performed on the Company's  December 31, 1999  portfolio of derivative
financial   instruments   indicated  that  the  risk  of  loss  was  immaterial.
Counterparty  risk  arises




from the  inability  of a  counterparty  to meet its  obligations.  To  minimize
counterparty risk, the Company only enters into derivative  contracts with major
well-known  financial  institutions  that have credit ratings equal to or better
than the Company's.

      The Company's derivative  activities are limited in volume and confined to
risk management  activities  related to the Company's  worldwide  operations.  A
reporting  system  is in place  which  evaluates  the  impact  on the  Company's
earnings  resulting from changes in interest rates,  currency exchange rates and
other  relevant  market  risks.  This  system is  structured  to  enable  senior
management to initiate prompt remedial action,  if appropriate,  and results are
periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee.

      At December 31, 1999 and 1998,  the Company had forward  foreign  exchange
contracts  outstanding  with an  aggregate  notional  principal  amount  of $893
million and $865 million,  respectively,  most of which were  denominated in the
Company's major international market currencies.  These contracts  predominantly
hedge certain  intercompany  receivables  and payables which are not recorded in
the respective company's  functional currency.  The terms of these contracts are
generally three months or less.

      At December 31, 1999, the Company had Japanese yen 16.3 billion  aggregate
notional  principal  amount of cross  currency  interest  rate swaps.  The swaps
convert a portion of the  Company's  U.S.  dollar  floating rate debt into fixed
rate Japanese yen debt and  effectively  hedge the  Company's net  investment in
Japanese yen denominated assets.

      At  December  31,  1999 and  1998,  the  Company  had no other  derivative
contracts outstanding.

Year 2000 Issue

      The  Company  did  not  experience  any  significant   disruption  to  its
operations related to computer system programming  failures or errors associated
with the year 2000. The  out-of-pocket  costs incurred in 1999 for its Year 2000
remediation program were not material to the consolidated  results of operations
for the year ended December 31, 1999.  These costs,  substantially  all of which
were  expensed,   include  third  party  consultants  and  the  replacement  and
remediation  of  existing  computer  software  and  hardware.  Such costs do not
include internal  management time, the effects of which were not material to the
Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

      Cash and cash  equivalents  decreased  $72.4 million during 1999 to $576.4
million at December 31, 1999.  The Company's  positive net cash flow provided by
operating  activities  was  maintained.  After annual cash outlays for dividends
paid to shareholders and minority  interests and the repurchase of the Company's
common  stock,  primarily for employee  programs,  the balance of the cash flow,
together  with the proceeds from the issuance of debt  obligations,  was used to
fund acquisitions, make capital expenditures and repay debt obligations.

      The Company maintains two revolving credit facilities with a consortium of
banks. One facility, for $500 million,  expires June 30, 2003 and the other, for
$750 million,  expires April 28, 2000 (commitments have been delivered to extend
this facility  until April 28, 2001).  Under the terms of these  facilities  the
Company may either borrow directly or issue  commercial  paper.  During the year
approximately  $6,663 million of commercial  paper was issued and $6,584 million
was redeemed.  The average term of the commercial paper was 21 days. At December
31, 1999,  approximately  $79 million of  commercial  paper was  outstanding  at
interest rates ranging from 6.35% to 6.48%.

      On June 24, 1998, the Company issued French Franc 1 billion (approximately
$164 million at the June 24, 1998 exchange rate) of 5.20% Notes with a scheduled
maturity in 2005.

      On March 4, 1998, the Company issued  4,000,000 shares of common stock for
aggregate proceeds before expenses of $171 million.

      On January 6, 1998, the Company  issued $230 million of 2 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity in 2013. The debentures are
convertible into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $49.83 per
share subject to adjustment in certain events.  Debenture holders have the right
to require the Company to redeem the debentures on January 6, 2004 at a price of
118.968%,  or upon the  occurrence  of a Fundamental  Change,  as defined in the
indenture agreement,  at the prevailing redemption




price. The Company may redeem the debentures, as a whole or in part, on or after
December 31, 2001 initially at 112.841% and at increasing  prices  thereafter to
118.968% until January 6, 2004, and 100%  thereafter.  Unless the debentures are
redeemed,  repaid,  or converted  prior thereto,  the debentures  will mature on
January 6, 2013 at their principal amount.

      On  January  3,  1997,  the  Company  issued   $218.5  million  of  4 1/4%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity  in 2007.  The
debentures  are  convertible  into common  stock of the Company at a  conversion
price of $31.50 per share  subject to adjustment  in certain  events.  Debenture
holders  have the right to  require  the  Company to redeem  the  debentures  on
January 3, 2003 at a price of 112.418%,  or upon the occurrence of a Fundamental
Change,  as defined in the indenture  agreement,  at the  prevailing  redemption
price. The Company may redeem the debentures, as a whole or in part, on or after
December 29, 2000 initially at 108.324% and at increasing  prices  thereafter to
112.418% until January 2, 2003, and 100%  thereafter.  Unless the debentures are
redeemed,  repaid or converted  prior  thereto,  the  debentures  will mature on
January 3, 2007 at their principal amount.

      On March 1, 1996,  the Company issued  Deutsche Mark 100 million  Floating
Rate Bonds due March 1, 1999. The bonds matured on March 1, 1999 and were repaid
at par. The bonds were unsecured,  unsubordinated obligations of the Company and
bore  interest at a per annum rate equal to Deutsche Mark three month LIBOR plus
0.375%.

      The  Company  maintains  relationships  with a number of banks  worldwide,
which  have  committed  to lines of credit  in  amounts  sufficient  to meet the
Company's cash needs. At December 31, 1999, the Company had $1,420.9  million in
such committed lines of credit,  comprised of a $750 million unsecured revolving
credit  agreement  expiring  on  April  28,  2000 and a $500  million  unsecured
revolving  credit  agreement  expiring  June 30, 2003, as discussed  above,  and
$170.9 million in lines of credit,  principally outside of the United States. Of
the $1,420.9 million in committed  lines,  $127.1 million were drawn at December
31, 1999.  Management  believes that the Company's  operating cash flow combined
with its available lines of credit  (including the expected  renewal of the $750
million revolving line of credit) are sufficient to support its foreseeable cash
requirements  including  dividends,   capital  expenditures,   acquisitions  and
maintenance of working capital.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

      The management of Omnicom Group Inc. is  responsible  for the integrity of
the financial data reported by the Company and its subsidiaries. Management uses
its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position and results of operations
of Omnicom Group Inc. and  subsidiaries.  These  financial  statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      The system of internal controls of the Company,  augmented by a program of
internal  audits,  is designed to provide  reasonable  assurance that assets are
safeguarded  and records are  maintained  to  substantiate  the  preparation  of
accurate financial information.  Underlying this concept of reasonable assurance
is the premise that the cost of control  should not exceed the benefits  derived
therefrom.

      The  financial   statements  have  been  audited  by  independent   public
accountants.  Their report expresses an independent  informed judgment as to the
fairness of management's  reported operating  results,  cash flows and financial
position.  This  judgment  is based on the  procedures  described  in the second
paragraph of their report.

      The Audit Committee meets  periodically with  representatives of financial
management, internal audit and the independent public accountants to assure that
each is properly  discharging their  responsibilities.  Additionally,  the Audit
Committee met  periodically to review  progress  against the Company's Year 2000
readiness  plan. In order to ensure complete  independence,  the Audit Committee
communicates  directly and separately with the independent  public  accountants,
internal audit and financial  management to discuss the results of their audits,
the  adequacy  of internal  accounting  controls  and the  quality of  financial
reporting.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
  Shareholders of Omnicom Group Inc.:

      We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Omnicom
Group Inc. (a New York corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, and related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 1999.
These consolidated  financial  statements and the schedule referred to below are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated  financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance  with auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  financial  position of Omnicom  Group Inc. and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1999  and  1998,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

      Our  audits  were made for the  purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule on page S-1 is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  fairly states in all material  respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

                                                             ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

          Business.  Omnicom Group Inc., through its wholly and  partially-owned
companies (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or the "Omnicom
Group"),  provides corporate  communications  services to clients worldwide on a
global,  pan-regional,  national  and local  basis.  Operations  cover the major
regions of North America, the United Kingdom,  Germany, France, the remainder of
Continental Europe, Latin America, the Far East, Australia,  the Middle East and
Africa.  In  both  1999  and  1998,  approximately  50% of the  Omnicom  Group's
commissions  and fees  came from its  non-U.S.  operations.  The  communications
services  offered by the Company  include  advertising  in various media such as
television,  radio, newspaper,  magazines,  outdoor and the internet, as well as
public  relations,  specialty  advertising,   direct  response  and  promotional
marketing,  strategic media planning and buying,  and internet and digital media
development.

          Recognition of Commission and Fee Revenue.  Substantially all revenues
are  derived  from  fees for  manpower  and for  production  of  advertisements.
Additionally,   revenues  are  derived  from   commissions   for   placement  of
advertisements  in  various  media.  Revenue  is  realized  when the  service is
performed,  in accordance  with the terms of the  contractual  arrangement,  and
collection  is  reasonably   assured.   Billings  are  generally  rendered  upon
completion of the earnings process, including: upon presentation date for media,
when  manpower  is used,  when  costs are  incurred  for  radio  and  television
production and when print production is completed.

          Principles of Consolidation.  The accompanying  consolidated financial
statements  include the  accounts of Omnicom  Group Inc.  and its  domestic  and
international   subsidiaries  (the  "Company").   All  significant  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

          Restatement and Reclassifications. As discussed in Note 2, on February
10, 1999 the Company  completed  the  acquisition  of Abbott Mead Vickers  Group
Limited (formerly known as Abbott Mead Vickers plc) ("AMV"). The AMV acquisition
was  accounted for as a  pooling-of-interests.  All prior year amounts have been
restated to include the accounts of AMV. In addition, certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform with the 1999 presentation.

          Investments  Available-For-Sale.  Substantially  all of the  Company's
investments     are     classified    as     available-for-sale.     Investments
available-for-sale,  that consist principally of short-term investments and time
deposits with  financial  institutions  with original  maturity  dates between 3
months and one year, are  classified as current  assets.  Strategic  investments
available-for-sale,  which consist  principally of publicly traded securities in
interactive marketing agencies, are classified as long-term investments.

          Billable  Production.  Billable  production  orders in process consist
principally of costs incurred in providing corporate  communications services to
clients.  Such amounts are  generally  billed to clients when  manpower is used,
when  costs are  incurred  for radio and  television  production  and when print
production is completed.

          Common  Stock.  Wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of the Company have issued
securities  which are  exchangeable  into  common  stock of the  Company  at the
holders'  option.  Shares of common  stock  issuable  on the  exchange  of these
securities are included in common stock issued at December 31, 1999.

          Treasury Stock.  The Company  accounts for treasury share purchases at
cost.  The  reissuance of treasury  shares is accounted for at the average cost.
Gains or losses on the  reissuance  of  treasury  shares  are  accounted  for as
additional paid-in capital.

          Foreign Currency Translation.  The Company's financial statements were
prepared  in  accordance  with  the   requirements  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." Under this
method,  net transaction  gains of $9.9 million,  $15.2 million and $3.6 million
are included in 1999, 1998 and 1997 net income, respectively.

          Earnings Per Common Share.  Basic earnings per share is based upon the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding  during each year. Diluted
earnings  per share is based on the  above,  plus,  if  dilutive,  common  share
equivalents  which include  outstanding  options and restricted  shares,  and if
dilutive, adjusted for the assumed conversion of the Company's 2 1/4% and 4 1/4%
Convertible  Subordinated Debentures (assumed to be converted for the full year)
and the assumed  increase in net income for the after tax interest cost of these
debentures.  For purposes of computing  diluted earnings per share for the years
ended December

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, 3,046,904, 3,518,600 and 3,174,000 shares
were assumed to have been  outstanding  related to common share  equivalents and
11,551,936,  and 6,936,500 shares in 1999 and 1998, respectively were assumed to
have  been  converted   related  to  the  Company's   convertible   subordinated
debentures.  Additionally,  the  assumed  increase  in net  income  used  in the
computations  was  $17,968,000,  $9,627,900  and  $318,300  for the years  ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The number of shares used in the
computations were as follows:

                                        1999             1998            1997

Basic EPS computation ..........     175,285,932     173,104,700     166,857,300
Diluted EPS computation ........     189,884,772     183,559,800     170,031,300

      For  purposes of computing  diluted  earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 1998, the Company's 2 1/4% Convertible  Subordinated Debentures and
for the  year  ended  December  31,  1997  the 4 1/4%  Convertible  Subordinated
Debentures,  were not reflected in the  computation as inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive.

      Gains and Losses on  Issuance  of Stock in  Affiliates  and  Subsidiaries.
Gains  and  losses on the  issuance  of stock in equity  method  affiliates  and
consolidated subsidiaries are recognized directly in the Company's shareholder's
equity  through an increase or decrease to additional  paid-in  capital,  in the
period in which the sale occurs.

      Severance  Agreements.   Arrangements  with  certain  present  and  former
employees  provide  for  continuing  payments  for  periods up to 10 years after
cessation of their full-time  employment in consideration  for agreements by the
employees  not to  compete  and  to  render  consulting  services  in  the  post
employment  period.  Such  payments,  which are  determined,  subject to certain
conditions and limitations,  by earnings in subsequent periods,  are expensed in
such periods.

      Depreciation  of Furniture  and Equipment  and  Amortization  of Leasehold
Improvements.  Depreciation  charges are  computed on a  straight-line  basis or
declining  balance  method over the  estimated  useful  lives of  furniture  and
equipment,   up  to  10  years.   Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the lesser of the terms of the  related  lease or the
useful life of these assets.

      Intangibles. Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair
value of tangible net assets of purchased  subsidiaries.  The intangible  values
associated with the Company's  business consist  predominantly of two types: the
value of the  worldwide  agency  networks  and  agency  brands  and the value of
ongoing client relationships.  The Company's worldwide agency networks have been
operating  for an  average  of over 60 years  and  intangibles  associated  with
enhancing  network  value are  intended  to enhance the  long-term  value of the
networks. Client relationships in the corporate communications services industry
are  typically  long-term in nature and the  Company's  largest  clients have on
average been clients for more than 25 years. As such,  intangibles are amortized
on a straight-line  basis  principally over a period of 40 years. Each year, the
intangibles  are written down if, and to the extent,  they are  determined to be
impaired.  Intangibles  are considered to be impaired if the future  anticipated
undiscounted cash flows arising from the use of the intangibles is less than the
net unamortized cost of the intangibles.

      Deferred  Taxes.  Deferred tax  liabilities and tax benefits relate to the
recognition  of certain  revenues and expenses in different  years for financial
statement and tax purposes and to differences  between the tax and book basis of
assets and  liabilities  recorded in connection  with  acquisitions,  unrealized
gains and losses on investments  available for sale and the issuance of stock in
affiliates.


                                      F-8


                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      Cash Flows.  The Company's  cash  equivalents  are primarily  comprised of
investments in overnight interest-bearing  deposits,  commercial paper and money
market instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less.

      The following  supplemental schedule summarizes the fair value of non-cash
assets  acquired,  cash paid,  common shares  issued  (valued at the then market
value of the shares and excluding shares related to the AMV acquisition) and the
liabilities  assumed in connection with the  acquisition of equity  interests in
subsidiaries and affiliates, for each of the three years ended December 31:



      Concentration   of   Credit   Risk.   The   Company   provides   corporate
communications  services to a wide range of clients who operate in many industry
sectors around the world.  The Company  grants credit to all qualified  clients,
but does not believe it is exposed to any undue  concentration of credit risk to
any significant degree.

      Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments consist
principally of forward foreign  exchange  contracts and interest rate swaps. For
derivative  financial  instruments to qualify for hedge accounting the following
criteria must be met: (a) the hedging  instrument must be designated as a hedge;
(b) the hedged exposure must be specifically identifiable and expose the Company
to risk;  and (c) it must be highly  probable that a change in fair value of the
derivative  financial instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the
hedged  exposure  will have a high degree of  correlation.  The  majority of the
Company's derivative activity relates to forward foreign exchange contracts. The
Company  executes these  contracts in the same currency as the hedged  exposure,
whereby 100% correlation is achieved.  Gains and losses on derivative  financial
instruments  which are hedges of existing  assets or liabilities are included in
the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately recognized
in income as part of those  carrying  amounts.  Interest  received  and/or  paid
arising from swap  agreements  which qualify as hedges are  recognized in income
when the interest is receivable  or payable.  Derivative  financial  instruments
which do not qualify as hedges are  revalued to the current  market rate and any
gains or losses are recorded in income in the current period.

      Use of Estimates.  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Acquisitions

      On February 10, 1999,  the Company  completed the  acquisition of AMV. AMV
provides corporate  communications services to clients principally in the United
Kingdom. The Company issued approximately 9.6 million shares of new common stock
in  exchange  for the 92.3% of AMV  ordinary  shares  not  already  owned by the
Company, at a fixed exchange ratio of .1347 common shares of the Company per AMV
ordinary share. The transaction was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting.  Accordingly, the Company's financial statements have been
restated to include the operating results of AMV for all periods presented.

      Selected financial  information for the combining entities included in the
consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997
are as follows (in thousands):

                                                  1998                  1997

      The restated results reflect the impact of including the operating results
of AMV, net of adjustments to eliminate  inter-company  transactions between AMV
and the  Company,  and to conform  AMV  accounting  methods to those used by the
Company.

      During 1999, the Company made several other  acquisitions  whose aggregate
cost,  in cash or by issuance of the  Company's  common  stock,  totaled  $748.6
million for net assets,  which included intangible assets of $489.3 million. Due
to the nature of corporate  communications  services  companies,  the  companies
acquired by the Company  generally  have  tangible  net  liabilities  or minimal
tangible  net assets.  Valuations  of these  companies  are based on a number of
factors,  including the competitive  position of each company's  agency networks
and agency brands.  Included in both figures are payments of $137.0 million made
in 1999 related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

      Certain acquisitions completed in 1999 and prior years require payments in
future  years if  certain  results  are  achieved  by the  companies  that  were
acquired. Formulas for these contingent future payments vary from acquisition to
acquisition.  Contingent  future payments are not expected to be material to the
Company's results of operations or financial position.

      In   January   1998,   the   Company   completed   the   acquisitions   of
Fleishman-Hillard,  Inc., GPC International Holdings Inc. and Palmer Jarvis Inc.
These acquisitions were accounted for under the  pooling-of-interests  method of
accounting  and,  accordingly,  the results of operations  of  Fleishman-Hillard
Inc., GPC International  Holdings Inc. and Palmer Jarvis Inc. have been included
in the  consolidated  financial  statements  since  January 1, 1998.  Prior year
consolidated  financial statements were not restated as the impact on such years
was not material.  The number of shares of common stock issued by the Company in
connection with these acquisitions was 3,550,366.

      In February 1997, the Company  completed the acquisitions of Cline Davis &
Mann, Inc. and Gavin Anderson & Company (Japan), Inc. Both of these acquisitions
were  accounted for under the  pooling-of-interests  method of  accounting  and,
accordingly,  the results of  operations  of Cline Davis & Mann,  Inc. and Gavin
Anderson  &  Company  (Japan),  Inc.  have  been  included  in the  consolidated
financial  statements since January 1, 1997. Prior year  consolidated  financial
statements  were not  restated as the impact on such years was not  material.  A
total of 1,088,974  shares of common stock were issued in connection  with these
acquisitions.

      In  May  1996,   the  Company   completed  the   acquisition   of  Ketchum
Communications  Holdings,  Inc.  ("Ketchum").  The acquisition was accounted for
under  the  pooling-of-interests  method of  accounting  and,  accordingly,  the
results  of  operations  of  Ketchum  have  been  included  in the  consolidated
financial  statements since January 1, 1996. Prior year  consolidated  financial
statements  were not  restated as the impact on such years was not  material.  A
total of 2,413,706  shares of common stock were issued in  connection  with this
acquisition.

3. Bank Loans and Lines of Credit

          Bank loans of $47.7 million and $56.4 million at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively,  are primarily comprised of bank overdrafts of international
subsidiaries,  which are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to bank agreements.
The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings  outstanding as of


                                      F-10


                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December  31, 1999 and 1998 was 6.37% and 6.62%,  respectively.  At December 31,
1999 and 1998, the Company had unsecured  committed lines of credit  aggregating
$1,420.9 million and $742.7 million,  respectively. The unused portion of credit
lines was  $1,293.8  million and $686.4  million at December  31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The lines of credit,  including the credit  facilities  discussed
below,  are  generally  extended at lending  rates that the banks grant to their
most creditworthy borrowers.

      On April 30,  1999,  the Company  entered  into a $750  million  revolving
credit  agreement  (the "$750 million  credit  facility"),  with a consortium of
banks expiring on April 28, 2000.

      The $750 million credit facility is used primarily to support the issuance
of  commercial  paper.  The  Company  had  $79.4  million  of  commercial  paper
borrowings  outstanding  with  interest  rates ranging from 6.35% to 6.48% as of
December  31,  1999,  which  matured on January 27,  2000.  The gross  amount of
commercial paper issued and redeemed, under this facility, during the year ended
December  31,  1999  was  $4,617  million  and  $4,538  million,   respectively.
Commercial  paper is  included in  long-term  debt in the  consolidated  balance
sheet,  as it is the  Company's  intention to refinance  these  borrowings  on a
long-term  basis through  continued  commercial  paper  borrowings  supported by
available bank facilities (see Note 7).

      On February 20, 1998,  the Company  established  a $500 million  revolving
credit  agreement  (the "$500 million  credit  facility"),  expiring on June 30,
2003.  There were no borrowings  under this credit facility at December 31, 1999
and 1998.

      The  $500  million  credit  facility  also  allows  for  the  issuance  of
commercial paper backed by a bank letter of credit issued under the terms of the
credit  facility.  The Company had no commercial  paper  outstanding  under this
agreement as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. The gross amount of commercial paper
issued and  redeemed,  during the year under this  facility was $2,046  million,
$4,231 million and $2,017 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

4. Employee Stock Plans

      Stock Options and Restricted Stock.  Under the terms of the Company's 1998
Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1998 Plan"),  4,958,074 shares of common stock
of the Company have been reserved as of December 31, 1999 for  restricted  stock
awards and  non-qualified  stock  options to key  employees of the Company.  The
maximum  number of shares of common  stock of the Company that may be granted in
any calendar year, under the 1998 Plan, is 1.5% of the total number of shares of
common stock issued and  outstanding on the first day of that calendar year. Any
remaining  reserved  shares of common  stock may be carried  over to  subsequent
years.  The remaining number of such reserved shares was 747,653 at December 31,
1999.  Awards under the Company's 1987 Stock Plan, as amended (the "1987 Plan"),
ceased to be made when the Company adopted the 1998 Plan.

      As permitted by SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based  Compensation,"
the  Company  intends to  continue  to apply the  accounting  provisions  of APB
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees," and to make annual
pro  forma  disclosures  of the  effect of  adopting  the fair  value  method of
accounting  for  employee  stock  options  and similar  instruments.  During the
initial   periods  of  disclosure,   the  effects  on  net  income  may  not  be
representative of the effects in future years due to the transitional provisions
included in SFAS No. 123.

      Pursuant  to the 1987  Plan and 1998  Plan  (the  "Plans"),  the  price of
options  awarded  may not be less than 100% of the market  value of the stock at
the date of the grant.  Options become  exercisable 30% on each of the first two
anniversary  dates of the grant  date with the  final 40%  becoming  exercisable
three years from the grant date.

      ESPP.  Effective  September 1, 1999 the Company  adopted the Omnicom Group
Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP").  The ESPP enables  substantially
all domestic  employees to purchase full or  fractional  shares of the Company's
common stock through payroll  deductions of up to 10% of eligible  compensation.
The price an employee  pays is 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date
of that plan quarter.  During 1999 employees  purchased  63,408  shares,  all of
which were  treasury  shares,  for which $4.8  million was paid to the  Company.
Under the ESPP 2,936,592 shares remain reserved at December 31, 1999.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      A summary of the status of the  Company's  stock option plan for the three
years ended December 31, 1999 is as follows:



      The following table summarizes  information about options  outstanding and
options exercisable at December 31, 1999:



      Pro forma. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1999,
1998 and 1997 was $20.91,  $11.45 and $6.27 per option,  respectively.  The fair
value of each  option  grant has been  estimated  on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:



      Using  compensation  cost for grants of the  Company's  stock  options and
shares issued under the ESPP,  determined  based on the estimated  fair value at
the  grant  or  issuance  date in  1999,  1998  and  1997,  consistent  with the
provisions  of SFAS No. 123, the effect on the  Company's  net income and income
per share would have been as follows:

      Restricted   Shares.  A  summary  of  changes  in  outstanding  shares  of
restricted stock for the three years ended December 31, 1999 is as follows:



      All  restricted  shares  granted  under the Plans were sold at a price per
share  equal to their par value.  The  difference  between  par value and market
value  on the date of the  sale is  charged  to  shareholders'  equity  and then
amortized  to expense  over the  period of  restriction.  Under the  Plans,  the
restricted  shares become  transferable to the employee in 20% annual increments
provided the employee remains in the employ of the Company.

      Restricted  shares  may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise
encumbered until the restrictions lapse. Under most circumstances,  the employee
must  resell  the  shares to the  Company  at par value if the  employee  ceases
employment prior to the end of the period of restriction.

      The charge to operations in connection with these  restricted stock awards
for the years ended December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997 amounted to $27.8 million,
$21.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively.

5. Segment Reporting

      The Company's  wholly-owned and partially-owned  businesses operate within

6. Investments in Affiliates

      The Company has in excess of 65  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted for
under the equity  method.  The  equity  method is used when the  Company  has an
ownership  of less  than  50%  and  exercises  significant  influence  over  the
operating  and  financial  policies  of  the  affiliate.   The  following  table
summarizes   the  balance   sheets  and  income   statements  of  the  Company's
unconsolidated affiliates, primarily in the United States, Europe and Australia,
as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, and for the years then ended:

      Net income .....................   23,662      33,183        46,834

      The  Company's  equity in the net income of these  affiliates  amounted to
$15.4  million,  $20.6  million  and  $25.7  million  for  1999,  1998 and 1997,
respectively.  The  Company's  equity  in  the  net  tangible  assets  of  these
affiliated companies was approximately $174.0 million,  $110.5 million and $83.1
million at  December  31,  1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Included in the
Company's  investments in affiliates is the excess of acquisition costs over the
fair value of tangible net assets acquired.  These excess  acquisition costs are
being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis  principally  over a period of forty
years.  In 1999 and  1998,  the  Company  disposed  of  shares  held in  certain
affiliates. The resulting impact of these sales was not material to the 1999 and
1998 consolidated results of operations or financial position.

      In April 1999, Razorfish,  Inc. (Razorfish),  an affiliate of the Company,
issued shares of its common stock in an initial  public  offering.  The Company,
through a wholly-owned subsidiary, owned 32.4% of Razorfish's equity immediately
following the initial public offering.  Consistent with the Company's accounting
policy and based on an  offering  price of $16 per  share,  an after tax gain of
$5.1 million was recognized by the Company in  shareholders'  equity as a direct
increase to additional  paid-in capital.  During the fourth quarter of 1999, the
Company's  ownership interest in Razorfish was diluted below 20% and as a result
the Company discontinued  accounting for its investment under the equity method.
The Company's investment in Razorfish is carried at market value.  Substantially
all of the Company's long-term  investments on the consolidated Balance Sheet at
December  31,  1999 are  comprised  of shares  in  Razorfish.  Unrealized  gains
resulting  from an increase in the market  value of the  Company's  common stock
shareholdings of Razorfish were recorded in comprehensive  income since the date
the equity method of accounting was discontinued.

      In December 1999,  AGENCY.com  Ltd (AGENCY),  an affiliate of the Company,
issued shares of its common stock in an initial  public  offering.  The Company,
through a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  owns 36% of AGENCY's  equity.  Based on an
offering  price of $26 per  share,  an  after  tax  gain of  $17.6  million  was
recognized  by the  Company  in  shareholders'  equity as a direct  increase  to
additional  paid-in  capital.  The Company accounts for its investment in AGENCY
under the equity  method.  At December  31,  1999,  the fair market value of the
Company's  investment  in AGENCY was $944  million,  which amount  substantially
exceeded its carrying value.

7. Long-Term Debt and Convertible Subordinated Debentures

      Long-term debt and convertible  subordinated  debentures outstanding as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998 consisted of the following:



      On April 30,  1999,  the Company  entered  into a $750  million  revolving
credit  agreement  with a consortium of banks  expiring on April 28, 2000.  This
credit  agreement  supports  the  facility  for issuing  commercial  paper.  The
remaining  borrowing  capacity  under this  agreement  at December  31, 1999 was
$670.6 million.

      On June 24,  1998,  the  Company  issued  French  Franc 1 billion of 5.20%
Notes. The Notes are unsecured,  unsubordinated  obligations of the Company. The
Notes are subject to redemption in whole at their principal amount at the option
of the Company at any time in the event of certain changes affecting taxation in
the United States. Unless previously redeemed,  or purchased and cancelled,  the
Notes will be redeemed at their principal amount on June 24, 2005.

      In March 1998, the Company  issued  floating rate Loan Notes in connection
with the  acquisition  of the GGT  Group  plc.  The  Loan  Notes  are  unsecured
obligations and bear interest at a yearly rate offered in the London  Inter-Bank
Market for six month deposits of sterling. The Loan Notes are redeemable, at the
option of the holder, in whole or in part at their nominal amount, together with
accrued  interest on any interest  payment date after  December 31, 1998.  Under
certain  conditions,  the Company may redeem the Loan  Notes,  at their  nominal
amount plus accrued  interest on any interest  payment date.  Unless  previously
repaid,  redeemed or purchased and  cancelled,  the Loan Notes will be repaid on
June 30, 2001 at par.

      On February 20, 1998,  the Company  established  a $500 million  revolving
credit agreement (the "$500 million credit facility").  This $500 million credit
facility is with a consortium  of banks  expiring on June 30, 2003.  This credit
facility  includes a facility  for  issuing  commercial  paper  backed by a bank
letter of credit.  Because the  Company has the ability and intent to  refinance
commercial  paper on a long-term  basis under the $500 million credit  facility,
commercial  paper  borrowings  at  December  31,  1999  has been  classified  as
long-term.  The credit facility contains certain financial  covenants  regarding
the   ratio   of  total   consolidated   indebtedness   to  total   consolidated
capitalization,  the ratio of debt to cash flow, and a limitation on investments
in and loans to affiliates and unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 1999
the Company was in compliance with these convenants.

      On January 6, 1998, the Company issued $230 million of 2 1/4%  Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity in 2013. The debentures are

the  debentures,  as a whole or in part, on or after December 31, 2001 initially
at 112.841% and at increasing  prices  thereafter  to 118.968%  until January 6,
2004,  and 100%  thereafter.  Unless  the  debentures  are  redeemed,  repaid or
converted prior thereto,  the debentures will mature on January 6, 2013 at their
principal amount.

      On  January  3,  1997,  the  Company  issued  $218.5  million  of   4 1/4%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  with a scheduled  maturity  in 2007.  The
debentures  are  convertible  into common  stock of the Company at a  conversion
price of $31.50 per share  subject to adjustment  in certain  events.  Debenture
holders  have the right to  require  the  Company to redeem  the  debentures  on
January 3, 2003 at a price of 112.418%,  or upon the occurrence of a Fundamental
Change,  as defined in the indenture  agreement,  at the  prevailing  redemption
price. The Company may redeem the debentures, as a whole or in part, on or after

redeemed,  repaid or converted  prior  thereto,  the  debentures  will mature on
January 3, 2007 at their principal amount.

      On March 1, 1996,  the Company issued  Deutsche Mark 100 million  Floating
Rate Bonds. The bonds are unsecured,  unsubordinated  obligations of the Company
and bear  interest at a per annum rate equal to Deutsche  Mark three month LIBOR

redeemed  at the  option of the  issuer on any  interest  payment  date at their
principal  amount plus any accrued but unpaid  interest.  On August 18, 1997 and
October  1,  1997,  Deutsche  Mark 69  million  and  Deutsche  Mark 20  million,

repurchased.  The remaining  bonds matured on January 5, 2000 and were repaid at
par.

      Aggregate  maturities  on  long-term  debt  and  convertible  subordinated
debentures in the next five years are as follows:

      Deferred  income taxes are provided for the temporary  difference  between
the  financial  reporting  basis  and tax  basis  of the  Company's  assets  and
liabilities.  Deferred tax benefits result  principally  from recording  certain
expenses in the financial  statements which are not currently deductible for tax
purposes  and from  differences  between  the tax and book  basis of assets  and
liabilities  recorded in connection with acquisitions.  Deferred tax liabilities
result  principally  from  non-cash,   unrealized   financial   statement  gains
associated with investments and capital  transactions  related to initial public
offerings  of common  stock by  affiliates,  and  expenses  which are  currently
deductible  for tax  purposes,  but have not yet been  expensed in the financial
statements.

      Current  deferred tax benefits as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 were $30.0
million and $36.3 million,  respectively,  and were included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets.  Non-current  deferred tax benefits as of December 31,
1999 and 1998 were $120.3 million and $98.2 million,  respectively.  The Company
has concluded that it is probable that it will be able to realize these deferred
tax benefits in future periods.

      A provision has been made for additional  income and withholding  taxes on
the  earnings  of  international   subsidiaries  and  affiliates  that  will  be
distributed.

9. Employee Retirement Plans

      The Company's  international and domestic  subsidiaries provide retirement
benefits for their  employees  primarily  through  defined  contribution  plans.
Company  contributions  to the  plans,  which  are  determined  by the  board of
directors  of the  subsidiaries,  have been in  amounts  up to 15% (the  maximum
amount   deductible   for  federal   income  tax  purposes)  of  total  eligible
compensation  of  participating  employees.  Expenses  related to the  Company's
contributions to these plans amounted to $77.2 million,  $72.7 million and $59.2
million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

      The Company's pension plans are primarily  international.  These plans are
not  required  to report  to  governmental  agencies  pursuant  to the  Employee
Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Substantially  all of these
plans  are  funded  by fixed  premium  payments  to  insurance  companies  which
undertake  legal  obligations to provide  specific  benefits to the  individuals
covered. Pension expense amounted to $8.5 million, $5.2 million and $5.3 million
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

      Certain  subsidiaries  of the Company have executive  retirement  programs
under which benefits will be paid to participants or to their beneficiaries over
15 years  beginning at age 65 or death.  In addition,  other  subsidiaries  have
individual  deferred  compensation  arrangements  with certain  executives which
provide for payments over varying terms upon retirement, cessation of employment
or death. Some of the Company's domestic subsidiaries provide life insurance and
medical  benefits  for  retired  employees.  Eligibility  requirements  vary  by
subsidiary,  but generally include  attainment of a specified  combined age plus
years of service  factor.  The costs related to these benefits were not material
to the 1999,  1998 and 1997  consolidated  results of  operations  or  financial
position.

10. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

      At December 31, 1999, the Company was committed  under  operating  leases,
principally  for office  space.  Certain  leases are subject to rent reviews and
require payment of expenses under  escalation  clauses.  Rent expense was $341.6
million  in 1999,  $311.5  million  in 1998 and  $242.7  million  in 1997  after
reduction for rents received from subleases of $17.4 million,  $14.7 million and
$12.8  million,   respectively.

      Thereafter ................ 1,096,480           20,539           1,075,941

      The  present   value  of  the  gross  future   minimum  base  rents  under
noncancellable operating leases is $1,338.2 million.

      Where appropriate,  management has established reserves for the difference
between the cost of leased premises that were vacated and  anticipated  sublease
income.

      The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to
the ordinary  course of its business.  The Company  believes that the outcome of
all pending legal  proceedings  and unasserted  claims in the aggregate will not
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations,  consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

      The  following  table  presents the carrying  amounts and  estimated  fair
values of the  Company's  financial  instruments  at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Amounts in parentheses represent liabilities.



      The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial  instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Short-term investments:

      Short-term  investments which consist primarily of short-term  investments
and  investments  in  short-term  interest  bearing  instruments  with  original
maturity  dates  between  three  months  and one year are  carried at cost which
approximates fair value.

Long-term investments:

      Long-term investments consist of available-for-sale securities,  primarily
in the Company's  holdings in interactive  marketing  agencies that are publicly
traded. The investments are carried at market value and the unrealized gains and
losses on these securities are included in Shareholders' Equity.

Other investments:

      Included  in  deferred  charges  and  other  assets  are  other  long-term
investments carried at cost, which approximates estimated fair value.


                                      F-19


                       OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Long-term debt:
      A portion of the Company's long-term debt included floating rate debt, the
carrying value of which  approximates  fair value. The Company's  long-term debt
also included  convertible  subordinated  debentures and fixed rate senior debt.
The fair value of these  instruments  was  determined by reference to quotations
available  in markets  where these issues were traded.  The  quotations  for the
subordinated   debentures  primarily  reflected  the  conversion  value  of  the
debentures into the Company's common stock.

Financial Commitments:
      The  estimated  fair  values  of  derivative   positions  are  based  upon
quotations  received from  independent,  third party banks and represent the net
amount  required to terminate the  position,  taking into  consideration  market
rates and  counterparty  credit risk. The fair values of guarantees  principally
related to affiliated companies,  and letters of credit were based upon the face
value of the underlying instruments.

12. Financial Instruments and Market Risk

      The Company utilizes  derivative  financial  instruments  predominantly to
reduce certain market risks to which the Company is exposed.  These market risks
primarily  consist of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets
and  liabilities  of non-U.S.  operations  and the impact of changes in interest
rates on debt.  The Company's  derivative  activities  are limited in volume and
confined  to  risk  management  activities.  Senior  management  at the  Company
actively  participates  in the  quantification,  monitoring  and  control of all
significant  risks. A reporting system is in place which evaluates the impact on
the  Company's  earnings  resulting  from  changes in interest  rates,  currency
exchange  rates and other  relevant  market risks.  This system is structured to
enable senior  management to initiate  prompt remedial  action,  if appropriate.
Additionally,  senior management reports  periodically to the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors  concerning  derivative  activities.  In 1993,  the Audit
Committee  established  limitations on derivative  activities which are reviewed
annually.

      At December  31, 1999 and 1998,  the Company had Japanese yen 16.3 billion
aggregate  notional  principal amount of cross currency interest rate swaps. The
swaps convert a portion of the  Company's  U.S.  dollar  floating rate debt into
fixed rate Japanese yen debt and effectively  hedge the Company's net investment
in Japanese yen denominated assets.

      The Company enters into forward foreign exchange  contracts  predominately
to hedge intercompany  receivables and payables which are recorded in a currency
different  from  that in which  they  will  settle.  Gains  and  losses on these
positions  are  deferred  and  included  in the  basis of the  transaction  upon
settlement.  The terms of these contracts are generally three months or less. At
December 31, 1999 and 1998, the aggregate amount of intercompany receivables and
payables  subject to this  hedge  program  was $773  million  and $628  million,
respectively.  The  table  below  summarizes  by  major  currency  the  notional
principal   amounts  of  the  Company's   forward  foreign  exchange   contracts
outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 1998. The "buy" amounts  represent the U.S.
dollar  equivalent of commitments to purchase the respective  currency,  and the
"sell" amounts  represent the U.S. dollar  equivalent of commitments to sell the
respective currency.

      Comparatives have been restated to reflect the  rationalization  of the 11
eurozone currencies as a result of the introduction of the euro.

      The  derivative  financial  instrument  existing  during  the years  ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998 were entered into for the purpose of hedging  certain
specific  currency  and  interest  rate  risks.  As a result of these  financial
instruments,  the Company  reduced  financial risk in exchange for foregoing any
gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. In using
derivative  financial  instruments,   management  exchanged  the  risks  of  the
financial  markets for  counterparty  risk.  To minimize  counterparty  risk the
Company only enters into derivative  contracts with major  well-known banks that
have credit ratings equal to or better than the Company's.

13. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

      In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which the Company
is required to adopt  effective  January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 cannot be applied
retroactively.  SFAS No. 133  establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards
requiring  that  every  derivative   instrument  (including  certain  derivative
instruments  embedded in other  contracts)  be recorded in the balance  sheet as
either an asset or liability  measured at its fair value.  SFAS No. 133 requires
that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized  currently in earnings
unless  specific  hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special  accounting  for
qualifying  hedges  allows a  derivative's  gains and  losses to offset  related
results on the hedged item in the income statement,  and requires that a company
must formally document,  designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions
that receive hedge accounting. Once implemented, SFAS No. 133 must be applied to
(a) derivative  instruments and (b) certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
hybrid contracts that were issued,  acquired,  or  substantively  modified after
December 31, 1997.

      The  Company  intends to adopt SFAS No.  133 for its  fiscal  year  ending
December  31,  2001.  The  impact  of SFAS No.  133 on the  Company's  financial
statements will depend on a variety of factors,  including future interpretative
guidance from the FASB, the future level  forecasted and actual foreign currency
transactions,  the  extent of the  Company's  hedging  activities,  the types of
hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such instruments. However, the
Company does not believe the effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 will be material to
its financial position.
