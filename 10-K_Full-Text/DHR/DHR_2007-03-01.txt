PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

We derive our sales from the design, manufacture and marketing of professional, medical, industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong
brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions. Our business consists of four segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies, and Tools & Components.

We strive to create shareholder value through:

•

delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for our products and services;

•

upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and

•

upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies.

To accomplish these goals, we use a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (“DBS”), which are designed to continuously improve
business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. We also acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve the objectives described above. We will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with
existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect our overall growth and operating
results.

Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a
Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. (“DMI”) which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. We adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and were
reincorporated as a Delaware corporation following the 1986 annual meeting of our shareholders.

Operating Segments

Effective as of the date of this Annual Report, we have adopted a reporting structure of four segments, Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial
Technologies, and Tools & Components, rather than the three segments previously used. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect these four segments.

The table below describes the percentage of our total annual revenues attributable to each of the segments over each of the last three fiscal years:



Sales in 2006 by geographic destination were: United States, 51%; Europe, 30%; Asia, 12%; and other regions, 7%.
For additional information regarding our segments and sales by geography, please refer to Note 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION

Businesses in our Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical
customers various products and services for use in the performance of their work. Professional Instrumentation encompasses two strategic lines of business: environmental and electronic test. Sales for this segment in 2006 by geographic destination

************************************

The following
discussions of

Raw Materials, Intellectual Property, Competition, Seasonal Nature of Business, Backlog, Employee Relations, Research and Development, Government Contracts, Regulatory Matters, International Operations, Major Customers

and

Other Matters

include information common to all of our segments.

Raw Materials

Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a
large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business, although market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs
of steel and petroleum-based products, and with respect to the past year, non-ferrous metals as well. While non-ferrous metals and to a lesser extent certain types of steel remain subject to supply constraints, we believe that we will generally be
able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our
intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our
intellectual property. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to,
Danaher or its subsidiaries.

Competition

Although our
businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since our competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as
we do. Because of the diversity of products sold and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger
companies that have greater sales, marketing, research, and financial resources than we do. The number of competitors varies by product line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets served. Key
competitive factors typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business, as well as price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, and brand name.

Seasonal Nature of Business

General economic conditions have an
impact on our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end-markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, medical
and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products, and sales to the United States government are
often stronger in the third calendar quarter. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.

Backlog

Backlog is generally not considered a significant factor in our businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of
our products.

Employee Relations

At
December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 45,000 persons, of which approximately 21,000 were employed in the United States. Of these United States employees, approximately 2,700 were hourly-rated unionized employees. We also have
government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries. Though we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other
potential labor disputes.



Research and Development

The table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three fiscal years, by segment and in the aggregate:

We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products and services and
improving existing products and services. In particular, we emphasize the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.

Government Contracts

We have agreements relating to the sale of
products to government entities, primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense, product identification, water quality and motion businesses. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing
business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private
contracts. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are
also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of
costs. Our failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Regulatory Matters

Environmental, Health & Safety

Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and
establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with our operations.
Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

In addition to environmental compliance costs, we from time to time incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling
practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by
state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and
others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We have projects
underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or
other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.

We have made a provision for
environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims. We generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with



similar sites. If we determine that we have potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, we accrue the total estimated
costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. We also estimate our exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While we actively
pursue appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable. The ultimate
cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, we cannot assure that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.

In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, we believe that our liability related to past or
current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. For a discussion of risks related to past or future releases
of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Medical Devices

Certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and by the counterpart
agencies of the non-U.S. countries where our products are sold. Some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the United States.

Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the FDA regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture, sale, and distribution of medical devices, including their introduction into
interstate commerce, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping. Pursuant to the FDCA and FDA regulations, certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the FDA as medical device
manufacturing establishments. The FDA, as well as our ISO Notified Bodies, regularly inspect our registered and/or certified facilities.

We sell both
Class I and Class II medical devices. A medical device, whether exempt from, or cleared pursuant to, the premarket notification requirements of the FDCA, or cleared pursuant to a premarket approval application, is subject to ongoing regulatory
oversight by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, product labeling requirements and limitations, including those related to promotion and marketing efforts, current good manufacturing practices
and quality system requirements, record keeping, and medical device (adverse event) reporting. For a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the FDA and counterpart agencies of other countries, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk
Factors.”

In addition, certain of our products utilize radioactive material. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the
management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials.

Export Compliance

We are required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws, including:

•

the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things,
imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List);

•

the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing
requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications); and

•

the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated
countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations.

Non-United States
governments have also implemented similar export control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

International Operations

The table below describes annual net revenue by geographic destination outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual net revenue for each of the last three fiscal years, by segment and in the aggregate:



Our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia.

The table below describes long-lived assets located outside the United States as a percentage of total long-lived assets in each of the last three fiscal years, by

For additional information related to revenues and long-lived assets by country, please refer to Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our non-U.S. sales subsidiaries or from manufacturing entities
located outside the United States, though we also make sales outside the U.S. through various representatives and distributors and also sell into non-U.S. markets directly from the U.S. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally make sales
through representatives and distributors.

Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 15 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-US operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Major Customers

We have no customers that accounted for more than
10% of consolidated sales in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Other Matters

Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements. Our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks and
uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material,
but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, a global economic slowdown,
geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products.

Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a
wide variety of competitors. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers, establish relationships with new customers, continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our
leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability.

Technologies, product offerings and customer requirements in many of our markets change rapidly. If we fail to keep up with these changes, we may not be able to
meet our customers’ needs and demand for our products may decline. If we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products or use our services.

Rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and services characterize many of the markets we serve. Changes in regulations can also impact
demand for new products in our markets. Our failure to successfully embrace and respond to these changes and developments may reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully embrace and respond to
these changes and developments, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, if customers do not adopt the technologies that we develop or if those technologies ultimately prove not to be viable, our
revenues, cash flow and profitability may suffer.

Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested
capital. Conversely, any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate.

As part of our business
strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material. During 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired);
during 2005 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $885 million (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); and during 2004 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$1.6 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired). Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could cause significant operating
inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability:

•

Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it.

•

Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.

•

Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.

•

We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems.

•

We may be unable to achieve cost savings anticipated in connection with the integration of an acquired business.

•

We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known



liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase
our expenses and adversely affect our financial position.

Conversely, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to
the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize
anticipated cost savings. In addition, changes in accounting or regulatory requirements could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.

The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.

Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired
it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will fully
protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.

The resolution of
contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We have
retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, product liability claims and environmental matters, and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these
businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern
will continue.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of
third party intellectual property.

We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by
others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The steps we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Unauthorized use of our intellectual
property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, from time to time in the usual course of business, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or
misappropriation. In the event of a successful claim against us, we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, any of which could adversely impact our
revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even where we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.

We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims
relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters and acquisition-related matters. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as
compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable
remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.

Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and reputation.

Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions
in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with
various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. Failure to comply
with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and
health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we may incur
costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims
brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you
that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our



financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future
based on our past, present or future business activities.

Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation; failure to comply with
those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

In addition to the environmental
regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:

•

We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers,
business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products,
services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase
the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.

•

Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by counterpart agencies of other countries and by
regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning
letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions.

•

We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing
business with the government. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and
other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records
and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.

In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business,
limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.

Our reputation and our ability to do business
may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls
will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, competition, money laundering
and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries,
and could damage our reputation.

Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition or performance of, key distributors,
resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations.

Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of
their products to key distributors, resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products, and if they favor our
competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition or performance, could
adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other
employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may
not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses, effectively implement the Danaher Business System throughout our organization and achieve the cost savings and other benefits
that the effective implementation of the Danaher Business System can achieve, and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers
and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.



Cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.

Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have adversely
impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market. Any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and
drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. In addition, certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products
that they purchase from us. Any significant change in any of these regulations or reimbursement programs could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in currency exchange rates
and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of
materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our business and financial results will suffer.

We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient
quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may
increase. For example, although there have been no recent raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business, market forces during the past two years have caused significant increases in the costs of steel and
petroleum-based products, and with respect to the past year, non-ferrous metals as well.

In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost
structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an
opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.

Work stoppages,
union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.

We have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory relations
at our various locations, we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.

International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

In 2006, approximately 49% of our sales were derived outside the U.S. and we continue to increase our sales outside the U.S. In addition, many of
our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations and could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows,
financial condition and overall growth, including:

•

interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

•

trade protection measures;

•

import or export licensing requirements;

•

unexpected changes in laws or licensing and regulatory requirements;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;



•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property; and

•

terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto.

Audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The amount of income
taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to
our tax liabilities.

Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results.

Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in
publicly traded debt and equity securities, which are affected by market risks. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating
results.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington,
D.C. At December 31, 2006, we had 218 significant manufacturing and distribution locations worldwide, comprising approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 12 million square feet are owned and approximately
8 million square feet are leased. Of these manufacturing and distribution locations, 117 facilities are located in the United States and 101 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of
North America, Latin America and Australia. The number of manufacturing and distribution locations by business segment are:

•

Professional Instrumentation, 54;

•

Medical Technologies, 49;

•

Industrial Technologies, 78; and

•

Tools & Components, 37.

We consider our
facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Please refer to Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As previously reported, the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”) has informed Joslyn Sunbank Company LLC (“Joslyn Sunbank”), a subsidiary of the Company, that its Paso Robles, California facility allegedly violated certain provisions of the
California Hazardous Waste Control Law (“HWCL”) and related regulations. The DTSC alleges certain deficiencies related to recordkeeping and reporting matters, training and preventive measures and hazardous waste storage and handling
practices. The DTSC has acknowledged that Joslyn Sunbank is no longer in violation of the HWCL or related regulations and that Joslyn Sunbank has taken appropriate corrective action in response to the alleged violations. The DTSC and Joslyn
Sunbank have reached an agreement in principle whereby all of Joslyn Sunbank's alleged violations of the HWCL and related regulations would be settled for $495,000. The settlement agreement would also include certain injunctive relief under which
Joslyn Sunbank would agree to follow specified procedures relating to recordkeeping and reporting, training and preventive measures and hazardous waste storage and handling. The parties expect to reflect the terms of the agreement in principle in a
settlement agreement that is being negotiated. The Company does not believe that the final resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

In addition to the litigation noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety”, we are, from time to
time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters
and commercial disputes. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While we maintain workers compensation,
property, cargo, automobile, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that we believe covers a
portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. In addition, while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third



parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We believe that the
results of these litigation matters and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on our cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance or indemnification recoveries.

We maintain third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. We carry significant
deductibles and self-insured retentions under our insurance policies, and our management believes that we maintain adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Our management determines our accrual for self-insurance liability based on claims
filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEME

NT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and
analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements.

OVERVIEW

Danaher Corporation strives to create shareholder value through:

•

delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services;

•

upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and

•

upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies.

To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (“DBS”), which are designed to continuously
improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above. The Company will acquire businesses when they
strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can significantly affect the
Company’s overall growth and operating results.

Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. In 2006, approximately 49% of
Danaher’s sales were derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danaher’s geographic and industry
diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured
and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible
their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Company’s order rates are highly indicative of the Company’s future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry
segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Company’s customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses
and in the economy.

The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served. The
Company’s performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies it serves, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of
competitors, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, increasing significance of technology and intellectual property in the businesses in which the Company operates and recent increases in raw material costs. The Company will continue to
assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the acquisition of Sybron Dental Specialties, Inc. (Sybron Dental) and Vision Systems Limited
(Vision), Company management and other personnel are devoting significant attention to the successful integration of these businesses into Danaher.

The
Company has significantly expanded its medical technologies segment since it acquired its first medical technologies businesses in 2004. In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron Dental. Sybron Dental is a leading
manufacturer of a broad range of products for the dental professional and had annual revenues of approximately $650 million in its most recent completed fiscal year. Danaher paid total consideration of approximately $2 billion for the Sybron Dental
shares, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Sybron Dental is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s dental
business both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses.

In addition, in the
last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate price of approximately $520 million, including transaction costs and net of $122 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5
million of debt. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of approximately $86 million in its
last completed fiscal year. Management believes that the pairing of Vision with the Company’s existing life science instrumentation business, Leica, will significantly broaden the Company’s product offerings in the growing anatomical
pathology market and expand the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. The Company believes that the pairing of Leica and Vision will also create a broader base for the acquisition of complementary businesses in the
life sciences industry.

Danaher financed the acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to
a lesser extent from available cash. Under the global commercial paper program which the Company established in May 2006, the Company, or an indirect wholly-owned financing subsidiary of the Company, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term
promissory



notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.2 billion. The credit facilities provide credit support for the commercial paper program and have the
practical effect of reducing the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion.

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued approximately $630 million (€500 million) of 4.5% guaranteed notes due July 22, 2013 with a fixed re-offer price of 99.623 in a private
placement outside the U.S. (the “Eurobond Notes”). Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction
of other issuance costs, were €496 million and were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper issued to acquire Sybron Dental and for general corporate purposes.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS
No. 123R) which requires the Company to expense stock-based compensation. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption, which requires the Company to record compensation cost related
to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings.

Although the Company has a U.S. Dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales and profits are derived from foreign
countries. Sales and profits of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales and profits are affected by changes in currency rates, which
are outside of the control of management. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and
negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The borrowings under the Eurobond Notes, as well as
the European component of the commercial paper program, provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. On an overall basis, the U.S. Dollar weakened against other major currencies in 2006 and closed the
year at exchange rate levels weaker than the exchange rate levels as of the end of 2005.

While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, the
Company generally experienced broad-based sales growth in 2006. Revenue growth rates for each of the quarters of 2006 exceeded growth rates for each of the comparable quarters of 2005. Management believes that this revenue growth reflects the impact
of strong global economic conditions, the continued shift of the Company’s operations into higher growth sectors of the economy, the Company’s investments in growing new markets and products, comparisons against more modest sales growth
periods in 2005 and generally higher prices for the Company’s products in 2006 compared to 2005.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased approximately 20% over the comparable period of 2005. Sales from existing businesses (references to
“sales from existing businesses” in this report include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition, but exclude currency effect) contributed 6.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for
approximately 13% growth. The impact of currency translation on sales provided approximately 0.5% growth as the weakness of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies in the second half of 2006 more than offset the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar experienced in the first quarter of 2006. Price increases contributed approximately 1.5% growth on a year-over-year basis, and are included in the increase in sales from existing businesses.

The growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily related to acquisitions in the Company’s medical technologies business.
During 2005, the Company acquired four medical technologies businesses, the largest being the acquisition of Leica Microsystems AG in August 2005. The 2006 acquisitions of Sybron Dental in May 2006 and to a lesser extent Vision have also contributed
to this revenue growth.

Operating profit margins for the Company were 15.8% in the year ended December 31, 2006 essentially the same as in 2005.
Following are the key factors impacting the year-over-year comparison of operating profit margins:

•

As required by SFAS 123R, beginning in the first quarter of 2006 the Company began recording compensation cost related to stock option awards which decreased 2006
operating profit by approximately $55 million and reduced operating profit margins by 60 basis points on a year over year basis;

•

Operating profit margin improvements in the Company’s existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily Leica
and Vision, which reduced 2006 operating margins by 60 basis points on a year over year basis. These results include the expensing of approximately $6.5 million of in-process research and development in connection with the acquisition of Vision;



•

Gains related to the sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable in the second quarter of 2005 contributed approximately 10 basis
points to 2005 operating profit margins impacting the operating margin comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005;

•

A first quarter 2005 $5.3 million gain on the sale of real estate benefited 2005 operating margins by approximately 5 basis points impacting the operating margin
comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005;

•

A gain on the sale of the Company’s investment in First Technology plc in the second quarter of 2006 contributed approximately 15 basis points to 2006
operating profit margins impacting the operating margin comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2005;

•

A loss related to the settlement of patent infringement litigation in the fourth quarter of 2005 reduced operating profit margins by approximately 25 basis points
for the year ended December 31, 2005 impacting comparisons with operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 also benefited from on-going cost reduction initiatives including application of the Danaher Business System and low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the
additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Company’s low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives, are both
expected to further improve operating profit margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses, including Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision.

The
Company’s effective income tax rate of 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects benefits associated with reductions in valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized and
favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves. In addition, the Company’s tax provision was reduced as a result of a change in German tax law which
entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. The Company expects the tax rate for 2007 to be approximately 27%.

The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated:

PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION

The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic businesses: environmental and electronic test.

Professional Instrumentation Selected Financial Data



Components of Sales Growth

2006 COMPARED TO 2005

As detailed in the table above, segment sales increased 12% for 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Sales
from existing businesses increased in both of the Company's strategic lines of business.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 21.5% in 2006
compared to 20.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses which reduced segment operating margins by approximately 40 basis points in
2006 compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS 123R reduced operating profit for the segment by approximately $14.7 million and contributed to a 50 basis point reduction in operating profit margins in 2006 compared to 2005.

Operating profit margins from existing businesses benefited from on-going cost reduction initiatives through application of the Danaher Business System,
low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Company’s
low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives are both expected to further improve operating profit margins.

Overview of Businesses within
Professional Instrumentation Segment

Environmental.

Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 63% of
segment sales for 2006, increased approximately 10.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for approximately 8% growth. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 2% growth and the impact of currency translation accounted
for approximately 0.5% growth.

The Company’s water quality businesses reported mid-single digit sales growth for 2006. This growth was primarily the
result of strength in Hach/Lange’s laboratory and process instrumentation products in both the North American and European markets. Sales in Asia grew over 20% in 2006 reflecting continued penetration of these markets. The Company’s Hach
Ultra Analytics business reported mid-single digit growth in 2006. Sales growth in North America and Europe, as well as the impact of new product introductions, drove the improvements. Lower sales in Asia reflecting in part a difficult comparable
sales period in 2005 due to certain large projects not repeating in 2006, partially offset these improvements. These businesses continue to focus on growing markets in developing countries such as India and China to enhance their growth prospects.
Sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of three smaller acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006.

The Gilbarco Veeder-Root
retail petroleum product and service business reported high-single digit sales growth in 2006 compared to low single-digit sales growth in 2005. This growth was driven by extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory incentives in Mexico
that encouraged dispensers to be embedded with tamper proof capability. The businesses’ newly introduced dispensing equipment and its recently introduced point of sale equipment were favorably received which also contributed to this growth.

Electronic Test.

Sales from the Company’s electronic test businesses, representing approximately 37% of segment sales for 2006, grew 14.5%
compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 7.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation had a negligible impact.

Sales growth from existing businesses in 2006 continued the strong growth experienced throughout 2005. The business experienced high-single digit growth in traditional industrial channels in all major geographic
regions with particular strength in the Asian and Latin American markets. Demand for the businesses’ thermography and new power quality test products contributed significantly to



this overall growth. The Company’s network-test business reported mid-single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005. Sales growth slowed in North
America and Europe in 2006 compared to 2005 since 2005 benefited from several new product launches. The network-test business experienced somewhat stronger sales growth in China and Latin America in 2006 compared to 2005.

2005 COMPARED TO 2004

Sales of the Professional Instrumentation
segment increased 13.5% for 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the
Company’s strategic lines of business with the highest growth resulting from the electronic test and environmental water quality businesses. Sales in the Company’s environmental and retail petroleum automation business were up low-single
digits for the year.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 20.7% in 2005 compared to 20.9% for 2004. Operating profit margins in the segment for
2005 compared with 2004 were adversely impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. These recent acquisitions operate at lower overall operating profit margins than the segment’s ongoing businesses. Operating profit margins for 2005 were
also impacted by higher expense levels to support strategic growth initiatives in certain businesses. On-going cost reduction initiatives through the application of the Danaher Business System, low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and
the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period, partially offset these adverse impacts.

Overview of Businesses
within Professional Instrumentation Segment

Environmental.

Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately
64% of segment sales for 2005, increased approximately 12.5% in 2005 compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses accounted for approximately 5.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 7.5% growth. The impact of currency translation
was negligible for 2005 compared to 2004.

The Company’s Hach/Lange water quality businesses reported high-single digit growth in 2005 primarily
driven by mid-single digit growth in laboratory sales and low-double digit growth in process instrumentation sales in both the United States and European markets. New product launches in 2005 positively impacted process instrumentation sales. The
business’ sales in China also grew over 35% in 2005 on a year-over-year basis. The Company’s Hach Ultra Analytics business reported mid-single digit growth in 2005, driven primarily by high-single digit growth in the U.S. partially offset
by slowing sales in electronics end-markets and in Europe. Sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of Trojan Technologies in November 2004 and two smaller water quality businesses during 2005.

The Gilbarco Veeder-Root environmental and retail petroleum automation business reported low-single digit sales growth for 2005 compared to 2004. The
business experienced growth in sales of environmental equipment in Asia and Latin America. Sales in Europe were down compared to 2004, due in part to the fact that 2004 sales included the impact of a large shipment. Sales in the U.S. were flat
compared to 2004.

Electronic Test.

Sales from the Company’s electronic test businesses, representing approximately 36% of segment sales for
2005, grew 16.0% compared to 2004. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 8.5% growth and favorable currency translation accounted for 1.0% growth.

Sales growth from existing businesses for 2005 built on strong performance experienced by this business throughout 2004. Key contributors to the 2005 growth included
strength in the U.S. and European industrial and electrical channels, in each case driven by strong demand for recently introduced product offerings. Sales in China also showed strong growth during 2005. The Company’s network-test business
reported flat sales growth for 2005 compared to a very strong 2004. The business’s 2004 results benefited from delivery of a large shipment in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer.

MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES

The Medical Technologies segment consists of
businesses which offer dentists, other doctors and hospital and research professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work.



Medical Technologies Selected Financial Data

Components of Sales Growth

2006 COMPARED TO 2005

As detailed in the table above, segment sales increased 88% for 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2005.

The Company’s dental technology businesses experienced high-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Growth in the dental technology businesses was driven
by continued strength in the instrument product lines as well as strong sales of imaging product lines in North America and Asia driven by new product introductions. The Company completed two acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2006 which
will further enhance its imaging product offerings. Sybron Dental experienced low-double digit sales growth in 2006, however, all Sybron Dental sales are reported as a component of acquisition growth due to its May 2006 acquisition.

Radiometer’s critical care diagnostics business experienced mid-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Radiometer’s sales improved in all major
geographic regions with particular strength in sales of consumables in Europe resulting from broad based diagnostic instrument placements in the first half of 2006.

Leica’s life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Strength from the sale of stereo microscopes and specimen preparation equipment drove growth in Europe
and Asia, and to a lesser extent North America. Leica’s sales have been included as a component of sales from existing businesses since the first anniversary of the acquisition and were reported as a component of acquisition growth prior to
that anniversary date. Vision has been consolidated with the segment’s results as of the date the Company gained control of Vision in November 2006 and its sales are also included as a component of acquisition growth.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 11.8% in 2006 compared to 11.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing operations,
largely as a result of margin improvements within the dental technology businesses, were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily Leica and the expensing of in-process research and development in connection with the
acquisition of Vision which reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 by approximately 45 basis points compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS 123R resulted in approximately $6 million of stock
option compensation expense and reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 by approximately 30 basis points compared to 2005. The Company also recorded a $4.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2006 for impairment
of a minority interest in a medical technologies company, which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 20 basis points compared to 2005.

Operating profit margins from existing businesses benefited from on-going cost reduction initiatives through application of the Danaher Business System, low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created
from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our businesses, and the Company’s low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives are both expected to further improve
operating profit margins in the segment at both existing and newly acquired businesses, including Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision.



2005 COMPARED TO 2004

Sales of the Medical Technologies segment increased 75.5% for 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, were negligible in 2005 compared to 2004.

Radiometer’s business experienced mid-single digit growth for 2005 over the comparable period of 2004. This performance was primarily the result of growth in North
America and Japan, driven by placements of recently introduced products and related accessory sales, offset by weaker performance in Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the Company’s dental businesses experienced mid-single digit growth
in fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year 2005, the dental businesses sales growth was flat for the period of ownership, but would have reported mid-single digit growth on a full year pro forma basis had
they been included for a full year in both 2005 and 2004. Sales for 2005 were negatively impacted by changes in German reimbursement regulations as well as the reduction in promotional activity in 2005 while the business restructured certain German
operations which occurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Sales for 2005 benefited from strong growth experienced with the introduction of a new digital imaging product offering in the second half of 2005. The business also experienced
sales growth due to the third quarter launch of a sensor line with US distribution as well as strong sales growth at Pelton & Crane, a 2005 dental acquisition.

The results of Leica have been reflected in the Company’s results of operations since its acquisition in August 2005. Leica had annual revenues from continuing operations of approximately $540 million in 2004
(excluding approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor equipment business that was divested shortly after acquisition). Leica’s gross margins approximated the Company’s overall gross margins and did not had a
dilutive impact on gross margins in 2005. However, Leica’s operating profit margins are below the Company and segment average and were dilutive to the segment and overall Company operating margins.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 11.7% in 2005 compared to 11.3% for 2004. Operating profit margins in the segment for 2005 compared with 2004 were
adversely impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, principally Leica and KaVo. In addition, 2005 operating profit margins for the segment reflect additional costs associated with restructuring actions within the dental business, which
generally commenced in the third quarter of 2005. Operating profit margins for 2005 were also impacted by higher expense levels to support strategic growth initiatives in certain businesses. On-going cost reduction initiatives through the
application of the Danaher Business System, low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period, partially offset these adverse impacts.

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

The Industrial Technologies segment
encompasses two strategic businesses, motion and product identification, and three focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, sensors & controls and power quality.

Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data



2006 COMPARED TO 2005

Sales growth from existing businesses was due primarily to sales growth in the motion, aerospace and defense and sensor and controls businesses. Price increases, which are included as a component of sales from existing businesses,
contributed approximately 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Several small acquisitions in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 accounted for 1% growth.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.6% in 2006 compared to 14.7% in 2005. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth, on-going cost reductions associated
with Danaher Business System initiatives completed during 2005 and 2006, and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years, which typically have higher cost structures than the Company’s existing operations. Recently acquired
businesses had no dilutive impact on overall operating profit margins for 2006. The improvements to operating profit margins were partially offset by the implementation of SFAS 123R which required the Company to record approximately $14.5 million of
stock option compensation costs and reduced operating profit margins by 45 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating profit margin comparisons for 2006 compared to 2005 are also negatively impacted by 35 basis points related to gains on
sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable during 2005 and were positively impacted by 65 basis points related to a fourth quarter 2005 loss from the settlement of patent infringement litigation.

The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of the segment’s businesses, and the segment’s low-cost region sourcing and production
initiatives, are both expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in the segment in future periods.

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment

Motion.

Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing
approximately 33% of segment sales in 2006, increased approximately 6% over 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 5% growth; acquisitions accounted for approximately 0.5% growth and currency translation contributed growth of 0.5%.

Sales from existing businesses increased from 2005 levels due primarily to broad based growth across the standard and custom motor, drive and controls
lines. This growth was somewhat offset by softness in certain technology end markets. The business also experienced continued growth in sales of its linear products during 2006.

Product Identification.

The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2006. Sales from the Company’s product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2006
compared to 2005. Existing businesses provided 2.5% growth. Favorable currency impacts accounted for approximately 1% growth. Acquisitions had a negligible impact on growth for 2006.

The increase in sales is due primarily to the increase in sales of laser and thermal transfer overlay equipment as well as sales of consumables and services in North America and Europe. These increases in sales were
offset by the completion of several large United States Postal Service (“USPS”) projects in the first half of 2006 at both AccuSort and Videojet.

Focused Niche Businesses.

The segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed 11.5% sales growth in 2006 compared to 2005. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Company’s
sensors and controls and aerospace and defense businesses, and to a lesser extent in the Company’s power quality businesses.

2005 COMPARED TO 2004

Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased 11.0% in 2005 over 2004. Sales from existing businesses increased due primarily to sales growth
in the product identification and aerospace and defense businesses. Sales from existing businesses for the Company’s motion businesses were flat during 2005 compared to 2004. Price increases, which are included as a component of sales from
existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2004. The first quarter 2005 acquisition of Linx Printing Technologies PLC together with several other smaller acquisitions in 2005 accounted for a 6.0% increase in
segment sales. The impact of currency translation in the year was negligible.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.7% in 2005 including the
effect of a $15.5 million charge (0.5%) to settle litigation associated with activities of a business that occurred prior to the Company’s ownership of the business. Under U.S. generally



accepted accounting principles, the impact of this settlement is required to be accounted for in 2005 since the settlement occurred after December 31,
2005 but before the release of the 2005 financial statements. Operating profit margins were 14.6% in 2004. The improvements in operating profit margins for the year reflect additional leverage from sales growth; on-going cost reductions associated
with our Danaher Business System initiatives completed during 2004 and 2005, primarily within the Company’s motion businesses; and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years, which typically have higher cost structures than the
Company’s existing operations. Operating margin also benefited from a $4.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a small business which occurred in the second quarter of 2005. These positive impacts were partly offset by a $5 million impairment
charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005 related to a minority investment; the dilutive effects of operating margins from businesses recently acquired; and higher expense levels to support strategic growth and restructuring initiatives,
primarily in the product identification and motion businesses.

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment

Motion.

Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2005, increased approximately 2.5% compared to the same
period of 2004. Sales from existing businesses were flat compared with prior year levels; acquisitions accounted for approximately 2.5% growth in sales and the impact of currency translation was negligible.

Sales from existing businesses slowed from strong 2004 levels. The business continued to experience strength in its electric vehicle product line, although at lower
growth rates than experienced in 2004, as well as growth in the aviation and defense market. In addition, the elevator end-market showed continued strength in 2005. However, the business experienced softness in the technology and electronic assembly
end markets in 2005.

Product Identification.

The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28% of segment sales in 2005. Sales
from the Company’s product identification businesses increased 26.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. Existing businesses provided 9.5% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 16.0% growth, and favorable currency impacts accounted for approximately 0.5%
growth.

Sales of marking systems equipment and related service within the Videojet business for 2005 increased at mid-single digit rates over 2004. This
marking systems growth primarily resulted from strength in the North American, China and Latin American markets. The Company also continued to see growth in both its laser product offerings and thermal transfer overlay product offerings. The
Company’s increased sales and marketing efforts implemented earlier in 2005 also contributed to this growth. In addition, growth in sales from existing operations for 2005 were driven by strong systems installation sales within the Accu-Sort
scanning business, particularly sales to the United States Postal Service (USPS).

Focused Niche Businesses.

The segment’s niche businesses in
the aggregate showed 10.0% sales growth in 2005 compared to 2004. Growth in the existing businesses was primarily driven by sales growth from the Company’s aerospace and defense businesses, principally the electro-optical and safety product
lines as well as strength in the Company’s power quality businesses. These improvements were partially offset by slight declines in the Company’s sensors and controls business due to a slowing technology market and more difficult
comparisons with the business’ 2004 results which were strong by historical standards. 2005 sales were negatively impacted by 1.0% due to the sale of a small business in June 2005 for which previously reported sales have not been restated.

The Tools &
Components segment consists of one strategic line of business, mechanics hand tools, and four focused niche businesses: Delta Consolidated Industries, Hennessy Industries, Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company and Jacobs Vehicle Systems.

Tools & Components Selected Financial Data



Components of Sales Growth

2006 COMPARED TO 2005

Sales from existing businesses contributed substantially all of the growth for the segment in 2006, including approximately 1.5% growth due to price increases that the Company implemented largely as a result of cost increases in steel and
other commodities.

Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales, grew 5% in 2006 compared to 2005. The sales growth was
driven primarily by the group’s Matco business which achieved high-single digit growth during 2006 driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels. The retail mechanics’ hand tools business also
grew in the second half of 2006 compared to the second half of 2005 as sell-through at Sears, a major customer of the segment, improved from prior year levels. The business continues to experience growth with its other retail customers as well as
expanding markets for the business’ products in China. The segment’s niche businesses experienced mid-single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005 as strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses was partially offset by
weakness in the chuck business.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.4% in 2006 compared to 15.4% in 2005. Implementation of SFAS 123R in the
first quarter of 2006 reduced segment operating profit by approximately $6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, negatively impacting year-over-year operating margins by 45 basis points. The Company also incurred costs associated with exiting a small
product line during the second half of 2006 which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 30 basis points. Operating profit margins also declined during 2006 due to lower margin products accounting for a larger proportion of sales
within the segment as well as due to higher overall freight costs. Finally, year-over-year operating margin comparisons were negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points as a result of a $5.3 million ($3.9 million after taxes) gain on the
sale of real estate in 2005. The adverse impacts on operating margins described above were offset somewhat by the impact of leverage from higher sales levels, including the pricing actions implemented in 2006, as well as the benefit of restructuring
actions taken in 2005.

The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of the segment’s businesses and the Company’s low-cost
region sourcing and production initiatives are all expected to further improve segment operating margins in future periods. Certain regulatory requirements affecting the end markets served by the Company’s engine retarder business accelerated
customer purchases to 2006 which will adversely impact segment sales volumes in 2007.

2005 COMPARED TO 2004

Sales in the Tools & Components segment decreased 1.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2005 period sales were negatively impacted by 5.0% on a year-over-year basis
due to the sale of a small business in late 2004 for which previously reported sales have not been restated. Sales from existing businesses contributed approximately 4.0% growth for the segment in 2005, including approximately 2.0% growth due to
price increases that the Company implemented as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities. There were no acquisitions in this segment during 2004 or 2005 and currency impacts on sales were negligible in both periods.

Mechanics’ Hand Tools sales, representing approximately two-thirds of segment sales in 2005, grew approximately 4.0% in 2005, compared with 2004. The sales growth
was driven primarily by sales growth in the group’s high-end mobile tool distribution business which experienced low-double digit growth during the year driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels.
Mechanics’ Hand Tools also experienced significant growth in 2005 in the China market. The business’ retail mechanics’ hand tools business declined at low-single digit levels during 2005 compared with 2004. The integration of Sears
and Kmart, a major customer of the segment, tempered the business’ 2005 sales growth. The segment’s niche businesses also experienced mid-single digit growth during 2005 due primarily to strength in the truck box and engine retarder
businesses.

Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.4% in 2005 compared to 15.2% in 2004. The improvement in operating profit margins for 2005
primarily relates to the pricing initiatives implemented to offset a portion of the steel and other commodity cost increases experienced beginning in 2004; the impact of higher sales levels and the impact of Danaher Business System cost reduction
programs implemented in 2004 and 2005; and the impact of a gain recorded on the sale of real estate totaling $5.3 million ($3.9 million after taxes) during the first quarter of 2005. These improvements more than offset the incremental costs
associated with



closing one of the segment’s manufacturing facilities. The Company incurred approximately $11 million in costs associated with this plant closure in
2005, which provided minimal benefit to operating margins in 2005.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from leverage on increased sales volume,
the on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region initiatives, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, and cost reductions in recently
acquired business units. Increases in selling prices to offset some of the increases in cost and surcharges related to steel and other commodity purchases also contributed to gross profit improvement. These improvements were partially offset by a
change in mix to certain lower margin businesses including the Gilbarco Veeder-Root business and sales to the United States Postal Service in the product identification business. In addition, the Company recorded a loss on a product development
venture in the first quarter of 2006 and incurred higher initial product costs associated with the Sybron Dental acquisition in the second quarter of 2006, which further reduced gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2006. Higher raw
material costs or any significant slowdown in the economy could adversely affect gross profit margins in future periods.

Gross profit margins for 2005
improved 110 basis points to 43.1% from 42.0% in 2004. This improvement resulted primarily from generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, leverage on increased sales volume, on-going cost improvements in existing
business units driven by our DBS processes and low-cost region initiatives, and cost reductions in recently acquired business units. Partly offsetting these improvements were the costs associated with closing a manufacturing facility in the
Tools & Components segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

The year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is due primarily to increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses associated with recently acquired businesses (principally Leica, Sybron Dental and Vision) and their higher relative operating expense structures, additional spending to fund growth opportunities
throughout the Company, and the implementation of SFAS 123R. Implementation of SFAS 123R in 2006 increased operating expenses by $55 million in 2006 and contributed a 60 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, in 2006 the Company expensed approximately $6.5 million of in-process research and development related to the Vision acquisition. The Company also recorded a $4.5 million impairment of a
minority interest in a medical technologies company in the first quarter of 2006, which increased 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 5 basis points compared to 2005. These items were partially
offset by increased leverage from higher sales levels in 2006.



INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS

For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below.

Interest expense of $79.8 million in 2006 was approximately $34.9 million higher than 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2006 is primarily due to higher debt
levels during the year, primarily due to borrowings incurred to fund the acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision. Interest expense for 2005 was lower than the prior year by approximately $10.1 million. The decrease in interest expense in 2005
compared to 2004 was due primarily to lower debt levels during the year as a result of the repayment of the Company's 6.25% Eurobond notes and to a lesser extent, lower borrowing rates on new borrowings during the period.

Interest income of $8.0 million, $14.7 million and $7.6 million was recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Average invested cash balances decreased during 2006
compared to 2005 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, to finance repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock in the second half of 2005 and to repay the previously outstanding Eurobonds in
July 2005. In addition, 2005 interest income reflects the collection of $4.6 million of interest on a note receivable which had not previously been recorded due to collection risk (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information).

INCOME TAXES

The Company’s
effective tax rate of 22.4% for 2006 was 4.9 percentage points lower than the effective tax rate for 2005. The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2006 benefited by $69 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as a result of the reduction of
valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized, the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves
and the impact of a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. These positive impacts were partially mitigated by a higher effective tax rate applicable to the second
quarter 2006 gain on the sale of shares of First Technology, plc (see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) which increased the overall provision by $1.5 million compared to what would have been incurred using the Company’s
overall effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2007 is expected to be approximately 27%.

The 2005 effective tax rate of 27.3% was 2.2 percentage
points lower than the 2004 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company also resolved examinations of certain previously filed U.S. and international tax returns and
provided additional reserves for other matters arising during the third quarter of 2005. Resolution of these matters resulted in a small benefit from the reversal of previously provided tax reserves.

The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of
business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below) and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of
significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2006 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower
effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The
amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31,
2006, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States was approximately $3.4 billion.

The amount of income
taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and
accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary.
However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which the Company’s earnings
and/or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48)
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of
those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this
Interpretation and guidance on its application, the Company currently estimates the adoption of FIN 48 will reduce the amount recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions by approximately $60 to $80 million. This reduction will be
recorded as an increase to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007.



INFLATION

Inflation
did not significantly impact the Company’s overall results of operations in either 2006 or 2005. The Company has experienced cost increases during the past two years in the costs of steel and petroleum-based products, and with respect to the
past year, non-ferrous metals as well. The Company is passing along certain of these cost increases to customers.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK
MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact
its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact
that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.

Interest Rate Risk

The fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this
potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2006, the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt would decrease by approximately $35 million. This methodology
has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Company’s results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest
rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month
LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments
qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not
have significant commodity contracts or other derivatives.

Exchange Rate Risk

The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States
Dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when
European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. Dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Eurobond Notes described below, as well as the European component of the commercial paper program which as of
December 31, 2006, had outstanding borrowings equivalent to $1,446.9 million, provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position.

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk
consist of cash and temporary investments, interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company
anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high-quality financial
institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of
the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity

•

Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, increased $343.5 million, or approximately 28.5% as compared to 2005. Earnings growth contributed
$224.2 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005, and non-cash stock compensation expense and increases in depreciation and amortization also positively impacted cash flow. Non-cash reductions of previously provided tax
reserves positively impacted net earnings but adversely impacted the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. Operating working capital was a net source of cash flow in 2006 despite higher sales levels as overall operating
working capital turns improved from the levels experienced during 2005.

•

As of December 31, 2006, the Company held $317.8 million of cash and cash equivalents.

•

Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired 11 companies and product lines during 2006 for total
consideration of $2,656.0 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired.

•

Danaher financed the 2006 acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from
available cash. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $866.8 million in borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program of which $80 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and $786.8 million was denominated in Euros
(€596 million).

•

During the second quarter of 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility and a separate, unsecured $700 million
multicurrency revolving credit facility, both of which were available to backstop the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company terminated the $700 million facility on October 11, 2006, which has the practical effect of reducing from
$2.2 billion to $1.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program.

•

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued €500 million ($630 million) of 4.5%, guaranteed notes due July 22, 2013, with a
fixed re-offer price of 99.623 (the “Eurobond Notes”) in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of
underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were approximately €496 million ($627 million) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper used to finance the Sybron
Dental acquisition and for general corporate purposes.

Operating Activities

The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in
existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs, the timing of payments
for items such as income taxes, pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows.



Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, was approximately $1.5 billion for 2006, an increase
of $343.5 million, or approximately 28.5% as compared to 2005. Earnings growth contributed $224.2 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005. Included in earnings growth is a non-cash benefit of approximately $69 million
from the reduction of tax reserves and a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. Because this is a non-cash benefit to net earnings, it adversely impacts the
comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. The Company also recorded increased stock option expense of $55 million in 2006 as required by SFAS 123R – Share Based Payments. Because this expense adversely impacts net
earnings but does not require the use of cash, it positively impacts the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. Operating cash flows during 2006 also benefited from increases in non-cash depreciation and amortization
charges of approximately $40 million compared to 2005. These increases in depreciation and amortization primarily related to recent acquisitions. Operating working capital, which the Company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less
accounts payable, also contributed favorably to 2006 operating cash flow but at lower levels than in the comparable 2005 period, due primarily to less cash flow generation from accounts payable in 2006 compared to 2005.

In connection with its acquisitions, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating
the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition.

Investing Activities

Cash flows relating to investing activities
consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,769 million in 2006 compared to approximately $965 million in 2005. Gross
capital spending increased $16.5 million in 2006 from 2005 levels to $137.7 million, due primarily to capital spending relating to new acquisitions, and increased spending related to investments in the Company’s low-cost region sourcing
initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are made primarily to support product development, for increasing capacity, replacement of equipment and improving information technology systems.

Net cash used in investing activities was $965 million in 2005 compared to approximately $1.6 billion in 2004. Capital spending increased $5 million in 2005 from 2004
levels to $121 million. In 2007, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $175 to $200 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $10 million and $19 million of cash proceeds for 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2006, 2005 and 2004. All of the acquisitions during this period have
resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired
and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements.

2006 Acquisitions

In May 2006,
the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron Dental for total consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt.
Substantially all of the assumed debt was subsequently repaid or refinanced prior to December 31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial
paper, as discussed under “Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below, and to a lesser extent from available cash.

In addition, in the last
quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate price of approximately $520 million, including transaction costs and net of approximately $122 million of cash acquired and
assumed $1.5 million of debt. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical
reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of approximately $86 million in its last completed fiscal year. Management believes that the pairing of Vision with the Company’s existing life science
instrumentation business, Leica, will significantly broaden the Company’s product offerings in the growing anatomical pathology market and expand the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses.

Total consideration for the other nine businesses acquired during 2006 was approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In
general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental instrumentation, medical equipment or industrial products, in the market segments of electronic test, critical care diagnostics, water quality, product identification and sensors
and controls. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of either the Professional



Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these nine acquired businesses were approximately
$140 million at the dates of their respective acquisitions.

In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold shares of First
Technology plc, a U.K. - based public company, in connection with the Company’s unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break-up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second quarter of 2006
the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after-tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in “other expense
(income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings.

Disposals of fixed assets and land yielded approximately $10 million
of cash proceeds during 2006 due to the sale of three parcels of real estate and miscellaneous equipment. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $19 million of cash proceeds during 2005,primarily related to a sale of a building which
generated a pre-tax gain $5.3 million in 2005 which was included as a component of “other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

2005 Acquisitions

In the first quarter of 2005 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing
Technologies PLC, a publicly-held U.K based coding and marking business, for $171 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of $2 million. Linx complements the Company’s product identification businesses and had
annual revenue of approximately $93 million in 2004.

In August 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of German-based Leica Microsystems
AG, for an aggregate purchase price of €210 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of €12 million and the assumption and repayment at closing of €125 million outstanding Leica debt ($429
million in aggregate as of the date of the acquisition). The Company funded this acquisition and the repayment of debt assumed using available cash and through borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit totaling $222 million, which have
subsequently been repaid. Leica complements the Company’s medical technologies business and had annual revenues of approximately $540 million in 2004 (excluding the approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor
business that has been divested, as described below).

In September 2005, the Company also completed the sale of Leica’s semiconductor equipment
business which was held for sale at the time of the acquisition. This business had historically operated at a loss. Proceeds from the sale have been reflected as a reduction in the purchase price for Leica in the accompanying Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. Operating losses for this business for the period from acquisition to disposition totaled approximately $1.3 million and are reflected in “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

In addition to Linx and Leica, the Company acquired 11 smaller companies and product lines during 2005 for total consideration of $285 million in cash,
including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, electronic test, sensors and controls,
environmental, product identification, aerospace and defense and motion. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of either the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The
aggregated annual sales of these 11 acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions were approximately $260 million.

In June 2005, the
Company divested one insignificant business that was reported as a continuing operation within the Industrial Technologies segment for aggregate proceeds of $12.1 million in cash net of related transaction expenses. Sales related to this business
included in the Company’s results for 2005 were $7.5 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $4.6 million on the divestiture which is reported as a component of “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. Net cash proceeds received on the sale are included in “Proceeds from Divestitures” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

In June 2005, the Company collected $14.6 million in full payment of a retained interest that was in the form of a $10 million note receivable and an equity interest arising from the sale of a prior business. The
Company had recorded this note net of applicable allowances and had not previously recognized interest income on the note due to uncertainties associated with collection of the principal balance of the note and the related interest. As a result of
the collection, the Company recorded $4.6 million of interest income related to the cumulative interest received on this note in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.3 million related to collection of
the note balance in the second quarter of 2005 which has been recorded as a component of “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Cash proceeds from the collection of the principal balance of
$10 million are included in “Proceeds from Divestitures” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.



2004 Acquisitions

In
January 2004, the Company acquired all of the share capital of Radiometer S/A for $684 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs. In addition, the Company assumed $66 million of debt in connection with
the acquisition. Radiometer had total annual sales of approximately $300 million at the time of acquisition.

In May 2004, the Company acquired all of
the outstanding shares of Kaltenbach & Voight Gmbh (KaVo) for €350 million ($412 million) in cash, including transaction costs and net of $45 million in acquired cash. KaVo, headquartered in Biberach, Germany, with 2003
revenues of approximately $450 million, is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of dental technology, including hand pieces, treatment units and diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment.

In November 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Trojan Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of $185 million in cash, including
transaction costs and net of $23 million in acquired cash. In addition, the Company assumed $4 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Trojan is a leader in the ultraviolet disinfection market for drinking and wastewater applications and
had annual revenues of approximately $115 million at the time of acquisition.

In addition to Radiometer, KaVo and Trojan, the Company acquired ten smaller
companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of $311 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in markets such as
medical technologies, electronic test, motion, environmental, product identification, sensors and controls, and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses within the Professional Instrumentation
segment, or in connection with the establishment of the Medical Technologies segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective dates of acquisition were approximately $280 million.

In addition, the Company sold a business that was part of the Tools & Components segment during 2004. This business was insignificant to reported sales and
earnings. Proceeds from this sale have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The pre-tax gain on the sale of $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) is included in “Other expense
(income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Recent Acquisition Developments

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of five smaller companies and product lines for total consideration of $206 million in cash,
including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses. Two of the businesses are manufacturers of dental imaging products and will be part of the Company’s Medical
Technologies segment. The other businesses complement the Company’s electronic test and environmental businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective
dates of acquisition were approximately $91 million.

Financing Activities and Indebtedness

Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing
activities provided cash of $1,219 million during 2006 compared to $512 million of cash used during the comparable period of 2005. The increase in cash generated from financing activities was primarily due to commercial paper borrowings used to
finance the acquisition of Sybron Dental and Vision, and the issuance of $627 million (€496 million) private placement Eurobond Notes, net of debt repayments and dividends paid during 2006. Proceeds from the Eurobond Notes were used to pay off
a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes.

Total debt was $2,434 million at December 31, 2006 compared
to $1,042 million at December 31, 2005. The Company’s debt financing as of December 31, 2006 was comprised primarily of:

•

$787 million of outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper;

•

$80 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper;

•

$660 million (€500 million) 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due July 22, 2013;

•

$594 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”);

•

$250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above); and

•

$63 million of other borrowings.

The Company
primarily satisfies its short-term liquidity needs through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Company’s U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or its subsidiary may issue and sell unsecured, short-term
promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.2 billion. The Company issued $2 billion of commercial paper in May 2006 and used the proceeds principally to fund its acquisition of Sybron Dental. Subsequent to May 2006, the Company
has used available cash flow and the proceeds from the Eurobond Note offering (see below) to reduce outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs. In November and December 2006, the Company again utilized its commercial paper program to
fund the acquisition of Vision. As of December 31, 2006, $80 million remained outstanding under the U.S. dollar commercial paper program with an average interest rate of 5.34% and an average maturity of 3 days and $787 million remained
outstanding under the Euro-denominated commercial paper program (€596 million) with an average interest rate of 3.87% and an average maturity of 64 days.



Credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit
facility (the “Credit Facility”) which the Company entered into in April 2006 to replace two existing $500 million credit facilities. The Credit Facility expires on April 25, 2011, subject to a one-year extension option at the request
of Danaher and with the consent of the lenders. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula, (2) a formula based on the lender’s
prime rate or on the Federal funds rate, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the Credit Facility. In May 2006 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured $700 million
multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Secondary Credit Facility”) on terms substantially similar to those under the Credit Facility that was also available to provide credit support for the Company’s commercial paper and for
working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company terminated the Secondary Credit Facility on October 11, 2006, which has the practical effect of reducing from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper
that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program. The Company terminated the Secondary Credit Facility because Company management believes that the $1.5 billion facility provides sufficient backstop for amounts that the Company believes
will be issued under the commercial paper facility in the foreseeable future, that additional credit would be available if the Company were to decide to issue more than $1.5 billion of commercial paper or otherwise need additional credit, and that
termination of the $700 million facility eliminates unnecessary fees. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Secondary Credit Facility, or either of the terminated credit facilities, during 2006.

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond
Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million) and have been used to pay down a
portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at
maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity
of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher
common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was $49 per share, which, at that date, was lower than the traded market value of the
underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may offer to redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at
the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being
redeemed by the Company for cash.

Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month
period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The
amount of contingent interest to be paid is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% percent of the bonds’ market value measured by its five day trading average price preceeding the record date or the equivalent common stock dividend. Contingent
interest of approximately $0.5 million is payable for the six month period from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company borrowed $120 million under uncommitted lines of credit in connection with the investment in the shares of
First Technology noted above and other matters. These borrowings, along with all borrowings incurred in 2005 under uncommitted lines of credit associated with the purchase of Leica, which totaled $177 million as of December 31, 2005, were fully
repaid in the first quarter of 2006.

The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 were issued in October 1998 at an interest cost of 6.1%. The fair value of
the 2008 notes, after taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed below, is approximately $252 million at December 31, 2006. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the notes having
an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes is the six-month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. Rates are reset twice per year. At December 31, 2006, the net
interest rate on $100 million of the notes was 5.8% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 (“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended), the Company
accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges.

On
April 21, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no
expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may
be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s 1998 Stock Option Plan (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes.



During 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of Company common stock in open market
transactions at an aggregate cost of $257.7 million. The repurchases were funded from available cash and from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit. There were no share repurchases under this program in 2006 and at December 31, 2006, the
Company had approximately 5 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or existing lines of credit.

The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. However, a downgrade
in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Company’s ability to
issue commercial paper. The Company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are
considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

To
benefit from the SEC Securities Offering Reform rules applicable to well-known seasoned issuers, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in July 2006, which became effective automatically, to register an
indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. No securities have been issued off this shelf registration statement. The new registration
statement replaced the Company’s prior, $1 billion shelf registration statement.

The Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share
payable on January 26, 2007 to holders of record on December 29, 2006. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2006 were $24.6 million.

Cash and Cash Requirements

As of December 31, 2006, the Company held $318 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in
highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less.

The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working
capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company generally intends to
use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, using borrowings under existing commercial paper programs or credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets as needed for liquidity. The Company believes that
it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both short-term and long-term requirements.

The Company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous
locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in
which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and inter-company financing is used to provide working capital to our operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United
States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient
inter-company transfer of funds, the Company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.

Pension and Other Post Retirement & Employee Benefit Plans

Due to previous equity market declines the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the U.S. plan. In addition, certain non-U.S. plans are not
fully funded. As a result, in accordance with SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”, the Company has
recorded unrecognized losses and prior service costs of $151.9 million ($99.2 million net of tax benefits) cumulatively through December 31, 2006. The unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the
actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2006. This adjustment results in a direct reduction of stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158

, “

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). For a summary of the material provisions of SFAS No. 158, see “New Accounting Standards.” The application of FAS 158 in 2006 decreased the
Company’s minimum pension liability by $13.0 million ($9.1 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Company’s non-US pension plans. The Company also recorded
other comprehensive income of $10 million ($6.5 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Company’s U.S. based retiree benefit program.

Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions
include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend



rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement
benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. For the United States plan, the Company used a 5.75%
discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2006, which represents an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate from December 31, 2005. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for
each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased
the minimum pension liability $20 million ($13 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2006.

For 2006, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8.0% which is the same as the rate used in 2005. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation
of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan invests between 60% to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad
market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $17 million (or $11 million on an
after-tax basis), compared with $8.1 million (or $5.9 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2005. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2006 would have increased $1.6 million
(or $1.0 million on an after-tax basis). The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plan in 2006 and is not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2007. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various
insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and
ranged from 2.5% to 6.5% for 2006.

The U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted August 17, 2006. While the Act will have some effect on
specific plan provisions in our retirement program, its primary effect will be to change the minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2008. Based on initial projections, the Act is expected to slightly increase the amount of our
required contributions.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The
following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases,
(3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP.

(a)

As described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(b)

Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.



(c)

As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(d)

Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

(e)

Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs,
self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s
estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of
the Company.

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations
under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers and
financing entities.

In connection with three past acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts
in the future as additional purchase price. The Company enters into these types of arrangements to help bridge differences of opinion that the Company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business. The Company could
pay nothing in the aggregate over the next three years pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $41.9 million over the next three years depending on the future performance of the respective businesses. In connection with acquisitions
completed subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company entered into similar agreements with the respective sellers to pay additional purchase price of up to $2.4 million over the next 2 years if certain performance criteria are achieved.

The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides
representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or
tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these
representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Due to the Company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties
vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.



Except as described above, as of December 31, 2006 the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements and has no unconsolidated special purpose entities.

Legal Proceedings

Please refer to Notes 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain outstanding litigation matters.

In addition to the litigation noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety”, the Company is, from
time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims
involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages.
While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection
with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to
indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. The Company believes that the results of these litigation matters and other
pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on its cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance or indemnification recoveries.

The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Company carries
significant deductibles and self-insured retentions under our insurance policies, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management determines the Company’s accrual for
self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.

The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation
requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving
at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability
could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.

For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer
to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion
on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounts receivable

.
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on
historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of
the Company’s customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which could adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition.

Inventories

. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future
demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the
value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition.



Acquired intangibles

. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible
assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, the accounting
standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists.
Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business
plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If
actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess
of fair value over carrying value for each of the Company’s reporting units as of September 30, 2006, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $3 million to approximately $1.7 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the
fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from
approximately $1 million to approximately $1.5 billion for each of the Company’s reporting units.

Long-lived assets

. The Company reviews its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the
assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value.
Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing
maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of
long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the
balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.

Purchase accounting

. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company
formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”, the Company
accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date
as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Company’s experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired
company’s business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the
uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to
incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing
recorded goodwill balances.

Risk Insurance

.

The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions with respect to
various business risks. The business risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability. For domestic workers’ compensation and product liability risk, the Company generally
purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. These reserves are comprised of specific reserves for
individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists for
workers’ compensation and by outside risk insurance experts for product liability. In addition, outside risk experts recommend reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims by evaluating the Company’s specific loss history, actual
claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2006 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it
is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.

Environmental.

The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and
environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental
studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation
and remediation costs, associated with the site. The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While the Company actively
pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible



parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is
difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Company’s involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of
applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Contingent Liabilities.

The Company is, from time to time, subject to routine
litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation, and litigation and
administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
damages. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential
amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the
anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new
developments or changes in the Company’s settlement strategy. For a discussion of these contingencies, including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, refer to Note 11 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” This statement
requires a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability for a plan’s under funded status (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that
determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The
requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of
the date of the employer’s fiscal year–end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard reduced the amount of pension and other post-retirement liabilities
recorded by approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2006 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Company’s non-US pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined
prior service credits associated with the Company’s U.S. based retiree benefit program. The Company expects to change its pension plan measurement date to December 31 effective in 2008. See “Pension and Other Post
Retirement & Employee Benefit Plans” above and Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin
(“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires
that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 was effective in the Company’s first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a
significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
statements of financial accounting standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (“SFAS 123 R”), which requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards. See Note 14 for
further discussion.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes –
an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this Interpretation and guidance on its application, the Company
currently estimates the adoption of FIN 48 will reduce the amount recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions by approximately $60 to $80 million. This reduction will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of
January 1, 2007.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Management on Danaher Corporation’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. This report dated February 21, 2007 appears on page 46 of this Form 10-K.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Danaher Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Danaher Corporation’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Danaher Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Danaher Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Danaher Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Danaher Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 and our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Danaher Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, and adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post
Retirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132R.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Danaher Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Business

—Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial and consumer products which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions in
four business segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components. Businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products
and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. As of December 31, 2006, the Professional Instrumentation segment encompassed two strategic businesses - environmental and electronic test. These businesses produce
and sell compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; and retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including underground storage
tank leak detection and vapor recovery systems. The Medical Technologies segment includes businesses that design and manufacture critical care diagnostic instruments, high-precision optical systems for the analysis of microstructures and a wide
range of products used by dental professionals. Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines and by
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products and systems. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime.
The Industrial Technologies segment encompassed two strategic businesses, motion and product identification, and three focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, sensors & controls, and power quality. These businesses produce and sell
product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; aerospace safety
devices and defense articles; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand
tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; and drill chucks.

Accounting Principles

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon
consolidation.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Inventory Valuation

—Inventories
include the costs of material, labor and overhead. Depending on the business, domestic inventories are stated at either the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO) or the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories held outside the United States are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the FIFO method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. The provision for depreciation has been computed principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives (3 to 35 years) of the
depreciable assets.

Other Assets

—Other assets include principally noncurrent trade receivables, other investments, and capitalized costs
associated with obtaining financings which are amortized over the term of the related debt.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

—For cash and
equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. For long-term debt, where quoted market prices are not available, rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of
existing debt.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—Goodwill and other intangible assets result from the Company’s acquisition of
existing businesses. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, amortization of recorded goodwill balances ceased effective January 1, 2002. However, amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets
continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset. Amortization expense for all other intangible assets, including a charge of $6.5 million in 2006 related to acquired in-process research and development at an acquired business, was
$64.2 million, $36.0 million and $26.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. See Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Shipping and Handling

—Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales.

Revenue Recognition

—As described above, the Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of professional, industrial, medical and consumer products and
services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and
determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Company’s standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sale upon shipment. If any significant
obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and



acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for
products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale as required by SFAS No. 48. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are recorded
as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased in accordance with EITF 01-9. Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based
on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement as required by FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1.

Research and Development

—The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $446 million, $379 million, and $294 million in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

—Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in net earnings, whereas adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are
reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are not material in any of the years presented.

Cash and Equivalents

—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.

Income Taxes

—The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are summarized below. Foreign
currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite investments in non-US subsidiaries.

See Notes 8 and 9 for additional information.

Accounting for Stock Options

—As described in Note 14, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment
(“SFAS 123R”), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), based on the fair market value of the award
as of the grant date. SFAS 123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB
25”). The Company has adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the
unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimated forfeiture rates for 2006 based on its historical experience. Stock-based compensation for 2006 of $67.2
million has been recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as payroll costs of the employees are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that
compensation cost be recognized for the Company’s stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Under APB 25, the Company was required to record expense over
the vesting period for the value of RSUs granted. Compensation expense related to RSU awards is calculated based on the market prices of Company common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure



amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” (SFAS No. 148), as if the
fair value method defined by SFAS No. 123 had been applied to its stock-based compensation.

The estimated fair value of the options granted during
2006, 2005, and 2004 was calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model (Black-Scholes) and assuming risk-free interest rates between 4.0% to 5.1%, an option life ranging from 7.0 to 9.5 years, expected volatility ranging from 22% to
25% and dividends at the current annual rate.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the fair
value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each year ($ thousands, except per share amounts):

Pension & Post Retirement Benefit Plans

—On September 29, 2006, SFAS No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” was issued. SFAS No. 158 requires, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan, retiree health
care and other postretirement benefit plans and post-employment benefit plans on the balance sheet. The Company adopted SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. See notes 8 & 9 for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements

—See Note 17.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES:

The Company has completed numerous
acquisitions of businesses during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These acquisitions have either been completed because of their strategic fit with an existing Company business or because they are of such a nature and size as
to establish a new strategic line of business for growth for the Company. All of the acquisitions during this time period have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial
statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which
similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and because of the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing
operations.

The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair market value
of the acquired assets and liabilities. The Company obtains this information during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about these assets and liabilities and learns
more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair market value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to refine the allocations include: tangible
and intangible asset appraisals; cost data related to redundant facilities; employee/personnel data related to redundant functions; product line integration and rationalization information; management capabilities; and information systems
compatibilities. The only items considered for subsequent adjustment are items identified as of the acquisition date. The Company’s acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 did not have any significant pre-acquisition contingencies (as contemplated by
SFAS No. 38, “Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises”) which were expected to have a significant effect on the purchase price allocation. The Company is continuing to evaluate certain pre-acquisition
contingencies associated with ongoing litigation associated with its 2006 acquisitions,



primarily Sybron Dental and Vision, and will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the one-year anniversary of the
acquisition, as required.

The Company also periodically disposes of existing operations that are not deemed to strategically fit with its ongoing
operations or are not achieving the desired return on investment. The following briefly describes the Company’s acquisition and divestiture activity for the above-noted periods.

In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron Dental for total consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of approximately $94 million of cash acquired,
and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Substantially all of the assumed debt was subsequently repaid or refinanced prior to December 31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily
with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. The Sybron acquisition resulted in the recognition of a preliminary estimate of goodwill of approximately $1.5 billion primarily related to Sybron’s
future earnings and cash flow potential and the world-wide leadership position of Sybron in many of its served markets. Sybron has been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings since May 19, 2006.

In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate price of approximately
$520 million, including transaction costs and net of approximately $122 million of cash acquired, and assumed $1.5 million of debt. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper.
Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of approximately $86 million in its last completed
fiscal year. The Vision acquisition resulted in the recognition of a preliminary estimate of goodwill of approximately $357 million, primarily related to Vision’s future revenue growth and earnings potential. Vision’s results of operations
have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings since November 30, 2006 and were not material to reported sales. The Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $6.5 million for acquired in-process research and development
in connection with this acquisition which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.

In addition to Sybron Dental and Vision, the Company acquired nine
other companies and product lines in 2006 for total consideration of approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs, net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental instrumentation,
medical equipment or industrial products, in markets such as electronic test, critical care diagnostics, water quality, product identification, and sensors and controls. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the
Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $130 million of goodwill related to these acquired businesses. The aggregated annual sales of these nine acquired businesses
at the dates of their respective acquisitions were approximately $140 million.

In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold
shares of First Technology plc, a U.K - based public company, in connection with the Company’s unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break-up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second
quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after-tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in “Other
expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Disposals of fixed assets and land yielded approximately $10 million
of cash proceeds during 2006 from the sale of three parcels of real estate and miscellaneous equipment. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $19 million of cash proceeds during 2005 primarily related to a sale of a building which
generated a pre-tax gain $5.3 million in 2005 which was included as a component of “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of five smaller companies and product lines for total consideration of $206 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash
acquired. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses. Two of the businesses are manufacturers of dental imaging products and will be part of the Company’s Medical Technologies segment. The other businesses
complement the Company’s electronic test and environmental businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective dates of acquisition were approximately $91
million.

In the first quarter of 2005 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a publicly-held U.K. based
coding and marking business, for $171 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of $2 million. Linx complements the Company’s product identification businesses and had annual revenue of approximately $93 million in
2004. This acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $96 million, primarily related to the future earnings and cash flow potential of Linx and its synergies with the Company’s existing operations. Linx has been included in the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings since January 3, 2005.

In August 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
German-based Leica Microsystems AG, for an aggregate purchase price of €210 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of €12 million and the assumption and repayment at closing of
€125 million outstanding Leica debt ($429 million in aggregate as of the date of the acquisition). The Company funded this acquisition and the repayment of debt assumed using available cash and through borrowings under uncommitted



lines of credit totaling $222 million, which have subsequently been repaid. Leica complements the Company’s medical technologies business and had annual
revenues of approximately $540 million in 2004 (excluding the approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor business that has been divested, as described below). The Leica acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill
of $332 million primarily related to Leica’s future earnings and cash flow potential and world-wide leadership position of Leica in its served markets. Leica has been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since
August 31, 2005.

In September 2005, the Company also completed the sale of Leica’s semiconductor equipment business which was held for sale at
the time of the acquisition. This business had historically operated at a loss. Proceeds from the sale have been reflected as a reduction in the purchase price for Leica in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating losses for
this business for the period from acquisition to disposition totaled approximately $1.3 million and are reflected in “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In addition to Linx and Leica, the Company acquired 11 smaller companies and product lines during 2005 for total consideration of $285 million in cash, including
transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, electronic test, motion, environmental, product
identification, sensors and controls and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The Company recorded an
aggregate of $222 million of goodwill related to these acquired businesses. The aggregate annual sales of these 11 acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions were approximately $260 million.

In June 2005, the Company divested one insignificant business that was reported as a continuing operation within the Industrial Technologies segment for aggregate
proceeds of $12.1 million in cash net of related transaction expenses. Sales related to this divested business included in the Company’s results for 2005 were $7.5 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $4.6 million on the divestiture
which is reported as a component of “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Net cash proceeds received on the sale are included in “Proceeds from Divestitures” in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In June 2005, the Company collected $14.6 million in full payment of a retained interest that was in the form of a
$10 million note receivable and an equity interest arising from the sale of a prior business. The Company had recorded this note net of applicable allowances and had not previously recognized interest income on the note due to uncertainties
associated with collection of the principal balance of the note and the related interest. As a result of the collection, during the second quarter of 2005 the Company recorded $4.6 million of interest income related to the cumulative interest
received on this note. In addition, during the second quarter of 2005 the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.3 million related to collection of the note balance which has been recorded as a component of “Other expense (income), net” in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cash proceeds from the collection of the principal balance of $10 million are included in “Proceeds from Divestitures” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In January 2004, the Company acquired all of the share capital of Radiometer S/A for $684 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including
transaction costs. In addition, the Company assumed $66 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Radiometer designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of blood gas diagnostic instrumentation, primarily in hospital applications.
Radiometer also provides consumables and services for its instruments. This acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $445 million primarily related to the anticipated future earnings and cash flow potential and worldwide leadership
position of Radiometer in critical care diagnostic instrumentation. Radiometer is a worldwide leader in its served segments, and had total annual sales of approximately $300 million at the time of acquisition. The results of Radiometer have been
included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since January 22, 2004.

In May 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Kaltenbach & Voigt GmbH (KaVo) for €350 million ($412 million) in cash, including transaction costs and net of $45 million in acquired cash. KaVo, headquartered in Biberach, Germany, with 2003 revenues of approximately
$450 million, is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of dental technology, including hand pieces, treatment units and diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment. This acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $82
million primarily related to the anticipated future earnings of KaVo and its leadership position in dental instrumentation. The results of KaVo have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since May 28, 2004.

In November 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Trojan Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of $185 million in cash,
including transaction costs and net of $23 million in acquired cash. In addition, the Company assumed $4 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. This acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $117 million primarily related
to the anticipated future earnings. The acquisition is being included in the Company’s Professional Instrumentation segment in the environmental business. Trojan is a leader in the ultraviolet disinfection market for drinking and wastewater
applications and had annual revenues of approximately $115 million at the time of acquisition. The results of Trojan have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since November 8, 2004.



In addition to Radiometer, KaVo, and Trojan, the Company acquired ten smaller companies and product lines during 2004 for
total consideration of $311 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, electronic test,
motion, environmental, product identification, sensors and controls and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement businesses within the Professional Instrumentation segment or in connection with the establishment of the
Medical Technologies segment. The Company recorded an aggregate of $182 million of goodwill related to these acquired businesses. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses as of the respective dates of acquisition were approximately
$280 million.

In addition, the Company sold a business that was part of the Tools & Components segment during 2004 for approximately $43 million
in cash and the proceeds have been included in “Proceeds from Divestitures” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. A gain of approximately $1.5 million ($1.1 million net of tax) was recognized and has been included in
“Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions consummated during 2006, 2005, and 2004 and the individually significant acquisitions discussed above (in thousands):

In connection with its acquisitions, the Company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration
of the acquired entity. This process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within 12 months of the acquisition. The Company accrues estimates for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or
restructurings, anticipated at the date of acquisition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” Adjustments to these
estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, reducing recorded goodwill
balances. Costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred. The Company is still finalizing its restructuring plans with respect to certain of its 2006 acquisitions, including Sybron Dental and Vision, and will adjust
current accrual levels to reflect such restructuring plans as such plans are finalized.



Accrued liabilities associated with these exit activities include the following (in thousands, except headcount):



In 2004, the adjustments to previously provided reserves related to the establishment of severance and facility closure
reserves for acquisitions which occurred in late 2003 and for which plans for integrating the businesses were not finalized until 2004. The 2005 adjustments to previously provided reserves for KaVo reflect finalization of the restructuring plans for
this business and include costs and headcount reductions associated with the planned sale of certain operations in lieu of closure. All adjustments to the previously provided reserves resulted in adjustments to Goodwill in accordance with EITF 95-3.
Involuntary employee termination benefits are presented as a component of the Company’s compensation and benefits accrual included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Facility closure and restructuring costs are reflected in
other accrued expenses (See Note 6).

INVENTORY:

The major classes of inventory are summarized as
follows ($ in thousands):

If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method had been used for inventories valued at LIFO cost, such inventories would
have been $11.4 million and $9.4 million higher at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:

The major classes
of property, plant and equipment are summarized as follows ($ in thousands):

(5)

GOODWILL:

As discussed in Note 2, goodwill arises from the excess
of the purchase price for acquired businesses exceeding the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired. Management assesses goodwill for impairment for each of its reporting units at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter
or as “triggering” events occur. In making its assessment of goodwill impairment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions
and market place data. The Company’s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarters of 2006, 2005 and 2004 and no impairment was identified. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment
in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment which may affect the carrying value of goodwill.

The following table shows the rollforward of
goodwill reflected in the financial statements resulting from the Company’s acquisition activities for 2004, 2005, and 2006 ($ in millions).



The Company recorded a net decrease in goodwill in 2006 primarily attributable to deferred taxes associated with
the finalization of purchase price allocations associated with 2005 acquisitions. The carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2006 for the Tools & Components segment, Medical Technologies segment, Professional Instrumentation
segment and Industrial Technologies segment were approximately $194 million, $2,924 million $1,455 million and $2,023 million, respectively. The carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2005 for the Tools & Components segment,
Medical Technologies segment, Professional Instrumentation segment and Industrial Technologies segment was approximately $194 million, $960 million, $1,348 million and $1,973 million, respectively. The carrying value of goodwill at December 31,
2004 for the Tools & Components segment, Medical Technologies segment, Professional Instrumentation segment and Industrial Technologies segment was approximately $194 million, $624 million, $1,224 million and $1,928 million, respectively.

(6) ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES:

Accrued
expenses and other liabilities include the following ($ in thousands):

Approximately $166 million of accrued expenses and other liabilities were guaranteed by standby letters of credit
and performance bonds as of December 31, 2006. The increase in non-current compensation and benefit accruals primarily relates to pension obligations assumed for businesses acquired in 2006, primarily Sybron Dental (refer to Note 8 for
additional information). Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Company’s income tax obligations.

(7) FINANCING:

Financing as of December 31, 2006 consisted of the following ($ in thousands):



The Notes due 2008 were issued in October 1998 at an interest cost of 6.1%. The fair value of the 2008 Notes, after
taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed below, is approximately $252 million at December 31, 2006. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal
amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes is the six-month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. Rates are reset twice per year.
At December 31, 2006, the net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes was 5.8% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 (“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, as amended), the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges.

In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for
general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock
(in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was $49
per share, which, at that date, was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may offer to redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to
purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of
January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.

The Company will pay
contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue
price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% percent of the bonds’ market value measured by its five day trading average price preceeding the
record date or the equivalent common stock dividend. Contingent interest payable for the six month period from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 is approximately $0.5 million. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company
will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.

The Company primarily satisfies its short-term liquidity needs through issuances of U.S. dollar and
Euro commercial paper. Under the Company’s U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or its subsidiary may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.2 billion. The Company
issued $2 billion of commercial paper in May 2006 and used the proceeds principally to fund its acquisition of Sybron Dental. Subsequent to May 2006, the Company has used available cash flow and the proceeds from the Eurobond Note offering (see
below) to reduce outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs. In November and December 2006, the Company again utilized its commercial paper program to fund the acquisition of Vision. As of December 31, 2006, $80 million remained
outstanding under the U.S. dollar commercial paper program with an average interest rate of 5.34% and an average maturity of 3 days and $787 million remained outstanding under the Euro-denominated commercial paper program (€596 million) with an
average interest rate of 3.87% and an average maturity of 64 days.

Credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by an unsecured $1.5
billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which the Company entered into in April 2006 to replace two existing $500 million credit facilities. The Credit Facility expires on April 25, 2011, subject to a
one-year extension option at the request of Danaher and with the consent of the lenders. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula,
(2) a formula based on the lender’s prime rate or on the Federal funds rate, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the Credit Facility. In May 2006 the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into an unsecured $700 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Secondary Credit Facility”) on terms substantially similar to those under the Credit Facility that was also available to provide credit
support for the Company’s commercial paper and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company terminated the Secondary Credit Facility on October 11, 2006, which has the practical effect of reducing from $2.2 billion
to $1.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the commercial paper program. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Secondary Credit Facility, or either of the terminated credit
facilities, during 2006.

The Company has classified $867 million of borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the above mentioned Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company borrowed $120 million under uncommitted lines of credit in connection with the investment in the shares of First
Technology noted above and other matters. These borrowings, along with all borrowings incurred in 2005 under uncommitted lines of credit associated with the purchase of Leica, which totaled $177 million as of December 31, 2005, were fully
repaid in the first quarter of 2006.

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued €500 million ($630 million) of 4.5%
guaranteed notes due July 22, 2013, with a fixed re-offer price of 99.623 (the “Eurobond Notes”) in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under



these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The fair value of the Eurobond notes is approximately $659 million at December 31, 2006. The net
proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial
paper and for general corporate purposes. The Eurobond notes, as well as the European component of the commercial paper program which, as of December 31, 2006, had outstanding borrowings equivalent to $1,446.9 million, provides a natural hedge
to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position.

The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity
of a material amount of outstanding debt. However, a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and credit facilities and could limit, or in the case of a
significant downgrade, preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. The Company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The minimum principal payments during the next five years are as follows: 2007 - $11 million; 2008 - $258 million; 2009 - $5 million; 2010 - $9 million, 2011 -
$878 million and $1,272 million thereafter.

The Company made interest payments of $48 million, $43 million and, $46 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

(8) PENSION BENEFIT PLANS:

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of its pension and other postretirement
plans in the December 31, 2006 statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net
unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs, and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 87, all of which were previously netted against the plan’s funded status in the
Company’s statement of financial position pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the Company’s historical accounting policy for amortizing such
amounts. Further, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will be subsequently
recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption of SFAS No. 158.

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s statement of financial position at December 31, 2006 are presented in the following table for pension benefit plans
(see Note 9 regarding Other Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans). The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no effect on the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006, or for any prior period
presented, and it will not affect the Company’s operating results in future periods. Had the Company not been required to adopt SFAS No. 158 at December 31, 2006, it would have recognized an additional minimum pension liability
pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. The effect of recognizing the additional minimum liability is included in the table below in the column labeled “Prior to Adopting SFAS No. 158.”



Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 are the following amounts that have
not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credits of $2.4 million ($1.7 million, net of tax) and unrecognized actuarial losses of $164.3 million ($107.4 million, net of tax). The prior service credits and
actuarial loss included in accumulated comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension costs during the year ending December 31, 2007 is $0.2 million ($0.1 million, net of tax) and $1.3 million ($0.9 million, net of
tax), respectively. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during the year ending December 31, 2007.

Due to previous equity market
declines, the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the U.S. plan. In addition, certain non-U.S. plans are not fully funded. As a result, in accordance
with SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”, the Company has recorded unrecognized losses and prior
service costs of $161.9 million ($105.7 million net of tax benefits) cumulatively through December 31, 2006. The unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined projected
benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets less accrued pension costs as of September 30, 2006. This adjustment results in a direct reduction of stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings.

The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which cover certain of its domestic employees. Benefit accruals under most of these plans have ceased.
It is the Company’s policy to fund, at a minimum, amounts required by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company acquired Leica Microsystems in August 2005, including its pension plans. The Company acquired Sybron Dental in May 2006, including
its pension plans. The following sets forth the funded status of the U.S. and non-U.S. plans as of the most recent actuarial valuations using a measurement date of September 30 ($ in millions):



The combined underfunded status of the U.S. and Non-U.S. pension plans of $324.2 million at December 31, 2006
is recognized in the accompanying statement of financial position as long-term accrued pension liability.

Selection of Expected Rate of Return on Assets

For 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company used an expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.0%, 8.0% and, 8.5%, respectively, for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company intends on using
an expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.0% for 2007 for its U.S. plan. The expected long-term rate of return assumption for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the composition of assets and ranged from
2.5% to 6.5% in 2006.

Investment Policy

The US
plan’s goal is to maintain between 60% to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. Asset holdings are periodically rebalanced when equity
holdings are outside this range. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Non-U.S. plan assets are invested in various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator
of each plan.

Expected Contributions

While not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2005 or 2006, the Company contributed $10 million to the U.S. plans in December 2005. The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plans and $25 million to the non-U.S.
plans in 2006. The Company is not required to and has no plans to make contributions to the U.S. plans in 2007. The Company expects to contribute approximately $22 million to the non-U.S. plans in 2007.

The following table sets forth, in millions of dollars, benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, expected to be paid in the periods
indicated.

Other Matters

Substantially all employees not covered by defined benefit plans are covered by defined contribution plans, which generally provide funding based on a percentage of compensation.

Pension expense for all plans amounted to $88.0 million, $66.4 million and, $63.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

OTHER POST RETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

In addition to
providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for some of its retired employees in the United States. Certain employees may become eligible for these benefits as they reach normal retirement age
while working for the Company. The following sets forth the funded status of the domestic plans as of the most recent actuarial valuations using a measurement date of September 30 ($ in millions):



At December 31, 2006, $99.5 million of the total underfunded status of the plan was recognized as long-term
accrued post retirement liability since it is not expected to be funded within one year. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during the fiscal year-ending December 31, 2007.

The medical trend rate used to determine the post retirement benefit obligation was 9% for 2006. The rate
decreases gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% in 2011, and remains at that level thereafter. The trend is a significant factor in determining the amounts reported.

The following table sets forth, in million of dollars, benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, expected to be paid in the periods indicated.

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 158 on the Company's statement of financial
position at December 31, 2006 are presented in the following table for other post-retirement employee benefit plans:

Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 are the following amounts that have
not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credits of $45.0 million ($29.3 million, net of tax) and unrecognized actuarial losses of $35.0 million ($22.8 million, net of tax). The prior service cost and
actuarial loss included in accumulated comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension costs during the year ending December 31, 2007 is $7.2 million ($4.7 million, net of tax) and $3.4 million ($2.2 million, net of
tax), respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”, the Company has recorded unrecognized losses and prior service credits of $10.0 million ($6.5 million net of tax benefits) cumulatively through December 31, 2006. The
unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets less accrued pension costs as of September 30, 2006. This
adjustment results in a direct reduction of stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings.

Other Matters

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Staff Position No. 106-2 (“FSP 106-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related
to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the “Act”). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (“Medicare Part D”) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
post-retirement health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP 106-2 provides authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy and specifies the disclosure
requirements for employers who have adopted FSP 106-2. FSP 106-2 was effective for the Company’s third quarter of 2004 and was reflected for all of 2005. Detailed final regulations necessary to implement the Act were issued in 2005, including
those that specify the manner in which actuarial equivalency must be determined, the evidence required to demonstrate actuarial equivalency, and the documentation requirements necessary to be entitled to the subsidy based on an actuarial analysis
prepared in 2005. The Company has confirmed that certain benefit options within its retiree medical plans provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. As a result, the accrued post-retirement benefit obligation
reflects a reduction of $6 million at December 31, 2006, the annual net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2006 was reduced by $1 million, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
2006 was reduced by $10 million.

LEASES AND COMMITMENTS:

The Company’s leases extend for
varying periods of time up to 10 years and, in some cases, contain renewal options. Future minimum rental payments for all operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $77 million in 2007, $56
million in 2008, $59 million in 2009, $32 million in 2010, $24 million in 2011 and $42 million thereafter. Total rent expense charged to income for all operating leases was $84 million, $68 million and, $62 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company generally accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. In general, manufactured
products are warranted against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Warranty period terms depend on the nature of the product and range from 90 days up
to the life of the product. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain
instances estimated property damage. The liability, shown in the following table, is reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted as additional information regarding expected warranty costs becomes known.

In certain cases the Company will sell extended warranty or maintenance agreements. The proceeds from these agreements is deferred and recognized as revenue over the
term of the agreement.

The following is a rollforward of the Company’s warranty accrual for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 ($ in

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES:

Accu-Sort, Inc., a subsidiary of the
Company, was a defendant in a suit filed by Federal Express Corporation on May 16, 2001 and subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging breach of contract, misappropriation of trade
secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and conversion. On March 9, 2006 Accu-Sort settled the case with Federal Express for an amount which the Company believes is not material to its financial position. Pursuant to the
settlement, the parties agreed to a release of claims related to the litigation and on March 10, 2006 jointly dismissed the litigation with prejudice. The settlement of this litigation was reflected in the results of operations in
2005. The purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired Accu-Sort in 2003 provides certain indemnification for the Company with respect to this matter, and an arbitrator has ordered the former owners of Accu-Sort to pay the Company
a portion of the losses incurred by the Company in connection with this litigation. The Company is pursuing collection of this amount and the amount will be recorded as income when collected.

The Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the
use of the Company’s products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of
these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company
against potential loss exposures. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential
loss exposures. The Company believes that the results of these litigation matters and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on its cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related
insurance or indemnification recoveries.

The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of
predetermined retained amounts. The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions under its insurance policies, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management
determines the Company’s accrual for self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.



The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by
law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other
entity, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.

In addition, certain of the Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose
limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company must also comply with various health and safety
regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

In addition to environmental compliance
costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in
disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory
authority. The Company has received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where the Company and others disposed of hazardous wastes
require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company has projects underway at
several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. The Company is also from time to time party to personal injury
or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.

The Company has made a provision
for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with
similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential remediation liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the
site. The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While the Company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries as
well as appropriate recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to
predict given the uncertainties of the Company’s involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and
regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.

In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability,
if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no known probable but inestimable exposures that are expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position and results of operations.

INCOME TAXES:

The provision for income taxes for the years ended
December 31 consists of the following ($ in thousands):



Current deferred income tax assets are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Long-term deferred income
tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Deferred income taxes consist of the following ($ in thousands):

Deferred taxes associated with temporary differences resulting from timing of recognition for income tax purposes
of fees paid for services rendered between consolidated entities are reflected as deferred service income in the above table. These fees are fully eliminated in consolidation and have no effect on reported revenue, income or reported income tax
expense.

The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31 varies from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2006 benefited from the reduction of valuation allowances related
to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized, the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves and the impact of a change in
German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits

.

The Company made income tax
payments of $204 million, $168 million and, $127 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $36 million, $15 million, and $17 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the exercise of
employee stock options, which vested prior to the Company’s adoption of SFAS 123R and for which no expense was recognized. This benefit has been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.

Included in deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2006 are tax benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaling $65 million (net of
applicable valuation allowances of $124 million). Certain of the losses can be carried forward indefinitely and others can be carried forward to various dates through 2026. The recognition of any future benefit resulting from the reduction of
valuation allowance established in purchase accounting will reduce goodwill of the acquired business. In addition, the Company had general business and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $61 million at December 31, 2006.



The Company provides income taxes for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are not considered permanently
reinvested overseas. As of December 31, 2006, the approximate amount of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers permanently reinvested and for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $3.4 billion.
United States income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the amount of such taxes that may be applicable is not readily determinable given the various tax planning
alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings.

The Company’s legal and tax structure reflects both the number
of acquisitions and dispositions that have occurred over the years as well as the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Company’s businesses. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues
amounts for potential tax contingencies. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. Reserves for
these tax matters are included in “Taxes, income and other” in accrued expenses as detailed in Note 6 in the accompanying financial statements.

(13) EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS):

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the numerator and the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Information related
to the calculation of earnings per share of common stock is summarized as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

STOCK TRANSACTIONS:

On April 21, 2005, the Company’s
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Company’s
repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any
time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s 1998 Stock Option Plan or successor plan and for other corporate purposes.

During 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $258 million. The repurchases were funded from available cash and
from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2006. At December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 5 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board
authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or existing lines of credit.

On
April 22, 2004, the company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of its common stock. The split was effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on May 20, 2004 to shareholders of record on May 6, 2004. All share
and per share information presented in this Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this split.

Stock options and restricted
stock units (RSUs) have been issued to directors, officers and other management employees under the Company’s Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan. The stock options generally vest over a five-year period and terminate ten years from the
issuance date. Option exercise prices equal the closing price on the NYSE of the common stock on the date of grant. RSUs provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s common stock at no cost to the holder and vest over terms and are
subject to performance criteria determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Prior to vesting, RSUs do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued
and outstanding. Shares are issued on the date the RSUs vest.

The options and RSUs generally vest only if the employee is employed by the Company on the
vesting date or in other limited circumstances, and unvested options and RSUs are forfeited upon retirement before age 65 unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines otherwise. To cover the exercise of vested options and
RSUs, the Company generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2006, approximately 13 million shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”),
which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options and RSUs, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. SFAS 123R supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB 25”). The Company has adopted SFAS 123R
using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards
over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimated forfeiture rates for year ended December 31, 2006 based on its historical experience. Stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $67
million has been recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as payroll costs of the employees are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that
compensation cost be recognized for the Company’s stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Under APB 25, the Company was required to record expense over
the vesting period for the value of RSUs granted. Compensation expense related to RSU awards is calculated based on the market prices of Company common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure amounts
in accordance with SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” (SFAS No. 148), as if the fair value method defined by SFAS No. 123 had been applied to its stock-based compensation.

The estimated fair value of the options granted during 2006 and prior years was calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model
(Black-Scholes). The following summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes models for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:



The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate of interest for
periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the expected term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s
stock and historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company generally uses the midpoint between the end of the vesting period and the contractual life of the grant to estimate option exercise timing within the valuation model. This
methodology is not materially different from the Company’s historical data on exercise timing. Separate groups of employees that have similar behavior with regard to holding options for longer periods and different forfeiture rates are
considered separately for valuation and attribution purposes.

As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006
was $39 million (net of $16 million tax benefit) lower than if the Company had continued to account for stock – based compensation under APB 25. The impact on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
$0.12, respectively, per share. Pro forma net earnings as if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards is as follows:

The following table summarizes the components of the Company's stock-based compensation program recorded as
expense ($ in thousands):

As of December 31, 2006, $55 million and $171 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
restricted stock units and stock options, respectively, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 4 years for RSUs and 2.5 years for stock options.



Option activity under the Company’s stock option plan as of December 31, 2006 and changes during the three
years ended December 31, 2006 were as follows (in 000’s; except exercise price and number of years):



Options outstanding at December 31, 2006 are summarized below:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference
between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2006 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their
options on December 31, 2006. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $109.7 million, $35.2 million and $45.9 million, respectively. Exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 resulted in cash receipts of $59.5 million, $38.1 million and $31.4 million, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $35.6 million, $15.2 million, and $16.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively related to
the exercise of employee stock options, which has been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.

The following table summarizes information
on unvested restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2006:

SEGMENT DATA:

Beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the
Company realigned its segment reporting primarily due to significant acquisitions in 2006. The Company previously reported under three segments: Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components. The Company
currently reports under four segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components. The Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components segments remain unchanged between the
current year and prior year’s presentations. The Professional Instrumentation segment has been realigned under Professional Instrumentation, comprising electronic test and environmental companies and Medical Technologies, comprising the medical
technologies companies. All prior year information has been recast to reflect this realignment.

Operating profit represents total revenues less operating
expenses, excluding other expense, interest and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment are those used in each segment’s operations. Inter-segment amounts are not significant and are eliminated to arrive at consolidated totals.

Detailed segment data for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented in the following table (in thousands):

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

In November 2004, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43,
Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 was effective in the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a significant impact on
the Company’s results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards. See Note 14 for further discussion.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109”, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this Interpretation and guidance on its application, the Company currently estimates the
adoption of FIN 48 will reduce the amount recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions by approximately $60 to $80 million. This reduction will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings, as of January 1, 2007.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans (collectively, “postretirement benefit plans”) to recognize the
funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and provide additional
disclosures. On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158. See Notes 8 and Note 9 for further discussion of the effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
