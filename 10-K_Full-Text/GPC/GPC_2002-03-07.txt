ITEM I.      BUSINESS.

Genuine Parts Company, a Georgia corporation incorporated on May 7, 1928,
is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement
parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic
materials. In 2001, business was conducted throughout most of the United
States, in Canada and in Mexico from approximately 1,800 locations. As used in
this report, the “Company” refers to Genuine Parts Company and its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated by the context; and the terms
“automotive parts” and “industrial parts” refer to replacement parts in each
respective category.

Segment Data

. For information regarding
segment data, refer to the Company’s Audited Financial Statements as
set forth on pages 17 and 33 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for 2001.

Competition – General

. The distribution business, which includes all segments
of the Company’s business, is highly competitive with the principal methods of
competition being product quality, sufficiency of inventory, price and the
ability to give the customer prompt and dependable service. The Company
anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the
foreseeable future.

Employees

. As of December 31, 2001, the Company employed approximately 31,000
persons.

AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

.

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is
the largest member of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a
voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution
of automotive parts. In addition to over 300,000 available part numbers, the
Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket. The
Automotive Parts Group is working to develop additional channels of
distribution through e-commerce initiatives.

During 2001, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive
parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or
“NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned in the United States by Genuine Parts Company;
automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in Canada owned and
operated by UAP, a wholly-owned subsidiary; auto parts stores in the United
States operated by corporations in which Genuine Parts Company owned either a
minority or majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by
corporations in which UAP owned a 50% interest; distribution centers owned by
Balkamp, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary; rebuilding plants owned by the
Company and operated by its Rayloc division; distribution centers of ACDelco,
Motorcraft and other automotive supplies owned and operated by Johnson
Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary; and automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto
Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a company in which a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Genuine Parts Company owns a controlling interest.

In 2001, Johnson Industries acquired Coach and Motors, a single branch
distribution center in Detroit, Michigan. The Automotive Parts Group
acquired Morgan’s Auto Supply, four NAPA stores in Maine; Taylor
Automotive, four NAPA stores in Indiana and Granger Supply Company,
one NAPA store in Utah.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a
subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair
information company with over 35,000 North American subscribers linked to its
services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND”,
is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute
replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle
makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles,
trucks, SUV’s, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
addition, the Company distributes small engines and replacement parts for farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include
accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a
wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops,
service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing
companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns
and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.
Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from more than
65 different suppliers, approximately 61% of 2001
automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since
1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which
has protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2001, Genuine Parts Company operated 61 domestic NAPA
automotive parts distribution centers located in 38 states and approximately
840 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states. At
December 31, 2001, Genuine Parts Company owned either a minority
or majority interest in 56 corporations which operated approximately
120 auto parts stores in 29 states.

UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution, marketing,
and rebuilding of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks.
UAP has annual sales of approximately $747 million Canadian ($482 million US)
and employs approximately 4,200 people. UAP operates a network of 15
distribution centers supplying approximately 603 UAP/NAPA auto parts and 53
TRACTION wholesalers, which supply parts to small fleet owners and operators.
These include approximately 170 company owned stores, 30 joint venture or
progressive owners in which UAP owns a 50% interest, and approximately 406
independently owned stores. UAP supplies bannered installers and independent
installers in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service stations
and repair shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is
licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 10 distribution centers and 18 auto
parts stores. Auto Todo is licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Mexico.

The Company’s distribution centers serve approximately 5,000 independently
owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served. NAPA
AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the
automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts
stores account for approximately 25% of the Company’s total sales with no
automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or
common ownership accounting for more than 0.5% of the total sales of the
Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 300,000 different parts and
related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification
and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and
frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same
day as received. The majority of sales are on terms which require payment
within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of
the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under
the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. A majority-owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company,
Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and
accessory items for passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm
equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing
equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and
supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp
packages many of the approximately 24,000 part numbers which constitute the
“Balkamp” line of products which are distributed to the members of NAPA. These
products are categorized in 160 different product groups purchased from more
than 400 domestic suppliers and 130 foreign manufacturers. In addition to the
Balkamp line of products, Balkamp distributes approximately 100 part numbers of
nationally branded consumer appearance products and oils through their
Automotive Redistribution Center. These products are cataloged separately for
convenience for NAPA customers. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is
important to the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.
Balkamp has four distribution centers located in Indianapolis and Plainfield,
Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi, and West Jordan, Utah.

Johnson Industries (“Johnson”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
is an independent distributor of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive
supplies. Johnson, founded in 1924, sells primarily to large fleets and new
car dealers as well as providing ACDelco products to NAPA members. Johnson has
12 distribution centers throughout the U.S.

-3-


The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates five plants where
certain small automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are distributed to
the members of NAPA under the NAPA brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to
the Company by NAPA.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2001, sales from the Automotive
Parts Group approximated 51% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 50% in
2000 and 51% in 1999.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and
the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services
include fast and frequent delivery, obsolescence protection, parts cataloging
(including the use of computerized NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock
adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent jobbers to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The
Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids,
marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis,
accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, marketing
conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.
Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive
Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company
for the NAPA AUTO PARTS store.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an
inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and
auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on
automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological
advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control
procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management
services, which the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store
customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant, and the Company attributes this to the successful
operation of its classification system, which involves product return
privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for
vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those which they build
themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts
retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets
of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national
retail chains, and with other parts distributors and jobbers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of
automotive replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2001 operated 68
distribution centers located throughout the United States, 61 of which were
owned and operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and
programs that may be used by its members. It is not involved in the chain of
distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes
are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA”
lines. The members are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts
so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from other supply
sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered
trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program,
which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to
promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA
itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit,
Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under
the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of
sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform
policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of,
or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

all types of industries located throughout the United States, Mexico and
Canada.

Distribution System

. In North and South America, the Industrial Parts Group

suppliers. Sales are generated from the Group’s branches located in 48 states,
nine provinces in Canada, and seven cities in Mexico. Each branch has warehouse
facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the

inventories and the ability to provide prompt and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the
customer. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries
are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all
sales are on open account.

Related Information

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with
most of the Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it
has been the experience of the Group that the custom of the trade is to treat
such agreements as continuing until breached by one party, or until terminated
by mutual consent.

Integrated Supply

. Motion’s integrated supply process reduces the costs
associated with MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operation) inventory management,
but also enables the manufacturing customer to focus on its core competency,
free working capital associated with inventories, improve service levels to
end-users, and allow management to focus on more strategic concerns. Motion’s
integrated supply process analyzes a customer’s
current operation to develop integration goals and then provides solutions
based on industry’s accepted best practices.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2001, sales from the Company’s
Industrial Parts Group approximated 27% of the Company’s net sales as compared
to 28% in 2000 and 27% in 1999.

-5-


Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors
specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and
others who have developed or joined integrated supply programs. To a lesser
extent, the Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the
customer.
