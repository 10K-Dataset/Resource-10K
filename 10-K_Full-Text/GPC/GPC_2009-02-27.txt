AUTOMOTIVE
    PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
    distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items.
    The Company is the largest member, with approximately 95%
    ownership, of the National Automotive Parts Association
    (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925
    to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In
    addition to over 380,000 available part numbers, the Company, in
    conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
    marketing, training and other programs in the automotive
    aftermarket.

During 2008, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included
    NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts
    stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores”) owned and operated in the United States by the
    Company; NAPA and TRACTION automotive parts distribution centers
    and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and
    operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA
    Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company;
    auto parts stores and distribution centers in the United States
    operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a
    minority or majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada
    operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50% interest;
    distribution centers in the United States owned by Balkamp, Inc.
    (“Balkamp”), a majority-owned subsidiary of the
    Company; rebuilding and distribution plants in the United States
    owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; and
    automotive parts distribution



centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and
    operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto
    Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company increased its
    ownership interest in Altrom Canada Corp. and Altrom America
    Corp. to 100%. At December 31, 2008, the import automotive
    parts distribution centers in Canada are operated by Altrom
    Canada Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The import
    automotive parts distribution centers in the United States are
    operated by Altrom America, a division of the Company.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company sold all of its
    interests in Johnson Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary that
    provided automotive supplies, primarily to large fleets and new
    car dealers.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information
    (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC
    is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information
    company with over 40,000 North American subscribers linked to
    its services and information databases. MRIC’s core
    product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic
    repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers
    distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for
    substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in
    the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs,
    buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
    addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small
    engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The
    Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such
    vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety
    of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair
    shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck
    dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass
    merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who
    perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although
    the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from
    more than 90 different suppliers, approximately 52% of 2008
    automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major
    suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
    inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

.

In 2008, the
    Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution
    centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,100
    domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in
    43 states. At December 31, 2008, Genuine Parts Company
    owned either a minority or majority interest in three
    corporations, which operated approximately 19 auto parts stores
    in three states, and a subsidiary corporation operating three
    distribution centers in three states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the
    distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories
    for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs
    approximately 3,600 people and operates a network of 12
    distribution centers and three branches supplying approximately
    590 NAPA stores and 92 TRACTION wholesalers. TRACTION is a
    supplier of parts to small and large fleet owners and operators
    and, together with NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the
    mining and forestry industries. These include approximately
    208 company owned stores, 21 joint venture or progressive
    owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and
    approximately 454 independently owned stores. NAPA and TRACTION
    operations supply bannered installers and independent installers
    in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service
    station and repair shops operating under the banners of national
    accounts. UAP is a licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Canada.

In Canada, Altrom Canada Corp. operates 15 import automotive
    parts distribution centers. In the United States, Altrom America
    operates two import automotive parts distribution centers.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates nine distribution
    centers, four auto parts stores and four tire centers. Auto Todo
    is a licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve
    approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores
    located throughout the market areas served in the United States.
    NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of
    customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these
    independent automotive parts stores account for approximately
    24% of the Company’s total sales with no automotive parts
    store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or
    common ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total
    sales of the Company.



Products

.

Distribution centers have
    access to over 380,000 different parts and related supply items.
    Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and
    accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide
    for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are
    filled and shipped the same day as received. The majority of
    sales are on terms that require payment within 30 days of
    the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the
    products it distributes. The majority of products are
    distributed under the
    NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

.

Balkamp distributes
    a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for
    passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm
    equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such
    as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning
    supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops,
    fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp packages many of the
    43,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line
    of products that are distributed to the members of NAPA. These
    products are categorized into over 220 different product groups
    purchased from approximately 600 domestic suppliers and 100
    foreign manufacturers. In addition, Balkamp operates two
    Redistribution Centers that provide NAPA with over 1,000 SKUs of
    oils, chemicals and procurement items.

    a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and
    marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has
    four distribution centers located in Indianapolis and
    Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi and West Jordan,
    Utah.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates three
    facilities where certain small automotive parts are rebuilt or
    distributed to the members of NAPA under the
    NAPA

®

brand name.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW
    Distribution, with one warehouse location in Atlanta, Georgia,
    which serves 18 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores, of which 13
    are owned and located in the United States. This group
    distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and
    direct to small fleet owners and operators.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2008, sales from the Automotive Parts Group
    were approximately 48% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 49% in 2007 and 2006.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

.

The
    Company believes that the quality and the range of services
    provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
    significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution
    system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
    obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of
    electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment
    through a continuing parts classification system which allows
    independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain
    merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA
    AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing
    aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost
    analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement
    benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars,
    sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of
    sale/inventory management is available through
    TAMS

®

(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system
    designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined
    an inventory classification system to determine optimum
    distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
    automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations,
    usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and
    other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
    analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s
    inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature
    of the inventory management services that the Company makes
    available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last
    10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been
    insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful
    operation of its classification system, which involves product
    return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

.

In the distribution of
    automotive parts, the Company competes with automobile
    manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles
    built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build
    themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large
    automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company
    competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers,
    oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail
    chains, and with other parts distributors and retailers.



NAPA

.

The Company is a member of the
    National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary association
    formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive
    replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
    parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2008
    operated 64 distribution centers located throughout the United
    States, 58 of which were owned and operated by the Company. NAPA
    develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its
    members. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and
    distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised
    and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not
    required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so
    designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from
    other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally
    registered trademark
    NAPA

®

as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
    parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national
    advertising program, which is designed to increase public
    recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and
    NAPA itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District
    Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
    decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust
    laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
    manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of
    territories among several NAPA members, fixing of prices or
    terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements
    to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or
    determining the number and location of, or arrangements with,
    auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL
    PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement
    parts and related supplies throughout the United States and
    Canada. This group distributes bearings, mechanical power
    transmission, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and
    pneumatic components, industrial supplies and material handling
    products. The Industrial Parts Group continues to enhance
    communication and process activities through three distinct
    programs: motionindustries.com, an internet-based procurement
    system; MiSupplierConnect, a manufacturer communication and
    fulfillment system; and inMotion, an internal employee
    communication source and operational reporting system.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States
    through Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”),
    headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion is a wholly owned
    subsidiary of the Company. In Canada, industrial parts are
    distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion
    Canada”), an operating group in the Company’s North
    American structure.

During 2008, Motion acquired the assets of Drago Supply Company
    with eight locations, Mill Supply Corporation with five
    locations, and Monroe Rubber and Plastic Supply with one
    location. All of the acquired companies are distributors of
    industrial parts and supplies in the United States.

As of December 31, 2008, the Industrial Parts Group served
    more than 100,000 customers in all types of industries located
    throughout the United States and Canada, including the food,
    forest products, primary metal, paper, mining, automotive,
    petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries.

Distribution System

.

In North America,
    the Industrial Parts Group operates 472 branches, 10
    distribution centers and 36 service centers as of
    December 31, 2008. The distribution centers stock and
    distribute more than 80,000 different items purchased from more
    than 250 different suppliers. The service centers provide
    hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers.
    Approximately 44% of 2008 total industrial product purchases
    were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the
    Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in
    47 states, Puerto Rico, and, nine provinces in Canada. Each
    branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts
    of inventory representative of the lines of products used by
    customers in the respective market area served.

Motion Canada operates two distribution centers for the 47
    Canadian branches serving industrial and agricultural markets.

Products

.

The Industrial Parts Group
    distributes a wide variety of products to its customers,
    primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants,
    machinery and equipment. Products include such items as hoses,
    belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears,
    sprockets, speed reducers and electric motors. The



nature of this group’s business demands the maintenance of
    large inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding
    delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed
    are installed by the customer. Most orders are filled
    immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made
    within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all
    sales are on open account.

Supply Agreements

.

Non-exclusive
    distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial
    Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements
    vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial
    Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such
    agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until
    terminated by mutual consent. The Company has return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
    inventory obsolescence.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2008, sales from the Company’s Industrial
    Parts Group approximated 32% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 31% in 2007 and 30% in 2006.

Competition

.

The Industrial Parts Group
    competes with other distributors specializing in the
    distribution of such items, general line distributors and others
    who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial
    Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to
    the customer.

    Company (“S. P. Richards”), a wholly owned subsidiary
    of the Company, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. S. P.

    many other wholesale distributors as well as with certain
    manufacturers of office products.

ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC
    MATERIALS GROUP

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group was formed on
    July 1, 1998 through the acquisition of EIS, Inc.
    (“EIS”) headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. This Group
    distributes materials to more than 20,000 electrical and
    electronic manufacturers in North America. With 33 branch
    locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican
    Republic, Mexico and Canada, this Group distributes over 100,000
    items, from insulating and conductive materials to assembly
    tools and test equipment. EIS also has three manufacturing
    facilities that provide custom fabricated parts.

During 2008, EIS acquired the assets of C.H. Clowers Supply
    Company, an electrical distribution company, with one location
    in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Clowers is a complementary acquisition,
    which enhances the ability of EIS to distribute materials in the
    state of Arkansas.

Distribution System

.

The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group provides distribution
    services to original equipment manufacturers, motor repair shops
    and assembly markets. EIS actively utilizes its

E-commerce

Internet site to present its products to customers while
    allowing these on-line visitors to conveniently purchase from a
    large product assortment.

Electrical and electronic products are distributed from
    warehouse locations in major user markets throughout the United
    States, as well as in Mexico and Canada. The Company has return
    privileges with some of its suppliers, which has protected the
    Company from inventory obsolescence.

Products

.

The Electrical/Electronic
    Materials Group distributes a wide variety of products to
    customers from over 350 vendors. These products include custom
    fabricated flexible materials that are used as components within
    a customer’s manufactured finished product in a variety of
    market segments. Among the products distributed and fabricated
    are such items as magnet wire, conductive materials, insulating
    and shielding materials, assembly tools, test equipment,
    adhesives and chemicals, pressure sensitive tapes, solder,
    anti-static products and thermal management products. To meet
    the prompt delivery demands of its customers, this Group
    maintains large inventories. The majority of sales are on open
    account. Approximately 45% of 2008 total Electrical/Electronic
    Materials Group purchases were made from 10 major suppliers.

Integrated Supply

.

The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group’s integrated supply
    programs are a part of the marketing strategy, as a greater
    number of customers — especially national
    accounts — are given the opportunity to participate in
    this low-cost, high-service capability. The Group developed AIMS
    (Advanced Inventory Management System), a totally integrated,
    highly automated solution for inventory management. The
    Group’s Integrated Supply offering also includes SupplyPro,
    an electronic vending dispenser used to eliminate costly tool
    cribs, or in-house stores, at customer warehouse facilities.

Segment Data

.

In each of the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, sales from the
    Company’s Electrical/Electronic Materials Group
    approximated 4% of the Company’s net sales.



Competition

.

The Electrical/Electronic
    Materials Group competes with other distributors specializing in
    the distribution of electrical and electronic products, general
    line distributors and, to a lesser extent, manufacturers that
    sell directly to customers.

RISK
    FACTORS

.

Set forth below are some risks and uncertainties that, if they
    were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our
    business or could cause our actual results to differ materially
    from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
    in this report and in the other public statements we make. Our
    forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to our
    future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition,
    economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry
    conditions and demand for our products and services. While we
    believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in
    view of currently available information, you are cautioned not
    to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, due
    in part to the risk factors below.

Forward-looking statements made herein, as well as in materials
    we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public,
    including materials that we make available on our website and
    verbal statements made by senior officers to analysts,
    investors, the media and others, are subject to the safe harbor
    provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they
    are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its
    forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are
    advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on
    related subjects in our subsequent

We
    Depend On Our Relationships with Our Vendors, and a Disruption
    of Our Vendor Relationships or a Disruption in Our Vendors’
    Operations Could Harm Our Business

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial
    parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our
    business depends on developing and maintaining close and
    productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our
    vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many
    factors outside our control may harm our relationships with our
    vendors. For example, financial or operational difficulties with
    a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the
    products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also
    limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase
    products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these
    products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or
    industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our
    relationship with some vendors. In our automotive business, the
    number of vendors could decrease considerably, and the prices
    charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase, as
    vehicle production slows due to the decline in consumer spending
    and, possibly, the failure of one or more of the large
    automobile manufacturers. We would suffer an adverse impact if
    our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently
    protect us from inventory obsolescence. A disruption of our
    vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’
    operations could have a material adverse effect on our business
    and results of operations.

Our
    Business Likely Will Continue To Be Impacted By Declining
    Economic Conditions

Our business and results of operations may continue to be
    adversely impacted by declining global, national and local
    economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer,
    commercial and industrial spending. These economic conditions
    have deteriorated significantly in recent months. Some of the
    factors that have contributed to recent reduced levels of
    spending include conditions in the residential real estate and
    mortgage markets, conditions in the automobile industry,
    increases in fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare
    costs, access to credit, high unemployment rates, declining
    consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. These
    factors had a material adverse effect on demand for the
    Company’s products and services and on the Company’s
    financial condition and operating results in the fourth quarter
    of 2008. The current difficult economic climate is not expected
    to improve significantly in the near term, and the resulting low
    levels of consumer, commercial and industrial spending could
    continue to result in weakened demand for the products of all of
    our business groups for the foreseeable future.



Our
    Business Will Be Adversely Affected If Demand for Our Products
    Slows

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we
    distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.

With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher
    vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
    manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance
    offered on new vehicles;

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old
    and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the
    original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more
    maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;

•

gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from
    using their vehicles;

•

changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely
    more on other transportation;

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair
    information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by
    governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all
    diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the
    vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and

•

the economy generally.

With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors
    are:

•

the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity
    utilization, as these indices impact the need for industrial
    replacement parts;

•

changes in the level of the Institute for Supply
    Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading
    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while
    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing economy; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our office products group, the primary factors
    are :

•

the level of unemployment especially as it relates to white
    collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for business
    products; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the
    primary factors are:

•

changes in the level of the Institute for Supply
    Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading
    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while
    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing economy; and

•

the economy in general.

We
    Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do
    Business

The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and
    electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many
    factors including name recognition, product availability,
    customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences,
    store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer
    competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we
    may be forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a
    material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased
    competition among distributors of automotive and industrial
    parts, office products and electronic materials, including
    internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations.



In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is
    highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of
    competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional
    auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local
    automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that
    supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass
    merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products
    and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If
    we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive
    strategies, including internet related initiatives, or if our
    competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose
    customers and our sales and profits may decline.

The
    Impairment of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect
    Us

The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility
    and disruption for more than twelve months. In the past several
    months, volatility and disruptions have increased and recently
    reached unprecedented levels. We have exposure to counterparties
    with which we routinely execute transactions. Such
    counterparties include commercial banks, insurance companies,
    investment funds and other financial institutions, some of which
    may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks. While we have
    not realized any significant losses to date, a bankruptcy or
    illiquidity event by one of our significant counterparties could
    materially and adversely affect our access to capital, future
    business and results of operations.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental
    proceedings, many involving routine litigation incidental to the
    businesses, including approximately 1,500 product liability
    lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of automotive
    parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal
    injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts
    distributed by the Company. While litigation of any type
    contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that
    its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably
    anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary
    course of the Company’s business and that resolution of
    these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, results of operations or financial
    condition.
