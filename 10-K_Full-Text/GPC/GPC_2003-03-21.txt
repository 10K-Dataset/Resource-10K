materials. In 2002, business was conducted throughout the United States, in
Canada and in Mexico from approximately 1,800 locations. As used in this
report, the “Company” refers to Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries,
except as otherwise indicated by the context; and the terms “automotive parts”
and “industrial parts” refer to replacement parts in each respective category.

Segment Data

. For information regarding
segment data, refer to the Company’s
Audited Financial Statements as set forth on Pages 17 and 37 of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for 2002.

Competition - General

. The distribution business, which includes all segments
of the Company’s business, is highly competitive with the principal methods of
competition being product quality, sufficiency of inventory, price and the
ability to give the customer prompt and dependable service. The Company
anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the
foreseeable future.

Employees

. As of December 31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 30,700
persons.

AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

.

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is
the largest member of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a
voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution
of automotive parts. In addition to over 300,000 available part numbers, the
Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket.

During 2002, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive
parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or
“NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned in the United States by Genuine Parts Company;
automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in Canada owned and
operated by UAP, a wholly-owned subsidiary; auto parts stores in the United
States operated by corporations in which Genuine Parts Company owned either a
minority or majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by
corporations in which UAP owned a 50% interest; distribution centers owned by
Balkamp, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary; rebuilding plants owned by the
Company and operated by its Rayloc division; distribution centers of ACDelco,
Motorcraft and other automotive supplies owned and operated by Johnson
Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary; and automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto
Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a company in which a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Genuine Parts Company owns a controlling interest.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a
subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair
information company with over 35,000 North American subscribers linked to its
services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND”,
is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute
replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle
makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles,
trucks, SUV’s, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include
accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a
wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops,
service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing
companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns
and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.
Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from more than
65 different suppliers, approximately 58% of 2002 automotive parts inventories
were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company

-2-


has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the
Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2002, Genuine Parts Company operated 57 domestic NAPA
automotive parts distribution centers located in 37 states and approximately
900 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states. At
December 31, 2002, Genuine Parts Company owned either a minority or majority
interest in 31 corporations, which operated approximately 53 auto parts stores
in 19 states.

UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution, marketing,
and rebuilding of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks.
UAP employs approximately 4,000 people. UAP operates a network of 15
distribution centers supplying approximately 600 UAP/NAPA auto parts and 54
TRACTION wholesalers, which supply parts to small fleet owners-operators and
are a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries. These
include approximately 202 company owned stores, 24 joint venture or progressive
owners in which UAP owns a 50% interest, and approximately 430 independently
owned stores. UAP supplies bannered installers and independent installers in
all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service station and repair
shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is licensed to and
uses the NAPA® name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 10 distribution centers and 18 auto
parts stores. Auto Todo is licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Mexico.

The Company’s distribution centers serve approximately 5,000 independently
owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served. NAPA
AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the
automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts
stores account for approximately 25% of the Company’s total sales with no
automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or
common ownership accounting for more than 0.5% of the total sales of the
Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 300,000 different parts and
related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification
and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and

frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same
day as received. The majority of sales are on terms that require payment
within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of
the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under
the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. A majority-owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company,
Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and
accessory items for passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm
equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing
equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and
supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp
packages many of the approximately 24,000 part numbers, which constitute the
“Balkamp” line of products that are distributed to the members of NAPA. These
products are categorized in 160 different product groups purchased from more
than 400 domestic suppliers and 130 foreign manufacturers. BALKAMP®, a
federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing
promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has four distribution centers
located in Indianapolis and Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi, and
West Jordan, Utah.

Johnson Industries (“Johnson”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
is an independent distributor of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive
supplies. Johnson, founded in 1924, sells primarily to large fleets and new
car dealers as well as providing ACDelco products to NAPA members. Johnson has


11 distribution centers throughout the U.S.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates five plants where
certain small automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are distributed to
the members of NAPA under the NAPA brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to
the Company by NAPA.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2002, sales from the Automotive
Parts Group approximated 52% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 51% in
2001 and 50% in 2000.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and
the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such
services include fast and frequent delivery, obsolescence protection, parts
cataloging (including the use of computerized NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and
stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent jobbers to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The
Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids,
marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis,
accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, marketing
conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.
Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive
Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company
for the NAPA AUTO PARTS store.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an
inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and
auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on
automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological
advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control
procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management
services, which the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store
customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant, and the Company attributes this to the successful
operation of its classification system, which involves product return
privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for
vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those which they build
themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts
retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets
of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national
retail chains, and with other parts distributors and jobbers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of
automotive replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2002 operated 64
distribution centers located throughout the United States, 57 of which were
owned and operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and
programs that may be used by its members. It is not involved in the chain of
distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes
are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA”
lines. The members are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts
so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from other supply
sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered
trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program,
which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to
promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA
itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit,
Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under
the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among
such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts
customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto
parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP.

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts and
related supplies throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This Group
distributes industrial bearings and power transmission equipment replacement
parts, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material handling
components, agricultural and irrigation equipment and related supplies. The
Group is continuing to enhance their internet-based procurement solutions with
MotionMRO.com.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States through
Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.
Motion Industries is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In Canada,
industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. [“Motion
(Canada)”], an operating group in the North American structure. Motion
(Canada)’s service area includes nine provinces of Alberta, British Columbia,
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and
Saskatchewan. In Mexico, industrial parts are distributed by another operating
division, Motion Industries (Mexico) [(“Motion (Mexico)”], through a
partnership with power transmission specialist Refacciones Industriales de
Mexico (RIMSA). Motion (Mexico) serves the market through seven locations in
seven major Mexican cities. The Company has return privileges with most of its
suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

As of December 31, 2002, the Group served more than 150,000 customers in
all types of industries located throughout the United States, Mexico and
Canada.

Distribution System

. In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operates 466
branches, nine distribution centers, and 29 service centers. The distribution
centers stock and distribute more than 200,000 different items purchased from
more than 250 different suppliers. Approximately 62% of 2002 total industrial
purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the
Group’s branches located in 48 states, nine provinces in Canada, and seven
cities in Mexico. Each branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant
amounts of inventory representative of the lines of products used by customers
in the respective market area served.

Motion (Canada) operates two distribution centers for the 64 Canadian
locations serving industrial and agricultural markets. Motion (Canada) also
distributes irrigation systems and related supplies.

Products

. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to
its customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants,
machinery and equipment. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings,
pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers and electric
motors. The nature of this Group’s business demands the maintenance of large
inventories and the ability to provide prompt and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the
customer. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries
are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all
sales are on open account.

Related Information

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with
most of the Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it
has been the experience of the Group that the custom of the trade is to treat
such agreements as continuing until breached by one party, or until terminated
by mutual consent.

Integrated Supply

. Motion’s integrated supply process reduces the costs
associated with MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operation) inventory management,
but also enables the manufacturing customer to focus on its core competency,
free working capital associated with inventories, improve service levels to
end-users, and allow management to focus on more strategic concerns. Motion’s
integrated supply process analyzes a customer’s current operation to develop
integration goals and then provides solutions based on industry’s accepted best
practices.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2002, sales from the Company’s
Industrial Parts Group approximated 27% of the Company’s net sales as compared
to 27% in 2001 and 28% in 2000.

-5-


Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors
specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and
others who have developed or joined integrated supply programs. To a lesser
extent, the Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the
customer.

Inventory Management System), a totally integrated, highly automated solution
for inventory management. The Group’s Integrated Supply offering also includes

type contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that its defense
and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will
continue to occur within the ordinary course of the Company’s business, and
that resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the

directors of the Company and permits participants to defer the receipt of all
of their director fees and/or meeting fees until a specified date, which must
be at least two calendar years following the date of the election to defer.
Participants may elect to have the deferred amounts allocated to an interest
bearing account or an account that is credited with Company common stock
equivalents. Each participant may elect to receive payment of the deferred
amounts in cash or shares of Company common stock. The shares of Company
common stock distributable to directors under this plan must be previously
issued and repurchased shares and may not be original issue shares. A maximum
of 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be distributed under this plan.

Within the 90-day period prior to the date of this report, an evaluation was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the

disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. There have been no
significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date that

The registrant’s other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant and we have:

a)

designed such disclosure
controls and procedures
to ensure that material
information relating to
the registrant,
including its
consolidated
subsidiaries, is made
known to us by others
within those entities,
particularly during the
period in which this
annual report is being
prepared;

b)

evaluated the
effectiveness of the
registrant’s disclosure
controls and procedures
as of a date within 90
days prior to the filing
date of this annual
report (the “Evaluation
Date”); and

c)

presented in this annual
report our conclusions
about the effectiveness
of the disclosure
controls and procedures
based on our evaluation
as of the Evaluation
Date;

5.

The registrant’s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most
recent evaluation, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of
registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):

a)

all significant
deficiencies in the
design or operation of
internal controls which
could adversely affect
the registrant’s ability
to record, process,
summarize and report
financial data and have
identified for the
registrant’s auditors
any material weaknesses
in internal controls;
and

b)

any fraud, whether or
not material, that
involves management or
other employees who have
a significant role in
the registrant’s
internal controls; and

6.

The registrant’s other certifying officers and I have indicated in this annual report
whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most
recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.
