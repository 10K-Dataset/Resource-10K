AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive parts and accessory items. In addition to nearly 450,000 available part numbers, the Company offers complete
inventory, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket. The Company, as a result of its acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts Co. in May 2012, is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association
(“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts.

During 2013, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores
(“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned and operated in the United States by the Company; NAPA and Traction automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and
operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores and distribution centers in the United States operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a
noncontrolling or controlling interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50% interest; import automotive parts distribution centers in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Altrom America
division; import automotive parts distribution centers in Canada owned and operated by Altrom Canada Corporation (“Altrom Canada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution centers in the United States owned by Balkamp, Inc.
(“Balkamp”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution facilities in the United


Index to Financial Statements

States owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; and automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de
C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

In addition, effective April 1, 2013, the Company
completed the purchase of the remaining 70% stake of Exego Group, subsequently renamed GPC Asia Pacific, for approximately $590 million (USD), net of cash acquired of $70 million, and the assumption of approximately $230 million (USD) in net debt.
The purchase was funded using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities. The Company had previously purchased a 30% stake in GPC Asia Pacific on January 1, 2012 for approximately $166 million (USD) in cash.
GPC Asia Pacific, headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, is a leading aftermarket distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in Australasia, with annual revenues of approximately $1.1 billion (USD) and a company-owned store
footprint of 460 locations across Australia and New Zealand. In 2012, the Company accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information company with over
40,000 North American subscribers linked to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND”, is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all
motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service
stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s
domestic automotive operations purchase from approximately 100 different suppliers, approximately 50% of 2013 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its
suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution
System

.

In 2013, the Company operated 62 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution centers located in 41 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 46 states. At
December 31, 2013, the Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in six corporations, which operated approximately 114 auto parts stores in nine states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution and marketing of replacement parts and
accessories for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs approximately 3,800 people and operates a network of 12 distribution centers supplying approximately 594 NAPA stores and 104 Traction wholesalers. Traction is a supplier of parts
to small and large fleet owners and operators and, together with NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries. The NAPA stores and Traction wholesalers in Canada include approximately 187 company owned stores, 12
joint ventures and 28 progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 471 independently owned stores. NAPA and Traction operations supply bannered installers and independent installers in all provinces of Canada, as
well as networks of service stations and repair shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the NAPA

®

name in Canada.

In Canada, Altrom Canada
operates 13 import automotive parts distribution centers. In the United States, Altrom America operates two import automotive parts distribution centers.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 11 distribution centers, four auto parts stores and four tire centers. Auto Todo is a licensee of the NAPA

®

name in Mexico.

In Australia and New
Zealand, GPC Asia Pacific is leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories. GPC Asia Pacific operates eight distribution centers, 399 Repco stores and 61 branches associated with the Ashdown Ingram, Motospecs and McLeod
operations.


Index to Financial Statements

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,900 independently
owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately
65% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 24% of the Company’s total sales, with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total sales
of the Company.

Products

.

Distribution centers have access to over
446,000 different parts and related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and
shipped the same day as they are received. The majority of sales are paid from statements with varied terms and conditions. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products.
Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market.

Related Operations

.

Balkamp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger cars,
heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and
institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 45,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that are distributed through the NAPA system. These products are categorized into over 175 different product categories purchased
from approximately 450 domestic suppliers and over 100 foreign manufacturers. Balkamp has two distribution centers located in Plainfield, Indiana, and West Jordan, Utah. In addition, Balkamp operates two redistribution centers that provide the NAPA
system with over 1,100 SKUs of oils and chemicals. BALKAMP

®

, a federally registered trademark, is important to
the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.

The Company, through its Rayloc division,
operates four facilities where certain small automotive parts are distributed through the NAPA system under the
NAPA

®

brand name. Rayloc

®

is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with one warehouse location in Atlanta, Georgia, which serves 22
Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the United States, of which 14 are company-owned and eight are independently owned. This group distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small fleet owners and operators.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales from the Automotive Parts Group were
approximately 53% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 49% in 2012 and 2011. For additional segment information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

.

The Company believes that the quality and the
range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA
AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis.
The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing
conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS

®

(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.

The Company, has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store
inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of
the Company’s inventory control procedures and


Index to Financial Statements

comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 20 years, losses to the Company
from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

.

The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition,
the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail chains, and with other parts distributors and retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product
offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”

NAPA

.

The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose sole member in 2013 owned and operated 62 distribution centers
located throughout the United States. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at December 31, 2013, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines within the NAPA system that the Company purchases and distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged,
advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may, and does, purchase competitive lines from other supply sources.

The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA

®

as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to
increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with the
former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements
with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting
parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group is operated as Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components,
industrial supplies and material handling products to MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”). The Mexican market is served
by Motion Mexico S de RL de CV (“Motion Mexico”). These organizations operate in the Company’s North American structure.

In 2013, the Industrial Parts Group served more than 150,000 customers in all types of industries located throughout North America, including the food and beverage, forest products, primary metal, pulp
and paper, mining, automotive, oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted specialty industries such as power generation, wastewater treatment facilities, wind power generation, solar power, government
projects, pipelines, railroad, ports, and others. Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of 5.6 million parts. Additionally, Motion provides U.S. government agencies access to approximately 600,000
products and replacement parts through a Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule.


Index to Financial Statements

In the fourth quarter of 2013, Motion made two strategic acquisitions. Effective
October 26, 2013, Motion acquired the stock of AST Bearings LLC (“AST”), with facilities in Montville, New Jersey and Irvine, California. AST is an industrial distributor specializing in high-precision, miniature and specialty
bearings, bushings and related services, with annual revenues of approximately $35 million. Effective December 2, 2013, Motion acquired the assets of Paragon Service & Supply, Inc. (“Paragon”), located in Lima, Ohio. Paragon
is a distributor of industrial cutting tools, abrasives and metal-working equipment, with approximately $15 million in annual revenues.

Effective January 31, 2014, Motion Canada acquired Commercial Solutions Inc. (“CSI”), which at that time was a public company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
“CSA”. CSI’s shares were delisted following the acquisition. Headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, CSI is an independent national distributor of industrial supplies, including bearings and power transmission products, complete solutions
for drilling rigs and industrial and safety supplies. Its customers represent a broad cross-section of industries and are served from 22 locations across Canada and one in the U.S. CSI is expected to generate approximately $100 million in annual
revenues.

The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through inventory management
and logistical solutions coupled with Motion’s vast product knowledge and system capabilities. The Company meets the MRO demand of a large and fragmented market with high levels of service in the areas of asset management, inventory and
logistics management, product application and utilization management processes. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and customer connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business capabilities, such as
MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer.

Distribution System

.

In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operated 511 branches, 15
distribution centers and 42 service centers as of December 31, 2013. The distribution centers stock and distribute more than 240,000 different items purchased from more than 1,100 different suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose
and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 34% of 2013 total industrial product purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, nine
provinces in Canada, and Mexico. Each branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market area served.

Products

.

The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its
customers, primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its
offering to include systems and automation products in response to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to
opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient product markets, focusing on product offerings such as energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this group’s
business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities.
Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with existing customers that
represent approximately 50% of the annual sales volume.

Supply Agreements

.

Non-exclusive
distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such
agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. Motion has return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales from the Company’s Industrial
Parts Group approximated 31% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 34% in 2012 and 33% in 2011. For additional segment information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.


Index to Financial Statements

Competition

.

The industrial parts distribution business
is highly competitive. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group
competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”

In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, sales from the Company’s Electrical/Electronic Materials Group approximated 4% of the Company’s net sales. For additional segment information,
see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.

Competition

.    The electrical and electronics distribution business is highly competitive. The
Electrical/Electronic Materials Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of electrical and electronic products, general line distributors and, to a lesser extent, manufacturers that sell directly to customers. EIS
competes primarily on factors of price, product offerings, service and engineered solutions. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in
the Industries in Which We Do Business.”

RISK FACTORS

.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some statements in this report, as well as in
other materials we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, the media and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to future operations, prospects, strategies, financial
condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and services. The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our
expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated in our
forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however, to review
any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent Forms 10-Q, Form 8-K and other reports to the SEC.

Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the
results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at
any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our securities.

Our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.

With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles;

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle
manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;


Index to Financial Statements

•

gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles;

•

changes in travel patterns, which may cause consumers to rely more on other transportation;

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation, as
consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and

•

the economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer discretionary spending.

With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors are:

•

the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization, as these indices reflect the need for industrial replacement parts;

•

changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading of 50 or
more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy;

•

the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas; and

•

the economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output.

With respect to our office products group, the primary factors are:

•

the increasing digitization of the workplace, as this impacts the need for certain office products;

•

the level of unemployment, especially as it relates to white collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for office products; and

•

the economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for office products consumption.

With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the primary factors are:

•

changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading of 50 or
more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy; and

•

the economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output.

Uncertainty and/or deterioration in general macro-economic conditions, including unemployment, inflation or deflation, high energy
costs, uncertain credit markets, or other economic conditions, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence,
fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. Both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources, which could result in existing or
potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products. Our vendors could experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Future weakness in the global economy could adversely
affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.

We depend on our relationships
with our vendors, and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business.

As a distributor of automotive parts, industrial parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our
vendors. We depend


Index to Financial Statements

on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, raw material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity, labor
disputes, transportation disruptions or weather conditions, could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner. Furthermore, financial or operational difficulties with a
particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could
materially affect the prices we pay for these products. In our automotive business, the number of vendors could decrease considerably, and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase, to the extent that vehicle production slows
due to a decline in consumer spending and, possibly, the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers. We would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory
obsolescence.

We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.

The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors,
including name recognition, product availability, customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we may be
forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials, including internet-related
initiatives, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We
compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and
wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. Furthermore, the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years. Consolidation among our competitors could further
enhance their financial position, provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete, and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more
effectively compete for customers. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

We may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and
earnings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We
have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, strategic acquisitions, geographic expansion (including through acquisitions),
sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. If we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if these initiatives are unsuccessful, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Successful implementation of
these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors contained in this
“Item 1A. Risk Factors”, adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:

•

the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or to increase promotional spending;

•

our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for our products in a timely manner;


Index to Financial Statements

•

our ability to successfully enter new markets, including by successfully identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition targets in these new markets;

•

our ability to effectively manage our costs;

•

our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses in our existing operations; and

•

the economy in general.

Because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.

We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various
actions. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or
if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, product quality standards, building and zoning requirements, as
well as employment law matters. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenses
could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

Stock Performance Graph

Set forth below is a line graph comparing the yearly dollar change in the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company’s Common
Stock against the cumulative total shareholder return of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index and a peer group composite index structured by the Company as set forth below for the five year period that commenced December 31, 2008 and
ended December 31, 2013. This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2008 in Genuine Parts Company Common Stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index (the Company is a member of the S&P 500, and its cumulative total shareholder
return went into calculating the S&P 500 results set forth in the graph) and the peer group composite index as set forth below and assumes reinvestment of all dividends.

Comparison of five year cumulative total shareholder return

Genuine Parts Company, S&P 500 Index and peer group composite index

In constructing the peer group composite index (“Peer Index”) for use in the stock performance
graph above, the Company used the shareholder returns of various publicly held companies (weighted in accordance with each company’s stock market capitalization at December 31, 2008 and including reinvestment of dividends) that compete
with the Company in three industry segments: automotive parts, industrial parts and office products (each group of companies included in the Peer Index as competing with the Company in a separate industry segment is hereinafter referred to as a
“Peer Group”). Included in the automotive parts Peer Group are those companies making up the Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index (the Company is a member of such industry group, and its individual shareholder return was included when
calculating the Peer Index results set forth in the performance graph). Included in the industrial parts Peer Group are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and Kaman Corporation and included in the office products Peer Group is United Stationers
Inc. The Peer Index does not break out a separate electrical/electronic peer group due to the fact that there is currently no true market comparative to EIS. The electrical/electronic component of sales is redistributed to the Company’s other
segments on a pro rata basis to calculate the final Peer Index.


Index to Financial Statements

In determining the Peer Index, each Peer Group was weighted to reflect the Company’s
annual net sales in each industry segment. Each industry segment of the Company comprised the following percentages of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years shown:

Holders

As of December 31, 2013, there were 5,071 holders of record of the Company’s common stock. The number of holders of record does not include beneficial owners of the common stock whose shares are

ITEM 7

.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

.

OVERVIEW

Genuine
Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts, industrial parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in
Atlanta, Georgia. In 2013, the Company conducted business throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Puerto Rico from approximately 2,600 locations.

We recorded consolidated net sales of $14.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 8% compared to $13.0
billion in 2012. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $685 million, up 6% from $648 million in 2012. The Company’s internal growth initiatives, including the positive impact of acquisitions, as well as
effective cost management, which we discuss further below, served to drive our solid financial performance for the year, despite the challenging market conditions that were experienced by our non-automotive business segments.

The 8% sales growth in 2013 follows a 4.5% revenue increase in 2012 and an 11% increase in revenues in 2011. Our 6% increase in net income
follows a 15% increase in net income in 2012 and a 19% increase in net income in 2011. In 2011, we experienced strong and steady growth in three of our four business segments, as conditions in these industries improved significantly from the
depressed levels associated with the recessionary period of 2009. These favorable conditions began to moderate following the first quarter of 2012, which created a more challenging sales environment over the balance of the year. In 2013, we
continued to experience difficult market conditions in the Industrial, Electrical/Electronic and Office industries, while the Automotive business performed reasonably well. Over the three year period of 2011 through 2013, our financial performance
was positively impacted by a variety of initiatives we implemented to grow sales and earnings in each of our four


Index to Financial Statements

businesses. Examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions, the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer
marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. We discuss these initiatives further below.

With regard to the December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet, the Company’s cash balance of $197 million was down from cash
of $403 million at December 31, 2012, due primarily to recent acquisitions in our Automotive, Industrial and Electrical/Electronic business segments during 2013, which are discussed further under Liquidity and Capital Resources. The
Company continues to maintain a strong cash position, supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2013. Accounts receivable increased by approximately 12%, which is less than our sales increase in the fourth
quarter of the year, and inventory was up by approximately 13%, or approximately 1% before the impact of acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $588 million or 35% from the prior year. The significant increase in this line item is due
primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers. Additionally, accounts payable associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 10% of the increase. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 was $765 million, an increase
of $265 million from $500 million at December 31, 2012.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Net Sales

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $14.1 billion, an 8% increase from 2012 driven by an 18.5% increase in the Automotive segment, that was offset by a 1% sales
decrease in our non-automotive businesses. Acquisitions, primarily in Automotive, but also in the Industrial and Electrical/Electronic businesses, contributed 7% to our total sales growth and increased sales volume accounted for the remaining 1%.
The impact of product inflation varied by business again in 2013 and, cumulatively, prices were flat in the Automotive segment, up approximately 1% in the Industrial and Electrical/Electronic segments and up approximately 0.5% in the Office segment.
The Company is well positioned to improve sales in 2014.

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012
totaled $13.0 billion, a 4.5% increase from 2011 and driven by sales increases in three of our four business segments. Acquisitions in our Automotive and Electrical businesses contributed 2% to our sales growth and increased sales volume added
approximately 2% to sales. The impact of product inflation varied by business, as, cumulatively, prices in 2012 were flat in the Automotive segment, up approximately 2% in the Industrial segment, flat in the Electrical/Electronic segment and up
approximately 3% in the Office segment.

Automotive Group

Net sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) were $7.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 18.5% from 2012. The increase
in sales for the year was primarily due to the April 1, 2013 acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific, formerly Exego, and the May 1, 2012 acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts Co. (“Quaker City”). Combined, these acquisitions
contributed approximately 15% to sales. Additionally, Automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of approximately 4%, offset slightly by the 0.5% negative impact of currency associated with our Canadian business. Automotive sales
were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our Mexican businesses. In 2013, Automotive revenues were up 3% in the first quarter, then up 22% in the second and third quarters and up 25% in the fourth
quarter. We believe that the


Index to Financial Statements

underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall aging of the vehicle population, remain solid and will serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket
maintenance and supply items in 2014. Based on these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our Automotive business, we expect to grow our sales for this group again in 2014.

Net sales for Automotive were $6.3 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% from 2011. The increase in sales for the year was primarily due
to the May 1, 2012 acquisition of Quaker City, which contributed approximately 3% to sales. Additionally, Automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of slightly more than 1%. Automotive sales were not materially impacted by
product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our Canadian and Mexican businesses. In 2012, Automotive revenues were up 6% in the first quarter, then up 4% in the second quarter, up 2.5% in the third quarter and up 5% in the fourth
quarter.

Industrial Group

Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (“Industrial”), were $4.4 billion in 2013, down slightly compared to 2012. Sales volumes in this business were down approximately 1%
from the prior year, while higher transaction values associated with product inflation added 1% to sales in 2013. The slight positive impact on sales from acquisitions was offset by the slight negative impact of currency associated with our Canadian
business. Industrial revenues were down 2% in the first quarter of 2013 , down 1% in the second quarter, down 2.5% in the third quarter and up 3% in the fourth quarter. We expect the recent acquisitions for this business segment, as well as other
internal growth initiatives and relatively stable manufacturing indicators, to provide us ample growth opportunities for our Industrial business in 2014.

Net sales for Industrial, were $4.5 billion in 2012, an increase of 7% compared to 2011. The positive impact of Industrial’s internal sales initiatives, which drove higher sales volume,
contributed 5% to sales. Higher transaction values in 2012 associated with product inflation added another 2% to sales. There was no material impact on sales from acquisitions and no effect of currency associated with our Canadian business.
Industrial revenues were up 12% in the first quarter of 2012, up 8% in the second quarter, then up 4.5% and 2% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Office Group

Net sales for S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group
(“Office”), were $1.6 billion in 2013, a 3% decrease in sales from 2012. The industry-wide weakness in office products consumption, driven by the ongoing elevated levels of white collar unemployment and the declining demand for paper
and paper-based office products due to workplace digitization, continues to pressure this segment, and we do not expect any meaningful improvement in these conditions in the near future. Overall, sales volume in Office declined by approximately 3.5%
for the year, offset by the benefit of slightly higher transaction values associated with price inflation of 0.5%. Sales decreased by 1% in the first quarter, 3% in the second and third quarters and 4% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our focus in
2014 will be on market share initiatives, product line extensions and further diversification of our product and customer portfolios.

Net sales for Office were $1.7 billion in 2012, flat with revenues in 2011. Overall, sales volume in Office declined by 3% for the year, offset by higher transaction values associated with price
inflation of approximately 3%. Sales decreased by 1% in the first, second and third quarters, and were up 3% in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Electrical/Electronic Group

Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and
Electronic Group (“Electrical/Electronic”), decreased to $569 million in 2013, down 2% from 2012. The decrease in revenues is attributable to several factors, as sales volume was down by 5% and copper pricing negatively impacted sales
by 1% relative to 2012. These items were partially offset by a 3% positive sales contribution from acquisitions and the benefit of higher transaction values associated with 1% price inflation for the year. Sales for Electrical/Electronic decreased
by 5% in the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter and 5% in the third quarter and were up 6% in the fourth quarter. Despite the slow market conditions for this segment in 2013, we expect the Electrical/Electronic business to benefit from its
internal growth initiatives, a gradually improving manufacturing environment and the incremental revenue from their recently completed acquisitions in the periods ahead.


Index to Financial Statements

Net sales for Electrical/Electronic increased to $583 million in 2012, up 4.5% from
2011. The increase in revenues is due primarily to acquisitions, which contributed approximately 8% to our sales growth in 2012. A 2.5% decrease in sales volume and a 1% negative impact from copper pricing for the year served to offset this
increase. Sales for Electrical/Electronic increased by 5% in the first quarter, and were up 9% in the second quarter, up 5% in the third quarter and were down 2% in the fourth quarter.

Cost of Goods Sold

The Company includes in Cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise, which represents the vast majority of this line item. Other costs in Cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in-bound
freight from the supplier, net of any vendor allowances and incentives. Cost of goods sold was $9.9 billion, $9.2 billion and $8.9 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 7% increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 from 2012
is directly related to the sales increase for the same period, as product inflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year. Cost of goods sold represented 70.0% of net sales in 2013, 71.0 %
of net sales in 2012 and 71.1% of net sales in 2011. The 100 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2013 primarily reflects the positive gross margin impact of the 100% company owned store model at GPC Asia Pacific.
Other changes in cost of goods sold, including the slight decrease in 2012 from 2011, reflect our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs.

In 2013, the Industrial, Electrical/Electronic and Office business segments experienced slight vendor price increases. In
2012, only the Industrial and Office business segments experienced vendor price increases. In 2011, all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases. In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our
customers to pass most of these along to them.

Operating Expenses

The Company includes in Selling, administrative and other expenses (“SG&A”), all personnel and personnel related costs at
its headquarters, distribution centers and stores, which accounts for approximately 65% of total SG&A. Additional costs in SG&A include our facilities, delivery, marketing, advertising, legal and professional costs.

SG&A increased by $371 million or approximately 14% to $3.0 billion in 2013, representing 21.4% of net sales, which compares
to 20.4% of net sales in 2012. Primarily, the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year is due to the 100% company owned store model at GPC Asia Pacific, which serves to increase both gross profit and SG&A
expenses. Additionally, we experienced decreased expense leverage in 2013 associated with the weak sales environment in our non-automotive businesses throughout the year. These items were partially offset by a $54 million one-time gain, net of other
expense adjustments, recorded to SG&A in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the April 1, 2013 acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific. Our management teams remain focused on properly managing the
Company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $134 million in 2013, an increase of $36 million or 36% from 2012. This increase primarily relates to the
depreciation for higher levels of capital expenditures and the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $9 million in 2013, an increase from $8 million in 2012. We believe the
Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2013.

SG&A increased by $54 million or
approximately 2% to $2.6 billion in 2012, representing 20.4% of net sales and down from 20.8% of net sales in 2011. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due to slightly greater expense leverage associated
with our sales growth, combined with management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel, freight, fleet and logistics. Excluding acquisitions, the Company’s headcount at December 31, 2012 decreased by approximately
1% from 2011. These expense initiatives have served to further improve the Company’s cost structure. Depreciation and amortization expense was $98 million in 2012, an increase of $9 million or 11% from 2011. This increase primarily relates to
the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $8 million in 2012, down $5 million or 40% from $13 million in 2011.


Index to Financial Statements

Total share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011 was $12.6 million, $10.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share-based compensation.

Non-Operating Expenses and Income

Non-operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $27 million in 2013, $20 million in 2012 and $27 million in 2011. The $7 million increase in interest expense in 2013 is due
to higher debt levels incurred for the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition. In November 2013, the Company renewed certain debt at a favorable interest rate and although the renewal did not materially reduce interest expense in 2013, the new interest rate
will save approximately $4 million in annual interest expense beginning in 2014. In 2012, the Company benefited from an improved interest rate on certain long-term debt, effective November 2011, which reduced interest expense by $7 million from the
prior year.

In “Other”, the net benefit of interest income, equity method investment income and noncontrolling
interests in 2013 was $13 million, a decrease of $3 million from 2012. These items had increased to $16 million in 2012, up approximately $8 million from 2011. This increase reflects the Company’s equity income recorded in 2012 for its 30%
investment interest in GPC Asia Pacific.

Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes was $1.0 billion in 2013, an increase of 2.5% from 2012. As a percentage of net sales, income before
income taxes was 7.4% in 2013 compared to 7.8% in 2012. In 2012, income before income taxes of $1.0 billion was up 14% from $891 million in 2011 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.8%, an increase from 7.1% in 2011.

Automotive Group

Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, was steady with the prior year at 8.6%. The changes in gross profit and operating costs as a
percentage of net sales, which related primarily to the acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific, were relatively neutral to operating profit during the year. Looking forward, Automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to
improve its operating margin in the years ahead.

Automotive’s operating margin increased to 8.6% in 2012 from 7.7% in
2011. The improvement in operating margin for 2012 is attributed primarily to effective cost controls and cost reductions implemented during the year. A slight increase in gross margin also positively impacted the operating margin.

Industrial Group

Industrial’s operating margin decreased to 7.2% in 2013 from 7.9% in 2012. The decrease in operating margin in 2013 is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with the slight
decrease in sales relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year. These items were partially offset by effective cost control measures. Industrial has made several recent acquisitions which will positively impact this
segment and will continue to focus on its many sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead.

Industrial’s operating margin decreased to 7.9% in 2012 from 8.1% in 2011. The decrease in operating margin in 2012 is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with slower sales
growth relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year. These items were partially offset by effective cost control measures.

Office Group

Office’s operating margin decreased to 7.5% in 2013 from
8.0% in 2012, primarily related to the reduced expense leverage associated with the decrease in sales for this segment relative to 2012. Previously, the operating margin at Office was relatively steady over the last few years, at 8.0% in 2012 and
7.9% in 2011. In each of these


Index to Financial Statements

periods, the cost savings measures in the Office segment were somewhat offset by the ongoing gross margin pressures associated with the slow demand for office products across the industry. Office
will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead.

Electrical/Electronic Group

Electrical/Electronic’s operating margin decreased to 8.4% in 2013 from 8.7% in 2012. The slight decline in operating margin is primarily due loss of expense leverage associated with the sales
decrease for this segment in 2013 relative to 2012. Electrical/Electronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to improve its operating margin in the years ahead.

Electrical/Electronic’s operating margin increased to 8.7% in 2012 from 7.3% in 2011. The increase in operating margin in 2012 is
primarily due to the positive impact of effective cost management as well as an improved gross margin. The improvement in gross margin reflects several factors, including higher margin business associated with recent acquisitions, and the decrease
in copper prices during the year, which generally do not affect profit dollars, but positively impact margins, as the standard industry practice is to bill copper to the customer at cost.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate of 34.4% in 2013 was down from 36.4% in 2012. The decrease reflects the favorable impact of a lower Australian tax rate applied to the pre-tax earnings of GPC Asia Pacific,
as well as the favorable tax rate applied to the one-time acquisition gain recorded in the second quarter of 2013. The income tax rate of 36.4% in 2012 was down slightly from 36.6% in 2011, primarily due to the favorable impact of a retirement asset
valuation adjustment in 2012 relative to 2011.

Net Income

Net income was $685 million in 2013, an increase of 6% from $648 million in 2012. On a per share diluted basis, net income was
$4.40 in 2013 compared to $4.14 in 2012, up 6%. Net income in 2013 was 4.9% of net sales compared to 5.0% of net sales in 2012.

In connection with the acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific, the Company recorded one-time positive purchase accounting adjustments of $33
million or $0.21 per diluted share in 2013.

Net income was $648 million in 2012, an increase of 15% from
$565 million in 2011. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.14 in 2012 compared to $3.58 in 2011, up 16%. Net income in 2012 was 5.0% of net sales compared to 4.5% of net sales in 2011.

In December 2012, the Company’s U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of December 31, 2013. The
Company recorded a one-time noncash curtailment gain of $23.5 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with this amendment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our cash balance of $197 million at
December 31, 2013 reflects a decrease of 51% compared to our cash balance of $403 million at December 31, 2012. In 2013, record levels of cash from operations provided by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management
was offset by approximately $712 million used for the acquisition of businesses and other investing activities. The Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2013 increased by approximately 12% from the prior year, which is
less than the Company’s 13% sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2013. Inventory at December 31, 2013 was up by approximately 13% from December 31, 2012, which is primarily attributable to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions,
inventory was up by approximately 1% from the prior year. Accounts payable increased $588 million or approximately 35% from December 31, 2012 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the impact of the GPC Asia
Pacific acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $492 million and $300, respectively, from December 31, 2012 due to the Company’s acquisitions during the year, primarily GPC Asia Pacific. The change in our
December 31, 2013 balances for deferred tax assets, down $182 million, and pension


Index to Financial Statements

and other post-retirement benefits liabilities, down $433 million, from December 31, 2012, is primarily due to a change in funded status of the Company’s pension plans in 2013.
Finally, the change in our December 31, 2013 balance for other assets, down $241 million or 38%, is primarily due to the purchase of the remaining 70% interest in GPC Asia Pacific in 2013. Previously, the Company accounted for the 30%
investment under the equity method of accounting, which was included in other assets in 2012.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by
private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $765 million of total debt outstanding at December 31, 2013, of which $250 million matures in November 2016 and $250 million matures in December 2023. In addition, the
Company entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Syndicated Facility”) for $850 million in September 2012, which replaced the $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in December 2012.
$265 million was outstanding under the Syndicated Facility or line of credit at December 31, 2013 and no amount was outstanding at December 31, 2012. Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term
sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share
repurchases and contemplated acquisitions.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.6 to 1 at
December 31, 2013 and this compares to 1.9 to 1 at December 31, 2012. Our liquidity position remains solid. The Company’s total debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 is up $265 million or 53% from December 31, 2012 and
primarily relates to the incremental borrowings utilized for the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition.

Sources and Uses of
Net Cash

A summary of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows:

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

The Company continues to generate cash and in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.1 billion. This reflects a 17%
increase from 2012 as, collectively, trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable net to a $278 million source of cash in 2013 compared to a $208 million source of cash in 2012. Additionally, net income and
depreciation and amortization in 2013 increased by $37 million and $36 million, respectively, from 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities was $906 million in 2012, a 45% increase from 2011, as, collectively, trade accounts receivable,
merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a $208 million source of cash in 2012 compared to a $19 million use of cash in 2011. Additionally, net income in 2012 increased by $83 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash flow used in investing activities was $826 million in 2013 compared to $652 million in 2012, an increase of 27%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities
in 2013 was $712 million, as previously discussed, or $154 million greater than in 2012. Capital expenditures of $124 million in 2013 increased by $22 million or 22% from 2012, but were within our estimate of $115 to $135 million, and we estimate
that cash used for capital expenditures in 2014 will be approximately $140 to $160 million. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $652 million in 2012 compared to $231 million in 2011, an increase of 182%.


Index to Financial Statements

Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2012 was $558 million, as previously discussed, or $421 million greater than in 2011. Capital expenditures of $102
million in 2012 were relatively consistent with 2011.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:

The Company used $425 million of cash in financing activities in 2013, up 12% from the $379 million used in financing activities
in 2012. Cash used in financing activities in 2012 was down $15 million or 4% from the $394 million used in 2011. For the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases
of the Company’s common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $326 million, $301 million and $276 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue
in the foreseeable future. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company repurchased $121 million, $82 million and $122 million, respectively, of the Company’s common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program,
but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary.

Notes and Other Borrowings

The Company maintains an $850 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures
in September 2017 and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the Company’s leverage ratio (0.92% at December 31, 2013). The Company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional $350
million, as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the Syndicated Facility with appropriate notice. At December 31, 2013, approximately $265 million was outstanding under this line of credit. No amounts were
outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2012. Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $62 million and $61
million outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

At December 31, 2013, the Company had unsecured
Senior Notes outstanding under financing arrangements as follows: $250 million series D and E senior unsecured notes, 3.35% fixed, due 2016; and $250 million series F senior unsecured notes, 2.99% fixed, due 2023. These borrowings contain
covenants related to a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Company’s
total outstanding borrowings was approximately 2.82% at December 31, 2013 and 4.01% at December 31, 2012. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $24.3 million, $19.6 million and $24.6 million
in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Contractual and Other Obligations

The following table shows the Company’s approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make
future payments under specified contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013:

Contractual
Obligations

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized
tax benefits at December 31, 2013, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of


Index to Financial Statements

cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $60 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to
Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes.

Purchase orders or contracts for the
purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations
to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory
or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

The Company guarantees the
borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result
of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and
affiliates’ borrowings. The following table shows the Company’s approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013:

Other Commercial Commitments

In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions
to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2013 were $74 million. We expect to make a $51 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2014, and contributions required for 2014 and future years will depend on a
number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations.

Share Repurchases

In 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 10.7 million shares at December 31, 2013.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to


Index to Financial Statements

be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting
estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories — Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these
loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe
its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts — Methodology

The Company
evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this
estimate when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer
base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of $8.7 million, $8.0 million, and $13.2 million, respectively.

Consideration Received from Vendors

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon
achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the
end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2014 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we
will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives.

Impairment of Property,
Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors.
Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash
flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Company’s pension plan assets. The
pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary
standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and
pro-


Index to Financial Statements

vide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return. The Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to
generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (49% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 8% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, 5% DJ Global Moderate Index and 28% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the
most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns
and turnover rates.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based
on the Company’s asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2014 pension expense or income is 7.85% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for
the approximate duration of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.

The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market
conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our
discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 5.10% at December 31, 2013.

Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $51.1 million, $26.8 million and $32.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The increase in pension cost in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the curtailment gain recorded in connection with the 2012 amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Such curtailment gain, net of the change in assumptions for the rate of
return on plan assets and discount rate, also accounts for the decrease in pension cost in 2012 from 2011. The 2012 amendment and related curtailment decreased benefit costs in 2012 and are discussed further below. Refer to Note 7 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.

In December 2012, the Company’s
U.S. defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of December 31, 2013. No further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of
December 31, 2013. The Company recorded a $23.5 million non-cash curtailment gain in December 2012 in connection with this amendment.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:


Index to Financial Statements

We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete
period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share.

The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Specifically, the Company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments (including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) method), customer sales returns, and volume incentives earned, among others. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing
levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book-to-physical inventory adjustment and LIFO valuation. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions
for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year-end. The effect of these adjustments in 2013 and 2012 was not significant.

ITEM 7A

.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

.

Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in
foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.

Foreign Currency

The Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating
unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. The Company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, the functional currency of our Canadian operations,
and the Australian dollar, the functional currency of our Australasian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Canadian and Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, negatively impacted our
results for the year ended December 31, 2013.

During 2013 and 2012, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates
between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $255 million and $176 million, respectively.

Management’s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO
and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Report of Management

Genuine Parts Company

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related information included herein for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The opinion of Ernst & Young
LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, on those consolidated financial statements is included herein. The primary responsibility for the integrity of the financial information included in this annual report rests with
management. Such information was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances based on our best estimates and judgments and giving due consideration to materiality.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company’s internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company’s published consolidated financial statements. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

i. pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

iii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management did not include the internal
controls of GPC Asia Pacific, which was acquired on April 1, 2013, and is included in the Company’s 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013.

In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the Company’s operating effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. This report appears on page F-3.

Audit Committee Responsibility

The Audit Committee of Genuine Parts Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s
financial reports and accounting practices to ascertain that they are within acceptable limits of sound practice in such matters. The membership of the Committee consists of non-employee Directors. At periodic meetings, the Audit Committee discusses
audit and financial reporting matters and the internal audit function with representatives of financial management and with representatives from Ernst & Young LLP.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

We have audited Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries’ management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting section of the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of GPC Asia Pacific, which is included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements of Genuine Parts Company and constituted
approximately 16% of total assets and approximately 23% of net assets, as of December 31, 2013 and constituted 6% of revenues and less than 1% of net income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
Genuine Parts Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over the financial reporting of this entity.

In our opinion, Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income and
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Financial
Statements

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and
2012, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Genuine Parts Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company) is a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products, and
electrical/electronic materials. The Company serves a diverse customer base through approximately 2,600 locations in North America and Australasia and, therefore, has limited exposure from credit losses to any particular customer, region, or
industry segment. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were
issued.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is not material to the Company’s consolidated net income.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the Company’s price to the customer is fixed and determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership.

Foreign Currency Translation

The consolidated balance sheets and
statements of income and comprehensive income of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates, respectively. The foreign currency translation adjustment is included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.

Trade Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The Company estimates an
allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations
(e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the
Company operates could result in higher than

expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of
approximately $8,691,000, $8,047,000, and $13,248,000, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $14,423,000 and $19,180,000, respectively.

Merchandise Inventories, Including Consideration Received From Vendors

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a
majority of automotive parts, electrical/electronic materials, and industrial parts, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for office products and certain other inventories. If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories, cost would
have been approximately $432,150,000 and $428,260,000 higher than reported at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During 2013, 2012, and 2011 reductions in inventory levels in automotive parts inventories (2013 and 2012), industrial parts
inventories (2013, 2012, and 2011), and electrical parts inventories (2012 and 2011) resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers. The effect of the LIFO liquidation in 2013, 2012, and 2011 was to reduce cost of goods sold by approximately
$5,000,000, $6,000,000, and $16,000,000, respectively.

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and
estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor
return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives.
Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of
inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2014 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to
provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses and amounts due from vendors.

Goodwill

The Company reviews its goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The present value of future cash flows approach was
used to determine any potential impairment. The Company determined that goodwill was not impaired and, therefore, no impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, or 2011. If an impairment occurs at a future date, it
may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the Company’s earnings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Other Assets

Other assets are comprised of the following:

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is primarily determined on a straight-line basis over the
following estimated useful life of each asset: buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill

The Company assesses its
long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the
remaining life of such assets. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. Impairment losses, if any, are measured
based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.

Other Long-Term Liabilities

Other long-term liabilities are comprised of the following:

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority of group health insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the Company’s
claims admin-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

istrators. These reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.

Long-term insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the workers’ compensation program. In addition, the Company carries
various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. The Company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The
analysis calculates development factors, which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program. While the Company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are
appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Accumulated other
comprehensive loss is comprised of the following:

The following table presents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by component for
the year ended December 31, 2013:

The accumulated other comprehensive loss components related to the pension benefits are included in the
computation of net periodic benefit cost in the employee benefit plans footnote.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts
receivable and trade accounts payable approximate their respective fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of fixed rate debt was approximately $496,000,000 and
$516,000,000, respectively. The fair value of fixed rate debt is designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., significant observable inputs) and is based primarily on the discounted value of future cash flows using current market
interest rates offered for debt of similar credit risk and maturity.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are classified as selling, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income and comprehensive income and totaled approximately $250,000,000, $220,000,000, and $190,000,000, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $57,900,000, $43,200,000, and $45,100,000 in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Accounting for Legal Costs

The Company’s legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as such costs are incurred.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company maintains various long-term incentive plans, which provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance
awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
date of exercise over the base value of the grant. The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs represent a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common
stock at a future date. The majority of awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods ranging from one to five years and are expensed accordingly on a straight-line basis. The Company issues new shares upon exercise or conversion of
awards under these plans.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. The computation of diluted net income per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and nonvested restricted stock awards options. Options to purchase approximately 630,000, 730,000, and
850,000 shares of common stock ranging from $54 — $81 per share were outstanding at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per common share because the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of common stock in each respective year.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting
period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current
requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. ASU 2013-02 is effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Credit Facilities

The principal amounts of the Company’s borrowings subject to variable rates totaled approximately $264,658,000 at
December 31, 2013. There were no amounts subject to variable rates at December 31, 2012. The weighted average interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 2.82% at December 31, 2013 and 4.01% at
December 31, 2012.

The Company maintains an $850,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of
financial institutions that matures in September 2017 and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the Company’s leverage ratio (0.92% at December 31, 2013). The Company also has the option under this agreement to
increase its borrowing an additional $350,000,000, as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the Syndicated Facility with appropriate notice. At December 31, 2013, approximately $264,658,000 was outstanding under this
line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2012.

Certain borrowings require
the Company to comply with a financial covenant with respect to a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance
reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of $61,617,000 and $61,119,000 outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Amounts outstanding under the Company’s credit facilities consist of the following:

Share-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2013, total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately
$26,000,000. The weighted-average period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately three years. The aggregate intrinsic value for options and RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately
$154,000,000 and $90,300,000, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options and RSUs vested totaled approximately $93,600,000 and $57,600,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average
contractual life for outstanding and exercisable options and RSUs was six and five years, respectively. Share-based compensation cost of $12,648,000, $10,747,000, and $7,547,000, was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for share-based compensation arrangements was approximately $5,100,000, $4,300,000, and $3,000,000, for 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively. There have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.

For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 the fair value for options and SARs granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 2.0%, 2.0%, and 3.6%; dividend yield of 3.2%, 3.3%, and 3.8%; annual historical volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company’s common stock of 19% for each of the three
years; an average expected life and estimated turnover based on the historical pattern of existing grants of approximately seven years and 5.0%, respectively. The fair value of RSUs is based on the price of the Company’s stock on the date of
grant. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, was $8,100,000, $6,700,000, and $7,200,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $552,000,000 of cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is considered to be
indefinitely reinvested. As such, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon, and it is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability. Significant components of the
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The current portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and income taxes payable, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.

The components of income before
income taxes are as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The components of income tax expense are as follows:

The reasons for the difference between total tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory
Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes are as follows:

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various
states, and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009 or subject to non-United States income tax examinations for years
ended prior to 2002. The Company is currently under audit in the United States and Canada. Some audits may conclude in the next twelve months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement
amounts. It is not possible to estimate the effect, if any, of the amount of such change during the next twelve months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. However, the Company does not anticipate total
unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change during the year due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

F-19

Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The amount of gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and
penalties, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $59,530,000 and $58,020,000, respectively, of which approximately $18,287,000 and $17,615,000, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. During the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company paid interest and penalties of approximately $405,000, $493,000, and $759,000, respectively. The Company had approximately $12,340,000 and $12,565,000 of accrued interest and penalties at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

7.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s defined benefit pension plans cover employees in the U.S. and Canada who meet eligibility
requirements. The plan covering U.S. employees is noncontributory and benefits are based on the employees’ compensation during the highest five of their last ten years of credited service. The Canadian plan is contributory and benefits are
based on career average compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute an amount equal to the minimum required contribution under applicable pension legislation. The Company may increase its contribution above the minimum if
appropriate to its tax and cash position and the plans’ funded position.

In December 2012, the U.S. defined benefit plan
was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of December 31, 2013. Therefore, no further benefit accruals were provided after that date for additional credited service or earnings. In addition, all participants will became fully vested as of
December 31, 2013. The Company recognized a one-time noncash curtailment gain in 2012 of $23,507,000 in connection with this amendment.

The Company also sponsors supplemental retirement plans covering employees in the U.S. and Canada. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension plans.

Changes in benefit obligations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were:

The benefit obligations for the Company’s U.S. pension plans included in the above
were $1,838,810,000 and $1,955,414,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total accumulated benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans was approximately $2,017,619,000 and $2,112,134,000 at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and
strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the funds. The pension plan strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension
legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plans are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from
erosion of purchasing power, and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rates of return. The Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return
in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (49% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 8% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, 5% DJ Global Moderate Index, and 28% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

The fair values of the plan assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, by asset category, are shown in the tables below. Various inputs
are considered when determining the value of the Company’s pension plan assets.

F-21

Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. Level 1 represents observable market
inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 represents other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.). Level 3
represents significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

The valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting
date. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded on the last day of the calendar plan year. Debt securities including corporate bonds, U.S. Government securities, and
asset-backed securities are valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for an investment as of the last day of the calendar plan year.

Equity securities include Genuine Parts Company common stock in the amounts of $167,788,000 (8.7% of total
plan assets) and $128,236,000 (8.0% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Dividend payments received by the plan on Company stock totaled approximately $4,336,000 and $3,994,000 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Fees
paid during the year for services rendered by parties in interest were based on customary and reasonable rates for such services.

The changes in the fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2013 and 2012 were not material.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s asset
allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2014 pension cost or income is 7.85% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the
Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.

The Company has two defined contribution plans that cover substantially all of its domestic employees. The
Company’s matching contributions are determined based on the employee’s participation in the U.S. pension plan. Prior to 2014, U.S. pension plan participants who continue earning credited service after 2008 receive a matching contribution
of 20% of the first 6% of the employee’s salary. Other employees receive a matching contribution of 100% of the first 5% of the employee’s salary. In December 2012, the Company approved an amendment to merge the two plans effective
January 1, 2014. Beginning in 2014, all employees will receive a matching contribution of 100% of the first 5% of the employees’ salary. Total plan expense for both plans was approximately $43,236,000 in 2013, $43,155,000 in 2012, and
$38,773,000 in 2011.

Guarantees

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and
certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). Presently, the independents are generally consolidated by unaffiliated enterprises that have a controlling financial interest through
ownership of a majority voting interest in the independent. The Company has no voting interest or other equity conversion rights in any of the independents. The Company does not control the independents or the affiliates, but receives a fee for the
guarantee. The Company has concluded that the independents are variable interest entities, but that the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Specifically, the equity holders of the independents have the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance including, but not limited to, decisions about hiring and terminating personnel, local marketing and promotional initiatives, pricing and selling activities, credit decisions, monitoring
and maintaining

F-25

Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

appropriate inventories, and store hours. Separately, the Company concluded the affiliates are not variable interest entities. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. While such borrowings of the independents and affiliates are outstanding, the Company is required to maintain
compliance with certain covenants, including a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

At December 31, 2013, the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the Company were approximately
$258,703,000. These loans generally mature over periods from one to six years. In the event that the Company is required to make payments in connection with guaranteed obligations of the independents or the affiliates, the Company would obtain and
liquidate certain collateral (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory) to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee. When it is deemed probable that the Company will incur a loss in connection with a guarantee, a liability is
recorded equal to this estimated loss. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings.

The Company has accrued for guarantees related to the independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. These liabilities are not material to the financial position
of the Company and are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

9.

Acquisitions

During 2013, the Company acquired one company each in the Automotive Group (including GPC Asia Pacific), Industrial
Group, and Electrical/Electronic Materials Group for approximately $650,000,000, net of cash acquired. During 2012, the Company acquired one company in the Automotive Group (Quaker City Motor Parts Co.) for approximately $343,000,000, net of cash
acquired. During 2011, the Company acquired three companies in the Industrial Group and one company in the Electrical/Electronic Materials Group for approximately $115,600,000.

For each acquisition, the Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of their respective acquisition dates. The results of
operations for the acquired companies were included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income beginning on their respective acquisition dates. The Company recorded approximately $950,000,000, $230,000,000 and
$78,210,000 of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the 2013, 2012, and 2011 acquisitions, respectively.

For
the 2013 acquisitions, other intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships of $235,000,000, trademarks of $141,000,000, and non-competition agreements of $4,000,000 with weighted average amortization lives of 15, 40, and 1 years,
respectively. For the 2012 acquisitions, other intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships of $108,000,000 and trademarks of $2,000,000, with weighted average amortization lives of 15 and 40 years, respectively. For the 2011
acquisitions, other intangible assets acquired consisted of customer relationships of $37,378,000, trademarks of $12,100,000, and non-competition agreements of $650,000, with weighted average amortization lives of 15, 40, and 5 years, respectively.

Additional disclosures on the 2013 automotive acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific and the 2012 automotive acquisition of Quaker
City Motor Parts Co. are provided below.

GPC Asia Pacific

The Company acquired a 30% investment in GPC Asia Pacific, formerly known as the Exego Group, for approximately $166,000,000 effective
January 1, 2012. On April 1, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 70% interest in GPC Asia Pacific for approximately $590,000,000, net of cash acquired of $70,000,000, and the

F-26

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

assumption of approximately $230,000,000 in debt. The acquisition was financed using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities. GPC Asia Pacific, which is
headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, is a leading aftermarket distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in Australasia, with annual revenues of approximately $1,100,000,000 and a company-owned store footprint of more than 460
locations across Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition provides an opportunity for the Company to participate in the ongoing and significant growth opportunities in the Australasian aftermarket.

The Company recognized certain one-time positive purchase accounting pre-tax adjustments of approximately $33,000,000, or $0.21 net of
taxes on a per share diluted basis, as a result of the acquisition. The net one-time purchase accounting adjustments consisted of a gain of approximately $59,000,000 related to remeasuring the 30% investment in GPC Asia Pacific held before the
business combination to fair value, the post-closing sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value of $21,000,000 as part of the purchase price allocation, and certain negative adjustments of approximately $5,000,000.

Prior to the 70% acquisition, the Company accounted for the 30% investment under the equity method of accounting. The acquisition-date
fair value of the 30% investment was approximately $234,000,000 and is included in the measurement of the consideration transferred. The difference between the acquisition-date fair value and the carrying amount of the equity method investment
resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately $59,000,000 on the acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value was determined using a market and income approach with the assistance of a third party valuation firm.

As part of the allocation of purchase price described below, acquired inventory was written up to fair value, which was approximately
$21,000,000 above the cost of the acquired inventory. Based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories, the entire write-up was recognized in cost of goods sold during 2013.

The net $54,000,000 of one-time gain and other adjustments are included in the line item “Selling, administrative & other
expenses” and the acquired inventory adjustment of $21,000,000 is included in “Cost of goods sold” in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled approximately $824,000,000, net of cash acquired of $70,000,000,
which consisted of the following:

F-27

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company is in the process of analyzing the estimated values of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date and is obtaining third-party valuations of certain intangible assets. The
allocation of the purchase price is therefore preliminary and subject to revision.

The acquired intangible assets of approximately $347,000,000 were provisionally assigned to customer
relationships of $202,000,000, trademarks of $141,000,000, and non-compete agreements of $4,000,000, with weighted average amortization lives of 16, 40, and 1 year, respectively, for a total weighted average amortization life of 26 years. The fair
value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets is provisional pending completion of the final valuations for these assets.

The estimated goodwill recognized as part of the acquisition is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the automotive segment. The
goodwill is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of GPC Asia Pacific.

The amounts of net
sales and earnings of GPC Asia Pacific included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from April 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 were approximately $839,000,000 in net sales and net income of $0.43
on a per share diluted basis, respectively.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
of the Company as if GPC Asia Pacific had been included in the consolidated results of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 would be estimated at $14,400,000,000 and $14,100,000,000 in net sales, respectively, and net
income of $4.42 and $4.53 on a per share diluted basis, respectively. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction actually occurred at the beginning of these
periods, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

The adjustments to the pro forma amounts include, but are not
limited to, applying the Company’s accounting policies, amortization related to fair value adjustments to intangible assets, one-time purchase accounting adjustments, interest expense on acquisition related debt, and any associated tax effects.
