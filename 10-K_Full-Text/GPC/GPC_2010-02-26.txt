AUTOMOTIVE
    PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
    distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items.
    The Company is the largest member, with approximately 95%
    ownership, of the National Automotive Parts Association
    (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925
    to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In
    addition to over 400,000 available part numbers, the Company, in
    conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
    marketing, training and other programs in the automotive
    aftermarket.

During 2009, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included
    NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts
    stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores”) owned and operated in the United States by the
    Company; NAPA and Traction automotive parts distribution centers
    and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and
    operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA
    Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company;
    auto parts stores and distribution centers in the United States
    operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a
    noncontrolling or controlling interest; auto parts stores in
    Canada operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50%
    interest; import automotive parts distribution centers in the
    United States owned by the Company and operated by its Altrom
    America division; import automotive parts distribution centers
    in Canada owned and operated by Altrom Canada Corporation
    (“Altrom Canada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company; distribution centers in the United States owned by
    Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the Company; rebuilding and distribution plants in the United
    States owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division;
    and automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts
    stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company.



The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information
    (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC
    is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information
    company with over 40,000 North American subscribers linked to
    its services and information databases. MRIC’s core
    product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic
    repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers
    distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for
    substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in
    the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs,
    buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
    addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small
    engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The
    Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such
    vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety
    of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair
    shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck
    dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass
    merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who
    perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although
    the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from
    more than 90 different suppliers, approximately 52% of 2009
    automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major
    suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
    inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

.

In 2009, the
    Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution
    centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,000
    domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in
    43 states. At December 31, 2009, Genuine Parts Company
    owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in two
    corporations, which operated approximately 19 auto parts stores
    in two states, and a subsidiary corporation operating three
    distribution centers in three states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the
    distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories
    for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs
    approximately 3,600 people and operates a network of 12
    distribution centers supplying approximately 588 NAPA stores and
    104 Traction wholesalers. Traction is a supplier of parts to
    small and large fleet owners and operators and, together with
    NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining and
    forestry industries. These include approximately
    208 company owned stores, 25 joint venture or progressive
    owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and
    approximately 459 independently owned stores. NAPA and Traction
    operations supply bannered installers and independent installers
    in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service
    station and repair shops operating under the banners of national
    accounts. UAP is a licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Canada.

In Canada, Altrom Canada Corp. operates 15 import automotive
    parts distribution centers. In the United States, Altrom America
    operates two import automotive parts distribution centers.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates nine distribution
    centers, four auto parts stores and four tire centers. Auto Todo
    is a licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve
    approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores
    located throughout the market areas served in the United States.
    NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of
    customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these
    independent automotive parts stores account for approximately
    26% of the Company’s total sales with no automotive parts
    store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or
    common ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total
    sales of the Company.

Products

.

Distribution centers have
    access to over 400,000 different parts and related supply items.
    Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and
    accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide
    for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are
    filled and shipped the same day as received. The majority of
    sales are on terms that require payment within 30 days of
    the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the
    products it distributes. The majority of products are
    distributed under the
    NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA. Traction sales
    also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a
    proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck
    market.

Related Operations

.

In 2009, the
    Company increased its ownership interest in Balkamp from 89.6%
    to 100%. Balkamp distributes a wide variety of replacement parts
    and accessory items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles,
    motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes
    service items such as testing



equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies,
    chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms
    and institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 45,000 products,
    which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that
    are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are
    categorized into over 230 different product groups purchased
    from approximately 600 domestic suppliers and 100 foreign
    manufacturers. In addition, Balkamp operates two Redistribution
    Centers that provide NAPA with over 1,200 SKUs of oils,
    chemicals and procurement items.
    BALKAMP

    a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and
    marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has
    four distribution centers located in Indianapolis and
    Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi and West Jordan,
    Utah.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates three
    facilities where certain small automotive parts are rebuilt or
    distributed to the members of NAPA under the
    NAPA

®

brand name.
    Rayloc

®

is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW
    Distribution, with one warehouse location in Atlanta, Georgia,
    which serves 24 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores, of which 16
    are owned and located in the United States. This group
    distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and
    direct to small fleet owners and operators.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2009, sales from the Automotive Parts Group
    were approximately 52% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 48% in 2008 and 49% in 2007. For additional segment
    information, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

page F-1.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

.

The
    Company believes that the quality and the range of services
    provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
    significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution
    system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
    obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of
    electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment
    through a continuing parts classification system which allows
    independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain
    merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA
    AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing
    aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost
    analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement
    benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars,
    sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of
    sale/inventory management is available through
    TAMS

®

(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system
    designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined
    an inventory classification system to determine optimum
    distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
    automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations,
    usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and
    other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
    analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s
    inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature
    of the inventory management services that the Company makes
    available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last
    10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been
    insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful
    operation of its classification system, which involves product
    return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

.

The automotive parts
    distribution business is highly competitive. The Company
    competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell
    replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as
    well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers,
    warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In
    addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of
    parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers,
    including national retail chains, and with other parts
    distributors and retailers. Further information regarding
    competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the
    Industries in Which We Do Business.”

NAPA

.

The Company is a member of the
    National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary association
    formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive
    replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
    parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2009
    operated 64 distribution centers located throughout the United
    States, 58 of which were owned and operated by the Company. NAPA
    develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its
    members. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.



Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and
    distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised
    and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not
    required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so
    designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from
    other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally
    registered trademark
    NAPA

®

as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
    parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national
    advertising program, which is designed to increase public
    recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and
    NAPA itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District
    Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
    decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust
    laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
    manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of
    territories among several NAPA members, fixing of prices or
    terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements
    to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or
    determining the number and location of, or arrangements with,
    auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL
    PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group, operated as Motion Industries, Inc.
    (“Motion”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion distributes
    MRO (maintenance, repair, and operation) industrial replacement
    parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical power
    transmission, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and
    pneumatic components, industrial supplies and material handling
    products throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries
    (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”) and the Mexican
    market is served by Motion Mexico S de RL de CV (“Motion
    Mexico”). Both organizations operate in the Company’s
    North American structure

In 2009, the Company acquired General Tool and Supply with six
    locations and it is a supplier of industrial parts and supplies
    in the United States.

As of December 31, 2009, the Industrial Parts Group served
    more than 120,000 customers in all types of industries located
    throughout North America, including the food, forest products,
    primary metal, paper, mining, automotive, petrochemical and
    pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted
    specialty industries such as power generation, wastewater
    treatment facilities, wind power generation, solar power,
    government projects, pipelines, railroad, ports, and others.
    Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with
    access to a database of 4.1 million parts.

This group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies,
    achieved through inventory management and logistical solutions
    coupled with Motion Industries’ vast product knowledge and
    system capabilities. The Company meets the MRO demand of a large
    and fragmented market with high levels of service in the areas
    of asset management, inventory and logistics management, product
    application and utilization management processes. A highly
    developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and customer
    connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading

e-business

capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides
    integration between the Company’s information technology
    network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits
    for both the supplier and customer.

Distribution System

.

In North America,
    the Industrial Parts Group operates 458 branches, 7 distribution
    centers and 36 service centers as of December 31, 2009. The
    distribution centers stock and distribute more than 80,000
    different items purchased from more than 460 different
    suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and
    mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 38% of 2009
    total industrial product purchases were made from 10 major
    suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts
    Group’s branches located in 47 states, Puerto Rico,
    nine provinces in Canada, and Mexico. Each branch has warehouse
    facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory
    representative of the products used by customers in the
    respective market area served.

Products

.

The Industrial Parts Group
    distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its
    customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and
    operate plants, machinery and equipment. Products include such
    items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains,
    gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and



industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its
    offering to include systems and automation products in response
    to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process
    automation for full systems integration of plant equipment.
    Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to
    opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient
    product markets, leading to product offerings such as
    energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and
    environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this
    group’s business demands the maintenance of adequate
    inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery
    requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are
    installed by the customer or used in plant and facility
    maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from
    existing stock and deliveries are normally made within
    24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are
    on open account.

Supply Agreements

.

Non-exclusive
    distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial
    Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements
    vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial
    Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such
    agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until
    terminated by mutual consent. The Company has return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
    inventory obsolescence.

Additionally, Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with
    existing customers that represent approximately 40% of the
    annual sales volume.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2009, sales from the Company’s Industrial
    Parts Group approximated 29% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 32% in 2008 and 31% in 2007. For additional segment
    information, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

page F-1.

Competition

.

The industrial parts
    distribution business is highly competitive. The Industrial
    Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the
    distribution of such items, general line distributors and others
    who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial
    Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to
    the customer. Further information regarding competition in the
    industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the
    Industries in Which We Do Business.”

OFFICE
    PRODUCTS GROUP

The Office Products Group, operated through S. P. Richards
    Company (“S. P. Richards”), a wholly owned subsidiary
    of the Company, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. S. P.
    Richards is engaged in the wholesale distribution of a broad
    line of office and other business related products that are used
    in the daily operation of businesses, schools, offices and
    institutions. Office products fall into the general categories
    of computer supplies, imaging products, office furniture, office
    machines, general office products, school supplies, cleaning and
    breakroom supplies, and healthcare products.

The Office Products Group is represented in Canada through S. P.
    Richards Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and
    is headquartered near Toronto, Ontario. S. P. Richards Canada
    services office product resellers throughout Canada from
    locations in Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg.

Distribution System

.

The Office
    Products Group distributes more than 50,000 items to nearly
    6,000 business product resellers throughout the United States
    and Canada from a network of 43 distribution centers. The 2008
    acquisition of Action/Emco Wholesale allowed for the
    consolidation of the Detroit facility into the larger, more
    state of the art facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Company
    also eliminated operational expenses by closing its Hartford
    distribution center. This was achieved by incorporating the
    business serviced out of the facility into the New York and
    Boston distribution centers. In 2009, the Company accelerated
    the installation of new pick to voice technology in its
    distribution centers and will have largely completed that
    rollout by year end 2010. This network of strategically located
    distribution centers provides overnight delivery of the
    Company’s comprehensive product offering. Approximately 45%
    of the Company’s 2009 total office products purchases were
    made from 10 major suppliers.

The Office Products Group sells strictly to resellers of office
    products. These resellers include independently owned office
    product dealers, national office product superstores and mass
    merchants, large contract stationers, mail order companies,
    Internet resellers and college bookstores. Resellers are offered
    comprehensive marketing programs, which include print and
    electronic catalogs and flyers, electronic content for reseller
    websites, and education and training resources.

Competition

.

The office products
    distribution business is highly competitive. In the distribution
    of its product offering to resellers, S. P. Richards competes
    with many other wholesale distributors, as well as with certain
    manufacturers of office products. Further information regarding
    competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the
    Industries in Which We Do Business.”

ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC
    MATERIALS GROUP

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group was formed on
    July 1, 1998 through the acquisition of EIS, Inc.
    (“EIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
    headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. This Group distributes
    materials to more than 20,000 electrical and electronic
    manufacturers in North America. With 36 branch locations in the
    United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and
    Canada, this Group distributes over 100,000 items, from
    insulating and conductive materials to assembly tools and test
    equipment. EIS also has three manufacturing facilities that
    provide custom fabricated parts.

Distribution System

.

The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group provides distribution
    services to original equipment manufacturers, motor repair shops
    and assembly markets. EIS actively utilizes its

E-commerce

Internet site to present its products to customers while
    allowing these on-line visitors to conveniently purchase from a
    large product assortment.

Electrical and electronic products are distributed from
    warehouse locations in major user markets throughout the United
    States, as well as in Mexico and Canada. The Company has return
    privileges with some of its suppliers, which has protected the
    Company from inventory obsolescence.

Products

. The Electrical/Electronic Materials
    Group distributes a wide variety of products to customers from
    over 350 vendors. These products include custom fabricated
    flexible materials that are used as components within a
    customer’s manufactured finished product in a variety of
    market segments. Among the products distributed and fabricated
    are such items as magnet wire, conductive materials, insulating
    and shielding materials, assembly tools, test equipment,
    adhesives and chemicals, pressure sensitive tapes, solder,
    anti-static products and thermal management products. To meet
    the prompt delivery demands of its customers, this Group
    maintains large inventories. The majority of sales are on open
    account. Approximately 45% of 2009 total Electrical/Electronic
    Materials Group purchases were made from 10 major suppliers.

Integrated Supply

.

The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group’s integrated supply
    programs are a part of the marketing strategy, as a greater
    number of customers — especially national
    accounts — are given the opportunity



to participate in this low-cost, high-service capability. The
    Group developed AIMS (Advanced Inventory Management System), a
    totally integrated, highly automated solution for inventory
    management. The Group’s Integrated Supply offering also
    includes SupplyPro, an electronic vending dispenser used to
    eliminate costly tool cribs, or in-house stores, at customer
    warehouse facilities.

Segment Data

.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2009, sales from the Company’s
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group approximated 3% of the
    Company’s net sales, as compared to 4% in 2008 and 2007.
    For additional segment information, see Note 11 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements set forth beginning on

page F-1.

Competition

. The electrical and electronics
    distribution business is highly competitive. The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group competes with other
    distributors specializing in the distribution of electrical and
    electronic products, general line distributors and, to a lesser
    extent, manufacturers that sell directly to customers. Further
    information regarding competition in the industry is set forth
    in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face
    Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do
    Business.”

ITEM 1A

.

RISK
    FACTORS

.

Set forth below are some risks and uncertainties that, if they
    were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our
    business or could cause our actual results to differ materially
    from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
    in this report and in the other public statements we make. These
    risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are
    subject to include, but are not limited to, the risks of our
    businesses described elsewhere in this report.

We
    Depend On Our Relationships with Our Vendors, and a Disruption
    of Our Vendor Relationships or a Disruption in Our Vendors’
    Operations Could Harm Our Business

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial
    parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our
    business depends on developing and maintaining close and
    productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our
    vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many
    factors outside our control may harm our relationships with our
    vendors. For example, financial or operational difficulties with
    a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the
    products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also
    limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase
    products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these
    products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts, industrial
    parts or office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship
    with some vendors. In our automotive business, the number of
    vendors could decrease considerably, and the prices charged to
    us by the remaining vendors could increase, as vehicle
    production slows due to the decline in consumer spending and,
    possibly, the failure of one or more of the large automobile
    manufacturers. We would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors
    limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us
    from inventory obsolescence. A disruption of our vendor
    relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

Our
    Business Likely Will Continue To Be Impacted By Difficult
    Economic Conditions

Our business and results of operations may continue to be
    adversely impacted by difficult global, national and local
    economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer,
    commercial and industrial spending. These economic conditions
    began to significantly deteriorate in the fourth quarter of
    2008. Some of the factors that have contributed to reduced
    levels of spending include conditions in the residential real
    estate and mortgage markets, conditions in the automobile
    industry, variability in fuel and other energy costs, labor and
    healthcare costs, access to credit, high unemployment rates, low
    consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. These
    factors had a material adverse effect on demand for the
    Company’s products and services and on the Company’s
    financial condition and operating results in 2009. Continued
    recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses
    and business failures, which could result in a decrease in
    spending

and/or

our
    loss of certain small business and retail customers. In
    addition, continued distress in global credit markets, business
    failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material
    adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to meet our
    inventory demands. All of these macroeconomic conditions could
    adversely affect our sales growth, margins and overhead, which
    could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.



The current difficult economic climate has shown signs of
    stabilizing in recent months but is not expected to improve
    significantly in the near term. The resulting low levels of
    consumer, commercial and industrial spending could continue to
    result in weakened demand for the products of all of our
    business groups for the foreseeable future.

Our
    Business Will Be Adversely Affected If Demand for Our Products
    Slows

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we
    distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.

With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher
    vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
    manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance
    offered on new vehicles;

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old
    and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the
    original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more
    maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;

•

gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from
    using their vehicles;

•

changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely
    more on other transportation;

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair
    information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by
    governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all
    diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the
    vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and

•

the economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause
    consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer
    discretionary spending.

With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors
    are:

•

the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity
    utilization, as these indices impact the need for industrial
    replacement parts;

•

changes in the level of the Institute for Supply
    Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading
    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while
    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing
    economy; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our office products group, the primary factors
    are:

•

the level of unemployment especially as it relates to white
    collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for business
    products; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the
    primary factors are:

•

changes in the level of the Institute for Supply
    Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading
    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while
    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing
    economy; and

•

the economy in general.

We
    Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do
    Business

The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and
    electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many
    factors including name recognition, product availability,
    customer service, anticipating changing



customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures.
    Because we seek to offer competitive prices, if our competitors
    reduce their prices, we may be forced to reduce our prices,
    which could result in a material decline in our revenues and
    earnings. Increased competition among distributors of automotive
    and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials,
    including internet-related initiatives, could cause a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company
    anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four
    business segments in the foreseeable future.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is
    highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of
    competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional
    auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local
    automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that
    supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass
    merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products
    and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If
    we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive
    strategies, including internet related initiatives, or if our
    competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose
    customers and our sales and profits may decline.

The
    Impairment of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect
    Us

The capital and credit markets have experienced varying levels
    of volatility and disruption for more than two years. In late
    2008 and early 2009, volatility and disruptions reached
    unprecedented levels. We have exposure to counterparties with
    which we routinely execute transactions. Such counterparties
    include commercial banks, insurance companies, investment funds
    and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed
    to bankruptcy or liquidity risks. While we have not realized any
    significant losses to date, a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by
    one of our significant counterparties could materially and
    adversely affect our access to capital, future business and
    results of operations.

PROPERTIES

.

The Company’s headquarters and Automotive Parts Group
    headquarters are located in two adjacent office buildings owned
    by the Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group currently operates 58
    NAPA Distribution Centers in the United States distributed among
    eight geographic divisions. Approximately 90% of the
    distribution center properties are owned by the Company. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company operated approximately 1,000
    NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states, and the
    Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in
    approximately 19 additional auto parts stores and three
    distribution centers located in five states. Other than NAPA
    AUTO PARTS stores located within Company owned distribution
    centers, the majority of the automotive parts stores in which
    the Company has an ownership interest were operated in leased
    facilities. In addition, NAPA Canada/UAP operates
    12 distribution centers and approximately 208 automotive
    parts and Traction stores in Canada, and Auto Todo operates nine
    distribution centers and eight stores and tire centers in
    Mexico. These operations are operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group also operates four
    Balkamp distribution centers, three Rayloc rebuilding and
    distribution facilities and two transfer and shipping
    facilities. Finally, Altrom Canada operates 15 import parts
    distribution centers, Altrom America operates two import parts
    distribution centers and the Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates
    one TW distribution center, which serves 24 Traction stores of
    which 16 are company owned and located in the US. These
    operations are operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Industrial Parts Group, operating through
    Motion and Motion Canada, operates 7 distribution centers, 36
    service centers and 458 branches. Approximately 90% of these
    branches are operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Office Products Group operates 38 facilities
    in the United States and five facilities in Canada distributed
    among the Group’s five geographic divisions. Approximately
    75% of these facilities are operated in leased buildings.



The Company’s Electrical/Electronic Materials Group
    operates in 30 locations in the United States, one location in
    Puerto Rico, one location in the Dominican Republic, three
    locations in Mexico and one location in Canada. All of this
    Group’s 36 facilities are operated in leased buildings
    except one facility, which is owned.

We believe that our facilities on the whole are in good
    condition, are adequately insured, are fully utilized and are
    suitable and adequate for the conduct of our current operations.

For additional information regarding rental expense on leased
    properties, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

ITEM 3

.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental
    proceedings, many involving routine litigation incidental to the
    businesses, including approximately 1,700 product liability
    lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of automotive
    parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal
    injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts
    distributed by the Company. While litigation of any type
    contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that
    its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably
    anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary
    course of the Company’s business and that resolution of
    these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, results of operations or financial
    condition.

In constructing the peer group composite index (“Peer
    Index”) for use in the stock performance graph above, the
    Company used the shareholder returns of various publicly held
    companies (weighted in accordance with each company’s stock
    market capitalization at December 31, 2004 and including
    reinvestment of dividends) that compete with the Company in
    three industry segments: automotive parts, industrial parts and
    office products (each group of companies included in the Peer
    Index as competing with the Company in a separate industry
    segment is hereinafter referred to as a “Peer Group”).
    Included in the automotive parts Peer Group are those companies
    making up the Dow Jones Auto Parts and Equipment Index (the
    Company is a member of such industry group, and its individual
    shareholder return was included when calculating the Peer Index
    results set forth in the performance graph). Included in the
    industrial parts Peer Group are Applied Industrial Technologies,
    Inc. and Kaman Corporation and included in the office products
    Peer Group is United Stationers Inc. The Peer Index does not
    break out a separate electrical/electronic peer group due to the
    fact that there is currently no true market comparative to EIS.
    The electrical/electronic component of sales is redistributed to
    the Company’s other segments on a pro rata basis to
    calculate the final Peer Index.



In determining the Peer Index, each Peer Group was weighted to
    reflect the Company’s annual net sales in each industry
    segment. Each industry segment of the Company comprised the
    following percentages of the Company’s net sales for the
    fiscal years shown:

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

.

OVERVIEW

Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the
    distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial
    replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic
    materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating
    back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In
    2009, business was conducted throughout the United States,
    Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico from approximately 2,000
    locations.

We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.1 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 9% compared to
    $11.0 billion in 2008. Consolidated net income for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 was $400 million, down 16%
    from $475 million in 2008. The effects of the economic
    slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of
    2008, adversely impacted the results in all four of our business
    segments throughout 2009. Our businesses were impacted by the
    effects of reduced consumer spending, lower levels of industrial
    production and higher unemployment, which we discuss further
    below.

Our 2009 revenue decrease of 9% follows a 2% and 4% increase in
    revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 16% decrease in net
    income follows a 6% decrease in 2008 and a 7% increase in 2007.
    In each of the three years preceding 2007, the Company had
    experienced double-digit earnings growth. Throughout these
    periods, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in
    each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings,
    including the introduction of new and expanded product lines,
    geographic expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new
    markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of
    gross margin and cost savings initiatives. The prevailing
    economic conditions of the last two years have offset these
    initiatives, as reflected in our earnings for 2008 and 2009.

The following discussion addresses the major categories on the
    December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company’s cash balance of $337 million was up
    $269 million from $68 million at December 31,
    2008.



This improvement is due mainly to the decrease in inventory and
    increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008. In
    addition, we were less active in our share repurchase program
    during 2009 when compared to 2008. Accounts receivable decreased
    by approximately 3%, inventory was down by approximately 4% and
    accounts payable increased $85 million or 8% from the prior
    year, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain
    suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card
    program. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 was
    unchanged from $500 million at December 31, 2008.

Net
    Sales

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009
    totaled $10.1 billion, a 9% decrease from 2008. Each of our
    four businesses experienced sales decreases, with the Industrial
    and Electrical business segments showing the most significant
    declines, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was
    severely impacted by the weak economic conditions of the last
    15 months. Fortunately, the general weakness in demand
    resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production
    and higher unemployment seemed to stabilize over the last half
    of the year. Among the four quarters in 2009, the fourth quarter
    was the strongest period for sales in each business segment.
    Cumulatively, prices in 2009 were down approximately 3% in the
    Automotive segment, approximately flat in the Industrial segment
    and up approximately 4% in the Office segment and 2% in the
    Electrical segment.

Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2008
    totaled $11.0 billion, a 2% increase from 2007. In 2008,
    the Industrial and Electrical business segments showed the
    strongest sales growth among our operations, while the
    Automotive and Office segments continued to experience sluggish
    growth. For the year, Automotive reported a slight sales
    increase, while Office reported a decrease in revenues. For
    2008, prices were up approximately 6% in the Automotive segment,
    8% in the Industrial and Electrical segments and 4% in the
    Office segment. These price increases reflect the highest
    inflationary period for the Company in many years.

Automotive
    Group

Net sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) were
    $5.2 billion in 2009, a decrease of 2% from 2008. Sales
    were impacted by the soft economy, which has reduced the overall
    level of consumer spending and, specifically, the demand for
    automotive maintenance and supply items. The first half of the
    year proved to be the most challenging, with Automotive sales
    down 7% and 5% in the first and second quarters, respectively.
    Sales were down 1% in the third quarter followed by a 6%
    increase in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our
    Automotive sales for the year include acquisitions, which had an
    approximately 1% positive effect on sales, and the negative
    effect of currency, which negatively impacted sales by
    approximately 2%.

Automotive sales were $5.3 billion in 2008, essentially
    flat compared to 2007. Our rate of growth decreased during each
    quarter of the year, from 3% to 2% to 1% in the first, second
    and third quarters of 2008, respectively. This downward trend
    was partly due to the impact of the decrease in miles driven
    caused by high gas prices over most of the year. Demand weakened
    further in the fourth quarter of 2008, as evidenced by the
    decrease in consumer spending, resulting in a 6% sales decrease
    from the final quarter of 2007. This is consistent with
    historical patterns during a softening economy, when consumers
    defer or forego discretionary spending on automotive maintenance
    and supply items. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales
    for the year include acquisitions, which had a slightly positive
    effect on sales.



Industrial
    Group

Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group
    (“Industrial”), were $2.9 billion in 2009, a
    decrease of 18% compared to 2008. Through the first three
    quarters of the year, sales were especially weak for this group
    due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity, as
    evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial
    production and capacity utilization, and its negative impact on
    demand for industrial products. This weakness was widespread, as
    we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major
    customer categories. The industrial indices we follow seemed to
    show some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and
    we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we
    entered the fourth quarter. Industrial sales were down 11% in
    the fourth quarter, which marks a significant improvement from
    the declines of the first three quarters of the year. In 2009,
    sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions, which
    accounted for approximately 3% of Industrial’s sales growth
    for the year.

Net sales were $3.5 billion in 2008, an increase of 5%
    compared to 2007. Through the first three quarters of the year,
    sales held strong and were relatively consistent from quarter to
    quarter, increasing 6% in the first quarter and 7% in the second
    and third quarters. The fourth quarter proved to be more
    difficult for this business, due to the deteriorating economic
    environment, including worsening manufacturing production
    trends, and sales for the period were even with the fourth
    quarter of 2007. In 2008, sales were positively impacted by
    several acquisitions, which accounted for nearly 2% of
    Industrial’s sales for the year.

Office
    Group

Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group
    (“Office”), were $1.6 billion in 2009, down 5%
    compared to the prior year. 2009 represents the third
    consecutive year of decreased revenues for Office and reflects
    the negative impact of higher white collar and service
    unemployment on office products consumption, a trend that began
    in 2007. During the year, sales improved sequentially, with
    decreases of 7%, 6%, 5% and 4% in the first, second, third and
    fourth quarters, respectively. For the year, sales were
    positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008,
    which contributed nearly 3% to sales in Office. The increase in
    net sales due to acquisitions, as well as our sales initiatives,
    was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the
    office products industry.

Net sales for 2008 were $1.7 billion, down 2% compared to
    2007. This decline was indicative of the industry-wide slowdown
    in office products consumption. During the year, sales were down
    2% in the first quarter and even with the prior year periods in
    the second and third quarters. Demand in the fourth quarter
    worsened, consistent with the significant increase in
    unemployment for the period, and sales were down 5% from the
    2007 fourth quarter. For the year, sales were positively
    impacted by three acquisitions, which contributed nearly 2% to
    sales in Office.

Electrical
    Group

Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group
    (“Electrical”), decreased to $346 million in
    2009, down 26% from 2008. Electrical sales declined by 25% in
    the first quarter, 34% in the second quarter and 30% in the
    third quarter. For the fourth quarter, sales were down 12%.
    Manufacturing contraction, as measured by the Institute for
    Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, was evident
    through June and then began to stabilize and improve over the
    last half of the year. This factor, which we deem as positive
    for 2010, helps explain the quarterly sales trends at Electrical
    in 2009. Acquisitions had less than a 1% positive impact on
    Electrical sales in 2009.

Net sales increased by 7% to $466 million in 2008 compared
    to 2007. Electrical sales were strong through the first nine
    months of the year, increasing 7% in the first quarter, 11% in
    the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. The
    deteriorating economy had a significant impact on this business
    in the fourth quarter and sales decreased 4% from the same
    period in 2007. Acquisitions during the year had a positive 2%
    impact on Electrical sales in 2008 and, combined with
    Electrical’s sales initiatives, partially offset the
    weakening conditions in the marketplace in the last quarter of
    the year.

Cost
    of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold was $7.0 billion, $7.7 billion and
    $7.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 9%
    decrease in cost of goods sold from 2008 to 2009 is consistent
    with the sales decrease. Cost of goods sold



represented 70.1% of net sales in 2009 and 70.3% of net sales in
    2008 and 2007. The relatively constant rate over these three
    periods reflects how our ongoing gross margin initiatives to
    enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin
    products and minimize material acquisition costs were generally
    offset by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the
    markets we serve.

In 2009, our Office and Electrical business segments experienced
    vendor price increases. Industrial was flat and Automotive
    pricing was down for the year. In 2008 and 2007, all four of our
    business segments experienced vendor price increases. In any
    year where we experience price increases, we are able to work
    with our customers to pass most of these along to them.

Operating
    Expenses

Selling, administrative and other expenses
    (“SG&A”) decreased by $140 million to
    $2.2 billion in 2009, representing 22.1% of net sales and
    up from 21.4% of net sales in 2008. SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of net sales increased from the prior year due
    primarily to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9%
    sales decrease for the year. During 2009, management continued
    its implementation of extensive cost control initiatives to
    offset this loss of leverage. These measures emphasize
    continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our
    utilization of people and systems and, for the year, we
    eliminated approximately $70 million in operating costs.
    Examples of such savings include costs associated with
    personnel, freight, fleet and logistics, among others. The
    Company reduced its workforce by 7% in 2009 (before
    consideration of acquisitions) and this follows a 5% reduction
    in employees in 2008. Severance and other termination benefits
    associated with these employee reductions were insignificant.
    Our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of
    the appropriate cost structure in our businesses and the need
    for additional cost reductions, while maintaining our high
    standards for excellent customer service.

Depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was
    $90 million, up slightly from 2008. The provision for
    doubtful accounts was $28 million in 2009, up from a
    $24 million bad debt expense in 2008. Our bad debt expense
    reflects an increase in uncollectible accounts receivables in
    2009 and is likely directly correlated to the ongoing effects of
    the difficult economic climate, which has pressured certain of
    our customers. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for
    bad debts at December 31, 2009.

In 2008, SG&A was $2.4 billion, or 21.4% of net sales,
    which was an increase from 2007 when SG&A as a percentage
    of net sales was 21.0%. This increase was mainly due to the loss
    of leverage on the lower level of sales growth in 2008 relative
    to the prior year, which offset the benefits of our ongoing cost
    control initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in
    2008 was $89 million, relatively consistent with 2007. The
    provision for doubtful accounts was $24 million in 2008, up
    from a $14 million bad debt expense in 2007.

Total share-based compensation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $8.6 million,
    $13.0 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Refer
    to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information regarding share-based compensation.

Non-Operating
    Expenses and Income

Non-operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest
    expense was $28 million in 2009, a decrease from
    $32 million and $31 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The decrease is the result of an improved interest
    rate on certain long-term debt, effective November 2008.

In “Other”, interest income net of noncontrolling
    interests increased in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the
    elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009. In
    2008, interest income net of noncontrolling interests decreased
    from 2007 due to the effects of lower interest rates.

Income
    Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes was $644 million in 2009, a
    decrease of 16.0% from $768 million in 2008. As a
    percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 6.4% in
    2009, reflecting a decrease from 7.0% in 2008. In 2008, income
    before income taxes of $768 million was down 5.9% from
    $817 million in 2007 and as a percentage of net sales was
    7.0%, a decrease from 7.5% in 2007.



Automotive
    Group

Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net
    sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.4%
    in 2009 from 7.2% in 2008. The improvement in operating margin
    for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures
    implemented during 2008 and 2009. Automotive’s initiatives
    to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its
    operating margin in the years ahead.

Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.2% in 2008 from 7.8%
    in 2007. The decline in operating margin for 2008 is attributed
    to Automotive’s lower sales volume for the year, partially
    offset by the benefit of cost reduction measures.

Industrial
    Group

Industrial operating margins decreased to 5.6% in 2009 from 8.4%
    in 2008 and 2007. The decrease in operating margins in 2009 was
    primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial
    demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of
    2008. These conditions led to lower levels of sales volume in
    2009, which severely impacted our expense leverage, despite our
    cost reduction efforts. In addition, the decrease in inventory
    purchases in 2009, a direct result of lower sales, significantly
    reduced the level of volume incentives earned during the year.
    These factors more than offset our sales initiatives and cost
    reduction efforts. We will continue to focus on these areas,
    however, to show progress in the years ahead.

Office
    Group

Operating margins in Office were 7.7% in 2009, down from 8.3% in
    2008 and 8.9% in 2007. The prevailing weakness in the office
    products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the
    operating margins at Office in 2009. The decrease in revenues
    for these three periods has negatively impacted our expense
    leverage. Our sales strategy remains to capture additional
    market share, despite the industry slowdown.

Electrical
    Group

Operating margins in Electrical decreased to 7.3% in 2009 from
    7.9% in 2008. In 2008, the Electrical operating margins had
    increased to 7.9% from 7.0% in 2007 and marked the fifth
    consecutive year of operating margin improvement for Electrical.
    In 2009, the decrease in operating margins was primarily a
    function of weak market conditions. This factor outweighed the
    benefits of Electrical’s sales initiatives and expense
    savings. Ongoing efforts in these areas, as well as a more
    stable manufacturing sector, will serve to improve
    Electrical’s future operating margins.

Income
    Taxes

The effective income tax rate decreased to 38.0% in 2009 from
    38.1% in 2008. The decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to
    tax-free income in 2009 associated with a Company retirement
    plan. The 38.1% tax rate in 2008 had increased from 38.0% in
    2007. The increase from the prior year rate was mainly due to a
    non-deductible expense associated with a Company retirement plan.

Net
    Income

Net income was $400 million in 2009, a decrease of 16% from
    $475 million in 2008. On a per share diluted basis, net
    income was $2.50 in 2009 compared to $2.92 in 2008, down 14%.
    Net income in 2009 was 4.0% of net sales compared to 4.3% of net
    sales in 2008.

Net income was $475 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from
    $506 million in 2007. On a per share diluted basis, net
    income was $2.92 in 2008 compared to $2.98 in 2007, down 2%. Net
    income in 2008 was 4.3% of net sales compared to 4.7% of net
    sales in 2007.



FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

The following is a discussion of the Company’s financial
    condition at December 31, 2009. Our cash balance of
    $337 million was up $269 million from
    December 31, 2008, due primarily to the decrease in
    inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to
    2008. In addition, we were less active in our Company share
    repurchase program in 2009 when compared to 2008. The
    Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31,
    2009 decreased by approximately 3% from the prior year and
    inventory at December 31, 2009 was down by approximately 4%
    from December 31, 2008. Both of these decreases reflect our
    decline in sales for the year. Accounts payable increased
    $85 million or approximately 8% from December 31,
    2008, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain
    suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card
    program. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by
    $13 million or 8% from December 31, 2008 and relates
    primarily to the Company’s acquisitions during the year.
    The change in our December 31, 2009 balances for deferred
    taxes, down $51 million, as well as pension and other
    post-retirement benefits liabilities, down $202 million, is
    primarily due to a pension contribution of $53 million and
    a change in funded status of the Company’s pension and
    other post-retirement plans in 2009.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash
    flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private
    issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million
    of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, of
    which $250 million matures in 2011 and $250 million
    matures in 2013. The capital and credit markets continue to be
    volatile and if these conditions continue they are likely to
    impact our access to these markets. Currently, we believe that
    our available short-term and long-term sources of capital are
    sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, including
    working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest
    payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions,
    income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and
    contemplated acquisitions.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.9 to 1
    at December 31, 2009 compared to 3.0 to 1 at
    December 31, 2008. Our liquidity position remains solid.
    The Company had $500 million in total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, at
    December 31, 2009, the Company had available a
    $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit. No amounts
    were outstanding under the line of credit at December 31,
    2009 and 2008.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities:

The Company continues to generate cash and 2009 was an
    especially strong year, with net cash provided by operating
    activities totaling $845 million in 2009. This represents a
    59% increase from 2008, and primarily relates to the
    $368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital
    requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and
    accounts payable, net of the $76 million decrease in net
    income from 2008. The 17% decrease in net cash provided by
    operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the
    $116 million net increase in cash used for working capital
    requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and
    accounts payable, as well as the $31 million decrease in
    net income from 2007.



Net Cash
    Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash flow used in investing activities was $264 million
    in 2009 compared to $214 million in 2008, an increase of
    23%. Primarily, the increase in investing activities was due to
    the $73 million used in 2009 for the purchase of properties
    under a construction and lease agreement, net of the
    $36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from
    2008. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was
    relatively consistent with 2008. In 2008, the change in
    investing activities was primarily due to the $89 million
    increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2008
    and the $56 million decrease in cash proceeds from the sale
    of assets during the year, relative to 2007.

Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities:

The Company used $330 million of cash in financing
    activities in 2009, a 30% decrease from the $473 million
    used in financing activities in 2008. Cash used in financing
    activities in 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007. For the
    three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was
    primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase
    of the Company’s common stock. The Company paid dividends
    to shareholders of $254 million, $252 million and
    $243 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue
    in the foreseeable future. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company repurchased $26 million, $273 million and
    $241 million, respectively, of the Company’s common
    stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase
    program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will
    vary annually.

The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving
    line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions,
    which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus
    .30%. (0.53% at December 31, 2009). At December 31,
    2009 and 2008, no amounts were outstanding under the line of
    credit. Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve
    requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused
    letters of credit of approximately $50 million and
    $51 million outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured Senior
    Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing
    arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series B, 6.23%
    fixed, due 2011; and $250 million senior unsecured note,
    4.67% fixed, due 2013. Certain borrowings contain covenants
    related to a maximum

debt-to-capitalization

ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the
    Company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 5.45% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. Total interest expense, net of
    interest income, for all borrowings was $27.1 million,
    $29.8 million and $21.1 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Construction
    and Lease Agreement

The Company had an $85 million construction and lease
    agreement with an unaffiliated third party which expired in
    2009. Under the agreement, the third party constructed
    facilities and leased them to the Company. Upon expiration of
    the agreement, the Company purchased the properties from the
    lessor for $73 million, including closing costs, which was
    paid in July 2009. These properties have been included in
    property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.
    Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information regarding this arrangement.

Contractual
    and Other Obligations

In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the
    transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store
    properties and immediately leased the properties back over a
    lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an
    operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to
    approximately $56 million. The Company realized a net gain
    of approximately $20 million, which was deferred and is
    being amortized over the lease term.



The following table shows the Company’s approximate
    obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit
    facilities, to make future payments under contractual
    obligations as of December 31, 2009:

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows
    associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2009, the Company is unable to make reasonably
    reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the
    respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $41 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the
    contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income
    taxes.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and
    other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We
    are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase
    orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase
    orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than
    binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current
    distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short
    time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements
    for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum
    quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
    controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain
    other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling
    equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Company’s
    maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with
    these independents and affiliates is equal to the total
    borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. To date, the
    Company has had no significant losses in connection with
    guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’
    borrowings. The following table shows the Company’s

In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans
    that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from
    time to time. Contributions in 2009 were $56 million.
    Contributions required for 2010 and future years will depend on
    a number of unpredictable factors including the market
    performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in
    interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the
    plans’ obligations.

Share
    Repurchases

On August 21, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on
    November 17, 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of
    an additional 15 million shares. Such



repurchase plans were announced on August 21, 2006 and
    November 17, 2008, respectively. The authorization for
    these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been
    repurchased or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of
    the Board of Directors. In 2009, the Company repurchased
    approximately 722,000 shares and the Company had remaining
    authority to purchase approximately 17.8 million shares at
    December 31, 2009.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

General

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires
    management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales
    and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
    be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions.

We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies
    that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and
    judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it
    requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions
    about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is
    made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been
    used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably
    likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the
    consolidated financial statements. Management believes the
    following critical accounting policies reflect its most
    significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements. For further information
    on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the
    notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories —
    Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and
    estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto.
    Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as
    the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not
    highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return
    under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no
    reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be
    discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with
    obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were
    to occur.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts — Methodology

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable
    based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company
    estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of
    net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial
    estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware
    of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes
    in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company
    has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a
    general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in
    which the Company operates could result in higher than expected
    defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad
    debts. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of
    $28.5 million, $23.9 million, and $13.5 million,
    respectively.

Consideration
    Received from Vendors

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year
    with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase
    incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company
    earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified
    volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon
    fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising
    programs. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory
    purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on
    cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected
    inventory purchases through the end of the year and, in the case
    of advertising allowances, upon completion of the Company’s
    obligations related thereto. While management believes the
    Company will continue to receive such amounts in 2010



and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue
    to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in
    the future.

Impairment
    of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and
    equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential
    impairment indicators. The Company’s judgments regarding
    the existence of impairment indicators are based on market
    conditions and operational performance, among other factors.
    Future events could cause the Company to conclude that
    impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a
    particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment
    also requires the Company to estimate future operating results
    and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any
    resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and
    Canada establish investment policies and strategies and
    regularly monitor the performance of the Company’s pension
    plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by
    the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives
    and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable
    pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary
    standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan
    funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth
    of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets
    from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results
    that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed
    long term rate of return. The Company’s investment strategy
    with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in
    excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% S&P Index,
    5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE
    Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension
    plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the
    most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of
    return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions
    we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of
    compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and
    turnover rates.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plan, as well as
    an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s
    asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s
    expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2010
    pension expense or income is 8.00% for the plan. The asset study
    forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration
    of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market
    data and historical relationships.

The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension
    obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital
    market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched
    the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our
    pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad
    portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to
    select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching
    analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the
    U.S. plans of 6.54% at December 31, 2009.

Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans
    was $7.3 million, $46.9 million and $51.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The decreasing trend in pension cost over these
    periods was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent
    remeasurment which is discussed below, and the change in
    assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount
    rate and the rate of compensation increases. Refer to
    Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information regarding employee benefit plans.

In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non-cash
    curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization,
    which reduced the expected years of future service of employees
    covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.

In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the
    U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1,
    2010, future retirees will no longer receive employer-provided
    medical benefits and current pre-65 retirees will no longer
    receive employer-provided post-65 benefits (beyond an
    access-only arrangement).

We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each

    and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the
    annual basic and diluted earnings per share.

The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the
    amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial
    statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in
    its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of
    bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and volume
    incentives earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage
    of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon
    cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory
    adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the
    fourth quarter based on the annual October 31

book-to-physical

inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in
    deriving estimates for interim reporting typically results in
    adjustments upon accurate determination at year-end. The effect
    of these adjustments in 2009 and 2008 was not significant.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we
    file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or
    otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make
    available on our website, constitute forward-looking statements
    that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Senior officers may
    also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, the media
    and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements
    may relate, for example, to future operations, prospects,
    strategies, financial condition, economic performance (including
    growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our
    products and services. The Company cautions that its
    forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and
    while we believe that our expectations for the future are
    reasonable in view of currently available information, you are
    cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking
    statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from
    those indicated as a result of various important factors. Such
    factors include, but are not limited to, the ability to maintain
    favorable supplier arrangements and relationships, changes in
    general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market
    demand for the Company’s products and services, competitive
    product, service and pricing pressures, including internet
    related initiatives, changes in financial markets, including
    particularly the capital and credit markets, impairment of
    financial institutions, the effectiveness of the Company’s
    promotional, marketing and advertising programs, changes in laws
    and regulations,



including changes in accounting and taxation guidance, the
    uncertainties of litigation, as well as other risks and
    uncertainties discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for 2009 and from time to time in the Company’s subsequent
    filings with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are
    made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its
    forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are
    advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on
    related subjects in our subsequent

Forms 10-Q,

and other reports to the SEC.

ITEM 7A

.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
    RISK

.

Although the Company does not face material risks related to
    interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to
    changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign
    currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.

Foreign
    Currency

The Company has translation gains or losses that result from
    translation of the results of operations of an operating
    unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars
    for consolidated financial statement purposes. The
    Company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is
    the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our
    Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure
    particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser
    extent, the Mexican peso, negatively impacted our results for
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

During 2009 and 2008, it was estimated that a 10% shift in
    exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and
    the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by
    approximately $104 million and $118 million,
    respectively.

Management’s
    conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls
    and procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC

Rule 13a-15(e).

Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end
    of the period covered by this report, to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed in the
    Company’s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO
    and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    report on internal control over financial reporting

A report of management’s assessment of our internal control
    over financial reporting, as such term is defined in SEC

Genuine
    Parts Company

Management’s
    Responsibility for the Financial Statements

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements and related information included herein for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The opinion of
    Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, on those consolidated
    financial statements is included herein. The primary
    responsibility for the integrity of the financial information
    included in this annual report rests with management. Such
    information was prepared in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances based on
    our best estimates and judgments and giving due consideration to
    materiality.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company’s internal control system was designed to
    provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of the Company’s published consolidated
    financial statements. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

i. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and

iii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009.

In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.”
    Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the
    Company’s operating effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. This report
    appears on

page F-3.

Audit
    Committee Responsibility

The Audit Committee of Genuine Parts Company’s Board of
    Directors is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the
    Company’s financial reports and accounting practices to
    ascertain that they are within acceptable limits of sound
    practice in such matters. The membership of the Committee
    consists of non-employee Directors. At periodic meetings, the
    Audit Committee discusses audit and financial reporting matters
    and the internal audit function with representatives of
    financial management and with representatives from
    Ernst & Young LLP.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts Company

We have audited Genuine Parts Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Genuine Parts
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting section of the
    accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Genuine Parts Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Financial
    Statements

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Genuine Parts Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Genuine Parts Company at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations
    and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    noncontrolling interests with the adoption of the new guidance
    issued in FASB Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(codified in
    FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810,

Consolidation

) effective January 1, 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Genuine Parts Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2009

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Genuine Parts Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries
    (the Company) is a distributor of automotive replacement parts,
    industrial replacement parts, office products, and
    electrical/electronic materials. The Company serves a diverse
    customer base through approximately 2,000 locations in North
    America and, therefore, has limited exposure from credit losses
    to any particular customer, region, or industry segment. The
    Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
    customers’ financial condition and generally does not
    require collateral.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of the
    accounts of the Company. The net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests is not material to the Company’s
    consolidated net income. Significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may
    differ from those estimates and the differences could be
    material.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company records revenue when the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred, the Company’s price to the customer is fixed and
    determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery
    is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes
    the risks and rewards of ownership.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into
    U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates,
    respectively. The foreign currency translation adjustment is
    included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) income.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
    equivalents.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts
    receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the
    Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a
    percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience.
    This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company
    becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
    its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a
    result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable.
    While the Company has a large customer base that is
    geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of
    the industry segments in which the Company operates could result
    in higher than expected defaults, and, therefore, the need to
    revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recorded
    provisions for bad debts of approximately $28,463,000,
    $23,883,000, and $13,514,000, respectively. At December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the allowance for doubtful accounts was
    approximately $16,590,000 and $18,588,000, respectively.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Merchandise
    Inventories, Including Consideration Received From
    Vendors

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
    market. Cost is determined by the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for a majority of automotive parts,
    electrical/electronic materials, and industrial parts, and by
    the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method for office products and certain other
    inventories. If the FIFO method had been used for all
    inventories, cost would have been approximately $398,122,000 and
    $426,461,000 higher than reported at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. During 2009, reductions in inventory levels
    in industrial and electrical parts inventories resulted in
    liquidations of LIFO inventory layers. The effect of the LIFO
    liquidation was to reduce cost of goods sold by approximately
    $22,000,000.

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and
    estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically,
    these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of
    the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to
    obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor
    return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its
    inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future,
    its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving
    inventories would increase if such were to occur.

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year
    with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase
    incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company
    earns inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances
    upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other
    criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory
    purchase incentives and advertising allowances as part of its
    inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to
    date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the
    year, or, in the case of specific advertising allowances, upon
    completion of the Company’s obligations related thereto.
    While management believes the Company will continue to receive
    consideration from vendors in 2010 and beyond, there can be no
    assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable
    amounts of incentives and allowances in the future.

Prepaid
    Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of
    prepaid expenses and amounts due from vendors.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company reviews its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
    assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair
    value. The present value of future cash flows approach was used
    to determine any potential impairment. The Company determined
    that these assets were not impaired and, therefore, no
    impairments were recognized for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, or 2007. If an impairment occurs
    at a future date, it may have the effect of increasing the
    volatility of the Company’s earnings.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Buildings
    include certain leases capitalized at December 31, 2009 and
    2008. Depreciation and amortization is primarily determined on a
    straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life of
    each asset: buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years;
    machinery and equipment, 5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived
    Assets Other Than Goodwill

The Company assesses its long-lived assets other than goodwill
    for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze
    recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future
    cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these
    projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of
    assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. Impairment
    losses, if any, are measured based upon the difference between
    the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.

Other
    Long-Term Liabilities

The Company’s post-employment and other benefit liabilities
    consist primarily of actuarially determined obligations and
    deferred compensation plans. See Note 4 for further
    discussion of the Company’s obligations under capital
    leases and the sale-leaseback transaction. Other taxes payable
    consists primarily of unrecognized tax benefits.

Insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the
    workers’ compensation program. The Company carries various
    large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for
    the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. The
    Company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on
    an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis
    calculates development factors, which are applied to total
    reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who
    underwrite the program. While the Company believes that the
    assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate,
    significant differences in actual experience or significant
    changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’
    compensation costs.

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority of group health
    insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported
    is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the
    Company’s claims administrators. While the Company believes
    that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are
    appropriate, significant differences from historical trends may
    materially impact financial results. These reserves are included
    in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
    sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable
    and trade accounts payable approximate their respective fair
    values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of fixed rate
    debt was approximately $533,000,000 and $491,000,000,
    respectively, based primarily on quoted prices for similar
    instruments. The fair value of fixed rate debt was estimated by
    calculating the present value of anticipated cash flows. The
    discount rate used was an estimated borrowing rate for similar
    debt instruments with like maturities.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are classified as selling,
    administrative and other expenses in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income and totaled approximately
    $120,000,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    $140,000,000 in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled
    $44,500,000, $42,800,000, and $44,700,000 in the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Accounting
    for Legal Costs

The Company’s legal costs expected to be incurred in
    connection with loss contingencies are expensed as such costs
    are incurred.

Stock
    Compensation

The Company maintains various long-term incentive plans, which
    provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs),
    performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based
    awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an
    amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess,
    if any, of the fair market value of the Company’s common
    stock on the date of exercise over the base value of the grant.
    The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of
    common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs
    represent a contingent right to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock at a future date. The majority of
    awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods
    ranging from one to five years and are expensed accordingly on a
    straight-line basis. The Company issues new shares upon exercise
    or conversion of awards under these plans.

Net
    Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net
    income by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted net
    income per common share includes the

F-12


Genuine
    Parts Company and Subsidiaries

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and
    non-vested restricted stock awards options. Options to purchase
    approximately 5,400,000, 4,400,000 and 1,600,000 shares of
    common stock ranging from $37 — $49 per share were
    outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. These options were not included in the computation
    of diluted net income per common share because the options’
    exercise price was greater than the average market price of
    common stock.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year presentation.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued guidance that establishes new accounting and
    reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This
    guidance requires that noncontrolling minority interests be
    reported as equity instead of a liability on the balance sheet.
    Additionally, it requires disclosure of consolidated net income
    attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on
    the face of the income statement. The guidance is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2009 and
    reclassified noncontrolling interests from liabilities to equity
    for all periods presented. Refer to Note 9 for a
    description of the Company’s acquisition of a substantial
    portion of the noncontrolling interests during 2009. The net
    income attributable to noncontrolling interests is not material
    to the Company’s consolidated net income.

In December 2008, the FASB provided additional guidance on an
    employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plan on investment
    policies and strategies, major categories of plan assets, inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan
    assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2009, with earlier application
    permitted. Upon initial application, these provisions are not
    required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative
    purposes. The Company adopted the guidance for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Refer to Note 7 for the additional
    disclosures required by this guidance.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the
    elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose
    entity. It also replaces the quantitative-based risks and
    rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a
    controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity
    with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the
    power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the guidance
    requires an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the
    primary beneficiary of the entity. The guidance is effective for
    the Company beginning on January 1, 2010. The Company does
    not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Credit
    Facilities

There were no amounts subject to variable rates at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. The weighted average interest
    rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings was
    approximately 5.45% at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company maintains a $350,000,000 unsecured revolving line of
    credit with a consortium of financial institutions that matures
    in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.30% (0.53%
    at December 31, 2009). The Company also has the option
    under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional
    $200,000,000. No amounts were outstanding under this line of
    credit at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Certain borrowings
    contain covenants related to a maximum

debt-to-capitalization

ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants. Due to the workers compensation and insurance
    reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had
    unused letters of credit of $50,403,000 and $50,553,000
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Leased
    Properties

In June 2003, the Company completed an amended and restated
    master agreement to the $85,000,000 construction and lease
    agreement (the Agreement). The lessor in the Agreement was an
    independent third-party limited liability company, which had as
    its sole member a publicly traded corporation. Properties
    acquired by the lessor were constructed

and/or

then
    leased to the Company under operating lease agreements. On
    June 26, 2009, the Agreement expired. In accordance with
    the Agreement, the Company purchased the properties from the
    lessor for $72,814,000, including closing costs. The properties
    have been included in property, plant, and equipment in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Rent expense related to the Agreement is recorded under selling,
    administrative, and other expenses in our consolidated
    statements of income and was $489,000, $2,586,000, and
    $4,877,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the
    transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store
    properties and immediately leased the properties back over a
    lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an
    operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to
    approximately $56,000,000. The Company realized a net gain of
    approximately $20,000,000, which was deferred and is being
    amortized over the lease term. The unamortized portion of the
    deferred gain is included in other long-term liabilities in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, buildings include
    $11,550,000 with accumulated depreciation of $7,823,000 and
    $6,831,000, respectively, for capital leases of distribution
    centers and stores. Depreciation expense for capital leases was
    approximately $1,828,000, $2,267,000, and $2,509,000 in 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively.

Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under the
    capital and noncancelable operating leases with initial or

Stock
    Options and Restricted Stock Awards

The Company maintains various long-term incentive plans, which
    provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs),
    performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based
    awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an
    amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess,
    if any, of the fair market value of the Company’s common
    stock on the date of exercise over the base value of the grant.
    The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of
    common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs
    represent a contingent right to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock at a future date. The majority of
    awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods
    ranging from one to five years and are expensed accordingly on a
    straight-line basis. The Company issues new shares upon exercise
    or conversion of awards under these plans.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, total compensation
    cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was
    approximately $4,500,000. The weighted-average period over which
    this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is
    approximately one year. The aggregate intrinsic value for
    options and RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    was approximately $17,500,000 and $24,900,000, respectively. The
    aggregate intrinsic value for options and RSUs vested totaled
    approximately $12,200,000 and $13,300,000 at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the
    weighted-average contractual life for outstanding and
    exercisable options and RSUs was five years. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, $8,578,000, $12,977,000,
    and $14,300,000 of share-based compensation cost was recorded,
    respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the
    consolidated statements of income for share-based compensation
    arrangements was approximately $3,400,000, $5,200,000, and
    $5,700,000 for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. There have
    been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 the fair
    value for options and SARs granted was estimated using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions, respectively: risk-free interest
    rate of 3.5% and 4.6%; dividend yield of 3.0% and 3.1%; annual
    historical volatility factor of the expected market price of the
    Company’s common stock of 17% and 21%; an average expected
    life and estimated turnover based on the historical pattern of
    existing grants of six years and 4.0% to 5.1%, respectively. The
    fair value of RSUs is based on the price of the Company’s
    stock on the date of grant. The Company had no grant activity
    for the year ended December 31, 2009. The total fair value
    of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007, was $13,200,000, $14,900,000, and $10,500,000,
    respectively.

    outstanding is approximately six years.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options and SARs
    granted during the years 2008 and 2007 was $5.78 and $9.64,
    respectively. The Company had no grant activity for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The aggregate intrinsic value of
    options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007 was $4,700,000, $5,000,000, and $15,600,000.

In 2008, the Company granted approximately 1,385,000 SARs and
    116,000 RSUs. In 2007, the Company granted approximately

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used
    for income tax purposes. Undistributed earnings of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
    indefinitely reinvested. As such, no U.S. federal and state
    income taxes have been provided thereon, and it is not
    practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized
    deferred income tax liability. Significant components of the
    Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign
    jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to federal, state and local tax examinations by tax
    authorities for years before 2006 or subject to

non-United

States income tax examinations for years ended prior to 2002.
    The Company is currently under audit in the United States and
    Canada. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and
    the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits
    may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not possible to
    estimate the effect, if any, of the amount of such change during
    the next twelve months to previously recorded uncertain tax
    positions in connection with the audits. However, the Company
    does not anticipate total unrecognized tax benefits will
    significantly change during the year due to the settlement of
    audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The amount of gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $41,013,000
    and $36,429,000, respectively, of which approximately
    $15,129,000 and $14,417,000, respectively, if recognized, would
    affect the effective tax rate. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company paid
    interest and penalties of approximately $363,000, $815,000, and
    $600,000, respectively. The Company had approximately $7,691,000
    and $5,004,000 of accrued interest and penalties at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    recognizes potential interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s defined benefit pension plans cover most of
    its employees in the U.S. and Canada. The plan covering
    U.S. employees is noncontributory and benefits are based on
    the employees’ compensation during the highest five of
    their last ten years of credited service. The Canadian plan is
    contributory and benefits are based on career average
    compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute
    an amount equal to the minimum required contribution under
    ERISA. The Company may increase its contribution above the
    minimum if appropriate to its tax and cash position and the
    plans’ funded position.

In 2008, the U.S. defined benefit plan was amended to
    prohibit employees hired on or after March 1, 2008 from
    participating in the plan. The plan was also amended to freeze
    credited service for participants who do not meet certain age
    and length of service requirements as of December 31, 2008.
    However, the plan continues to reflect future pay increases for
    all participants.

In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4,298,000 non-cash
    curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization,
    which reduced the expected years of future service of employees
    covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.
    Curtailment accounting is required if an event eliminates, for a
    significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits
    for some or all of their future services.

The Company also sponsors unfunded supplemental retirement plans
    covering employees in the U.S. and Canada and other
    postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. The Company uses a
    measurement date of December 31st for its pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans.

In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the
    U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1,
    2010, future retirees will no longer receive employer-provided
    medical benefits and current pre-65 retirees will no longer
    receive employer-provided post-65 medical benefits (beyond an
    access-only arrangement).

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and
    Canada establish investment policies and strategies and
    regularly monitor the performance of the funds. The pension plan
    strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to
    achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in
    accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the
    U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The
    long-term primary objectives for the pension plans are to
    provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital,
    without undue exposure to risk,

F-20


Genuine
    Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power, and provide
    investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’
    actuarially assumed long term rates of return. The
    Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan
    assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive
    portfolio benchmark (50% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap
    Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, and 30%
    BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

The fair values of the plan assets as of December 31, 2009,
    by asset category, are shown in the table below. Various inputs
    are considered when determining the value of the Company’s
    pension plan assets. The inputs or methodologies used for
    valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk
    associated with investing in these securities. Level 1
    represents observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted
    prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
    Level 2 represents other significant observable inputs
    (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
    credit risk, etc.) Level 3 represents significant
    unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own
    assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

The valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that
    may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
    future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its
    valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
    market participants, the use of different methodologies or
    assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
    instruments could result in a different fair value measurement
    at the reporting date. Equity securities are valued at the
    closing price reported on the active market on which the
    individual securities are traded on the last day of the calendar
    plan year. Debt securities including corporate bonds,
    U.S. Government securities, and asset-backed securities are
    valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid

and/or

ask
    sides of the market for an investment as of the last day of the
    calendar plan year. Real estate value is based on the last
    appraised or interim valuation. The timing of the individual
    property appraisals is spread throughout the four quarters of
    the year.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as
    an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s
    asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s
    expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2010
    pension cost or income is 8.00% for the plans. The asset study
    forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration
    of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market

For the pension benefits, the following table reflects the total

    contributions reflect amounts expected to be contributed to
    funded plans. For other postretirement benefits, the following

    cost. The expected benefit payments show the Company’s cost
    without regard to income from federal subsidy payments received

The Company has two defined contribution plans that cover
    substantially all of its domestic employees. The Company’s
    matching contributions are determined based on the
    employee’s participation in the U.S. pension plan.
    Pension plan participants who continue earning credited service
    after 2008 receive a matching contribution of 20% of the first
    6% of the employee’s salary. Other employees receive a
    matching contribution of 100% of the first 5% of the
    employee’s salary. Total plan expense for both plans was
    approximately $31,783,000 in 2009, $7,252,000 in 2008, and
    $7,245,000 in 2007.

Guarantees

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
    controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain
    other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling
    equity ownership interest (affiliates). Presently, the
    independents are generally consolidated by unaffiliated
    enterprises that have a controlling financial interest through
    ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. The
    Company has no voting interest or other equity conversion rights
    in any of the independents. The Company does not control the
    independents or the affiliates, but receives a fee for the
    guarantee. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary
    beneficiary with respect to any of the independents and that the
    affiliates are not variable interest entities. The
    Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
    involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to
    the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee.
    While such borrowings of the independents and affiliates are
    outstanding, the Company is required to maintain compliance with
    certain covenants, including a maximum debt to capitalization
    ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

At December 31, 2009, the total borrowings of the
    independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the Company
    were approximately $200,857,000. These loans generally mature
    over periods from one to six years. In the event that the
    Company is required to make payments in connection with
    guaranteed obligations of the independents or the affiliates,
    the Company would obtain and liquidate certain collateral (e.g.,
    accounts receivable and inventory) to recover all or a portion
    of the amounts paid under the guarantee. When it is deemed
    probable that the Company will incur a loss in connection with a
    guarantee, a liability is recorded equal to this estimated loss.
    To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection
    with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’
    borrowings.

The Company has accrued for guarantees related to the
    independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. These liabilities are not
    material to the financial position of the Company and are
    included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisitions

During 2009, the Company acquired eight companies in the
    Industrial and Automotive Groups for approximately $71,038,000.
    The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired
    and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of
    their respective acquisition dates. The results of operations
    for the acquired companies were included in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of income beginning on their respective
    acquisition dates. The Company recorded approximately
    $12,199,000 of goodwill and other intangible assets associated
    with the acquisitions.

On June 1, 2009, the Company acquired the remaining
    noncontrolling interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Balkamp,
    Inc., for approximately $63,165,000. The acquisition was
    accounted for as an equity transaction and the associated
    noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary’s equity was
    eliminated as part of the transaction.

During 2008, the Company acquired eleven companies in the
    Automotive, Industrial, Office Supply and Electrical/Electronic
    Groups for approximately $133,604,000. The Company allocated the
    purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities
    assumed based on their fair values as of their respective
    acquisition dates. The results of operations for the acquired
    companies were included in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of income beginning on their respective acquisition
    dates. The Company recorded approximately $84,442,000 of
    goodwill and other intangible assets associated with these
    acquisitions.

    beginning January 1, 2010 through February 26, 2010,
    the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. The
    Company concluded that there were no events or transactions
    occurring during this period that required recognition or

Segment
    Data

The Company’s reportable segments consist of automotive,
    industrial, office products, and electrical/electronic
    materials. Within the reportable segments, certain of the
    Company’s operating segments are aggregated since they have
    similar economic characteristics, products and services, type
    and class of customers, and distribution methods.

The Company’s automotive segment distributes replacement
    parts (other than body parts) for substantially all makes and
    models of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles.

The Company’s industrial segment distributes a wide variety
    of industrial bearings, mechanical and fluid power transmission
    equipment, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material
    handling components, and related parts and supplies.

    Statements — (Continued)

The Company’s office products segment distributes a wide
    variety of office products, computer supplies, office furniture,
    and business electronics.

The Company’s electrical/electronic materials segment
    distributes a wide variety of electrical/electronic materials,
    including insulating and conductive materials for use in
    electronic and electrical apparatus.

Inter-segment sales are not significant. Operating profit for
    each industry segment is calculated as net sales less operating
    expenses excluding general corporate expenses, interest expense,
    equity in income from investees, amortization, and
    noncontrolling interests. Approximately $38,900,000,
    $49,900,000, and $46,900,000 of income before income taxes was
    generated in jurisdictions outside the United States for the
    years ending December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. Net sales and net long-lived assets by country
    relate directly to the Company’s operations in the
    respective country. Corporate assets are principally cash and
    cash equivalents and headquarters’ facilities and equipment.

For management purposes, net sales by segment exclude the effect
    of certain discounts, incentives, and freight billed to
    customers. The line item “other” represents the net
    effect of the discounts, incentives, and freight billed to
    customers, which are reported as a component of net sales in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of income.
