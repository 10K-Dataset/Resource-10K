Canada and in Mexico from approximately 1,800 locations. As used in this
report, the “Company” refers to Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries,
except as otherwise indicated by the context; and the terms “automotive parts”
and “industrial parts” refer to replacement parts in each respective category.

Segment Data

. For information regarding segment data, refer to the Company’s
Audited Financial Statements as set forth on Pages 12 and 33 of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for 2003 attached hereto as Exhibit 13.

Competition - General

. The distribution business, which includes all segments
of the Company’s business, is highly competitive with the principal methods of
competition being product quality, sufficiency of inventory, price and the
ability to give the customer prompt and dependable service. The Company
anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the
foreseeable future.

Employees

. As of December 31, 2003, the Company employed approximately 30,800
persons.

AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

.

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is
the largest member of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a
voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution
of automotive parts. In addition to over 300,000 available part numbers, the
Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket.

During 2003, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive
parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or
“NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned in the United States by the Company; automotive
parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in Canada owned and operated
by UAP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores in the
United States operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a
minority or majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by
corporations in which UAP owned a 50% interest; distribution centers owned by
Balkamp, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company; rebuilding plants
owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; distribution centers
of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive supplies owned and operated by
Johnson Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary; and automotive parts
distribution centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated
by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a company in which a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owns a controlling interest.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a
subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair
information company with over 35,000 North American subscribers linked to its
services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND”,
is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute
replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle
makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles,
trucks, SUV’s, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include
accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a
wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops,
service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing
companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns
and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.
Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from more than
75 different suppliers, approximately 53% of 2003 automotive parts inventories
were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company

-2-


has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the
Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2003, the Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive
parts distribution centers located in 39 states and approximately 900 domestic
company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states. At December 31,
2003, Genuine Parts Company owned either a minority or majority interest in 4
corporations, which operated approximately 24 auto parts stores in 4 states.

UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution, marketing,
and rebuilding of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks.
UAP employs approximately 4,200 people. UAP operates a network of 14
distribution centers supplying approximately 592 UAP/NAPA auto parts and 62
TRACTION wholesalers, which supply parts to small fleet owners-operators and
are a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries. These
include approximately 204 company owned stores, 21 joint venture or progressive
owners in which UAP owns a 50% interest, and approximately 429 independently
owned stores. UAP supplies bannered installers and independent installers in
all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service station and repair
shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is licensed to and
uses the NAPA® name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 9 distribution centers and 15 auto
parts stores. Auto Todo is licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Mexico.

The Company’s distribution centers serve approximately 5,000 independently
owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served. NAPA
AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the
automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts
stores account for approximately 25% of the Company’s total sales with no
automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or
common ownership accounting for more than 0.5% of the total sales of the
Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 300,000 different parts and
related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification
and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and
frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same
day as received. The majority of sales are on terms that require payment
within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of
the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under
the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. A majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, Balkamp, Inc.
(“Balkamp”), distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory
items for passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment.
In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment,
lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items
used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp packages many of
the approximately 27,000 part numbers, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of
products that are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are
categorized in 160 different product groups purchased from more than 400
domestic suppliers and 130 foreign manufacturers. BALKAMP®, a federally
registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing promotions of the
Balkamp organization. Balkamp has four distribution centers located in
Indianapolis and Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi, and West Jordan,
Utah.

Johnson Industries, Inc. (“Johnson”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, is an independent distributor of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other
automotive supplies. Johnson, founded in 1924, sells primarily to large fleets
and new car dealers from a network of distribution centers throughout the U.S.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates five plants where
certain small automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are distributed to
the members of NAPA under the NAPA brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to
the Company by NAPA.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2003, sales from the Automotive
Parts Group approximated 53% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 52% in
2002 and 51% in 2001.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and
the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such
services include fast and frequent delivery, obsolescence protection, parts
cataloging (including the use of computerized NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and
stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent jobbers to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The
Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids,
marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis,
accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, marketing
conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.
Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive
Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company
for the NAPA AUTO PARTS store.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an
inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and
auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on
automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological
advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control
procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management
services, which the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store
customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant, and the Company attributes this to the successful
operation of its classification system, which involves product return
privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for
vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those which they build
themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts
retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets
of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national
retail chains, and with other parts distributors and jobbers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of
automotive replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2003 operated 64
distribution centers located throughout the United States, 58 of which were
owned and operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and
programs that may be used by its members. It is not involved in the chain of
distribution.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired the assets of NAPA
Hawaii, a NAPA member company owned by Schuman Carriage Company, LTD. This
acquisition includes a distribution center that services 37 stores throughout
the Hawaiian Islands as of December 31, 2003.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes
are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA”
lines. The members are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts
so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from other supply
sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered
trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program,
which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to
promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA
itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit,
Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under
the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among
such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts
customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto
parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts and
related supplies throughout the United States and Canada. This Group
distributes industrial bearings and power transmission equipment replacement
parts, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material handling
components, agricultural and irrigation equipment and related supplies. The
Group is continuing to enhance their internet-based procurement solutions with
MotionMRO.com.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States through
Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.
Motion is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In Canada, industrial
parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”), an
operating group in the Company’s North American structure. Motion Canada’s
service area includes nine provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba,
New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.
The Company has return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has
protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

During 2003, the Company sold the Group’s interest in a partnership with
Refacciones Industriales de Mexico (“RIMSA”), which distributed industrial
parts in Mexico.

As of December 31, 2003, the Group served more than 150,000 customers in
all types of industries located throughout the United States and Canada.

Distribution System

. In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operates 422
branches, nine distribution centers, and 32 service centers. The distribution
centers stock and distribute more than 200,000 different items purchased from
more than 250 different suppliers. Approximately 33% of 2003 total industrial
purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the
Group’s branches located in 48 states and nine provinces in Canada. Each branch
has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory
representative of the lines of products used by customers in the respective
market area served.

Motion Canada operates two distribution centers for the 47 Canadian
locations serving industrial and agricultural markets. Motion Canada also
distributes irrigation systems and related supplies.

Products

. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to
its customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants,
machinery and equipment. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings,
pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers and electric
motors. The nature of this Group’s business demands the maintenance of large
inventories and the ability to provide prompt and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the
customer. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries
are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all
sales are on open account.

Related Information

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with
most of the Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it
has been the experience of the Group that the custom of the trade is to treat
such agreements as continuing until breached by one party, or until terminated
by mutual consent.

Integrated Supply

. Motion’s integrated supply process reduces the costs
associated with MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operation) inventory management,
but also enables the manufacturing customer to focus on its core competency,
free working capital associated with inventories, improve service levels to
end-users, and allow management to focus on more strategic concerns. Motion’s
integrated supply process analyzes a customer’s current operation to develop
integration goals and then provides solutions based on industry’s accepted best
practices.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2003, sales from the Company’s
Industrial Parts Group approximated 27% of the Company’s net sales as compared
to 27% in 2002 and 2001.

-5-


Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors
specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and
others who have developed or joined integrated supply programs. To a lesser
extent, the Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the
customer.

ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC MATERIALS GROUP.

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group was formed on July 1, 1998
through the acquisition of EIS, Inc. (“EIS”). This Group distributes materials
to more than 20,000 electrical and electronic manufacturers in North America.
With branches in 33 locations nationwide and in Mexico, this Group distributes
over 100,000 items, from insulating and conductive materials to assembly tools
and test equipment. This Group also has three manufacturing facilities that
provide custom fabricated parts.

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group is an important single source to

through EIS’s operating divisions, Electronic Assembly (previously known as
Com-Kyl) and Circuit Supply. Both electrical and electronic products are
distributed from warehouse locations in major user markets throughout the U.S.
The Company has return privileges with some of its suppliers, which has
protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to Our Company

We Depend on Our Relationships with Our Vendors.

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, office
products and electrical/electronic materials, our business is dependent on
developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors.
We depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices.
Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example,
financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to
increase the cost of the products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation
could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products
and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. Also,
consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product
suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors. A disruption of
our vendor relationships or a

-8-


disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

Our Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impacted by Certain Laws.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations relating to the operation of our business, such as laws and
regulations relating to environmental and employment matters. If we fail to
comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to
governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. There can be no assurance that
compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse
effect on us in the future.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.

The industries in which we do business are highly competitive. The sale of
automotive and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials is
highly competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product
availability, customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences,
store location and price. Increased price competition among distributors of
automotive and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials could
cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly
competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We compete
primarily with national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned
automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply
manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and
wholesale clubs that sell automotive products, and regional and local full
service automotive repair shops. If we are unable to continue to develop
successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more effective
strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

Our Business May Be Materially Affected If Demand For Our Products Slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute.
Demand for these products depends on many factors. With respect to our
automotive group, the primary factors are: the number of miles vehicles are
driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance
and repair; the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new
vehicles; the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and
older, as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle
manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer
vehicles; restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information
imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation;
and the economy generally.

Our Business May Be Impacted by General Economic Conditions and Local, National
and Global Events.

Our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic
conditions, conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot
control, including: economic conditions, job growth and unemployment
conditions, industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures, reduction
in manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to
consolidation and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to

-9-


foreign countries, weather, terrorist acts, pricing pressures of our
competitors and customers, shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation
systems, labor strikes, work stoppages, or other interruptions to or
difficulties in the employment of labor in the major markets where we operate,
changes in interest rates, inflation or currency exchange rates, changes in
accounting policies and practices.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The Company’s headquarters and Automotive Parts Group headquarters are
located in two adjacent office buildings owned by the Company in Atlanta,
Georgia.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group currently operates 58 NAPA
Distribution Centers in the United States distributed among four geographic
divisions. Approximately 90% of the distribution center properties are owned
by the Company. At December 31, 2003, the Company operated approximately 900
NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states, and the Company owned either a
minority or majority interest in approximately 24 additional auto parts stores
located in 4 states. Other than NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located within Company
owned distribution centers, most of the automotive parts stores in which the
Company has an ownership interest were operated in leased facilities. In
addition, UAP operated 14 distribution centers and approximately 225 automotive
parts and TRACTION stores in Canada, and Auto Todo operates 9 distribution
centers and 15 stores in Mexico. The Company’s Automotive Parts Group also
operates four Balkamp distribution centers, five Rayloc rebuilding plants, one
transfer and shipping facility, and twelve Johnson Industries distribution
centers.

Canada, operates 9 distribution centers, 32 service centers and 422 branches.
Approximately 90% of these branches are operated in leased facilities.

divisions. Approximately 75% of these facilities are operated in leased

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental proceedings, many
involving routine litigation incidental to the businesses, including several
hundred product liability lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of
automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal injury
allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by the
Company. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, the
Company believes that its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and
reasonably anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary course
of the Company’s business, and that resolution of these claims will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or consolidated business
and financial condition.
