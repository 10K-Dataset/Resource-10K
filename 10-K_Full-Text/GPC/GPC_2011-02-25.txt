AUTOMOTIVE
    PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
    distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items.
    The Company is the largest member, with approximately 95%
    ownership, of the National Automotive Parts Association
    (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925
    to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In
    addition to over 420,000 available part numbers, the Company, in
    conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging,
    marketing, training and other programs in the automotive
    aftermarket.

During 2010, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included
    NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts
    stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores”) owned and operated in the United States by
    the Company; NAPA and Traction automotive parts distribution
    centers and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada
    owned and operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc.
    (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a

wholly-owned

subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores and distribution
    centers in the United States operated by corporations in which
    the Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling
    interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations
    in which UAP owns a 50% interest; import automotive parts
    distribution centers in the United States owned by the Company
    and operated by its Altrom America division; import automotive
    parts distribution centers in Canada owned and operated by
    Altrom Canada Corporation (“Altrom Canada”), a

wholly-owned

subsidiary of the Company; distribution centers in the United
    States owned by Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; rebuilding and
    distribution plants in the United States owned by the
    Company and operated by its Rayloc division; and automotive
    parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores in
    Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company.



The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information
    (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC
    is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information
    company with over 40,000 North American subscribers linked to
    its services and information databases. MRIC’s core
    product, “Mitchell

ON-DEMAND,”

is a premier electronic repair information source in the
    automotive aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers
    distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for
    substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in
    the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs,
    buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
    addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small
    engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The
    Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such
    vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety
    of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair
    shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck
    dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass
    merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who
    perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although
    the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from
    approximately 100 different suppliers, approximately 52% of 2010
    automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major
    suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company
    from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

.  In 2010, the
    Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution
    centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,000
    domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in
    42 states. At December 31, 2010, the Company owned
    either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in two
    corporations, which operated approximately 19 auto parts stores
    in three states, and a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation
    operating three distribution centers in two states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the
    distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories
    for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs
    approximately 3,500 people and operates a network of 12
    distribution centers supplying approximately 590 NAPA stores and
    98 Traction wholesalers. Traction is a supplier of parts to
    small and large fleet owners and operators and, together with
    NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining and
    forestry industries. The NAPA stores and Traction in Canada
    include approximately 189 company owned stores, 30 joint
    venture or progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a
    50% interest and approximately 469 independently owned stores.
    NAPA and Traction operations supply bannered installers and
    independent installers in all provinces of Canada, as well as
    networks of service station and repair shops operating under the
    banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Canada.

In Canada, Altrom Canada Corp. operates 15 import automotive
    parts distribution centers. In the United States, Altrom America
    operates two import automotive parts distribution centers.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 10 distribution centers,
    four auto parts stores and four tire centers. Auto Todo is a
    licensee of the
    NAPA

®

name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve
    approximately 4,700 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores
    located throughout the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in
    turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive
    aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts
    stores account for approximately 66% of the Company’s total
    U.S. Automotive sales and 27% of the Company’s total
    sales, with no automotive parts store or group of automotive
    parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for
    more than 0.25% of the total sales of the Company.

Products

.  Distribution centers have
    access to over 420,000 different parts and related supply items.
    Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and
    accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide
    for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are
    filled and shipped the same day as received. The majority of
    sales are on terms that require payment within 30 days of
    the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the
    products it distributes. The majority of products are
    distributed under the
    NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important
    to the sales and marketing of these products. Traction sales
    also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a
    proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck
    market.



Related Operations

.  Balkamp, a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide
    variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger
    cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In
    addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing
    equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies,
    chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms
    and institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 45,000 products,
    which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that
    are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are
    categorized into over 250 different product groups purchased
    from approximately 600 domestic suppliers and 100 foreign
    manufacturers. In addition, Balkamp operates two Redistribution
    Centers that provide NAPA with over 1,900 SKUs of oils,
    chemicals and procurement items.
    BALKAMP

,

    a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and
    marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has
    three distribution centers located in Indianapolis and
    Plainfield, Indiana, and West Jordan, Utah.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, operates four
    facilities where certain small automotive parts are rebuilt or
    distributed to the members of NAPA under the
    NAPA

®

brand name.
    Rayloc

®

is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW
    Distribution, with one warehouse location in Atlanta, Georgia,
    which serves 23 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the United
    States, of which 15 are company-owned and eight are
    independently owned. This group distributes heavy vehicle parts
    through the NAPA system and direct to small fleet owners and
    operators.

Segment Data

.  In the year ended
    December 31, 2010, sales from the Automotive Parts Group
    were approximately 50% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 52% in 2009 and 48% in 2008. For additional segment
    information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

page F-1.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

.  The
    Company believes that the quality and the range of services
    provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a
    significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution
    system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
    obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of
    electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment
    through a continuing parts classification system which, as
    initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent
    retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on
    a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store
    customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on
    topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting
    procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as
    well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and
    advertising manuals and training programs. Point of
    sale/inventory management is available through
    TAMS

®

(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system
    designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS
    stores.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined
    an inventory classification system to determine optimum
    distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
    automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations,
    usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and
    other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
    analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s
    inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature
    of the inventory management services that the Company makes
    available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last
    10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been
    insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful
    operation of its classification system, which involves product
    return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

.  The automotive parts
    distribution business is highly competitive. The Company
    competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell
    replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as
    well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers,
    warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In
    addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of
    parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers,
    including national retail chains, and with other parts
    distributors and retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes
    primarily on product offering, service, brand recognition and
    price. Further information regarding competition in the industry
    is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We
    Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do
    Business.”

NAPA

.  The Company is a member of the
    National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary association
    formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive
    replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor



sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose
    members in 2010 operated 64 distribution centers located
    throughout the United States, 58 of which were owned and
    operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and
    programs that may be used by its members. It is not involved in
    the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and
    distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised
    and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not
    required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so
    designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from
    other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally
    registered trademark
    NAPA

®

as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and
    parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national
    advertising program, which is designed to increase public
    recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and
    NAPA itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District
    Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
    decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust
    laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
    manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of
    territories among several NAPA members, fixing of prices or
    terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements
    to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or
    determining the number and location of, or arrangements with,
    auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL
    PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group is operated as Motion Industries,
    Inc. (“Motion”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion distributes
    industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as
    bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission,
    industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components,
    industrial supplies and material handling products to MRO
    (maintenance, repair and operation) and OEM (original equipment
    manufacturer) customers throughout the United States, Canada and
    Mexico.

In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries
    (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”) and BC Bearing
    Engineers Limited. The Mexican market is served by Motion Mexico
    S de RL de CV (“Motion Mexico”). These organizations
    operate in the Company’s North American structure.

In March 2010, the Company acquired BC Bearing Engineers Limited
    and its wholly-owned subsidiary, US Bearings & Things,
    Inc., a long-established bearing and power transmission
    distributor. BC Bearing Engineers joined Motion Industries with
    22 locations throughout western Canada, and
    U.S. Bearings & Things with 21 branches in
    the western United States. In 2010, the Company also acquired
    TechCan Services, a full-service asset repair, fabrication and
    engineering business located in Alberta, Canada.

As of December 31, 2010, the Industrial Parts Group served
    more than 140,000 customers in all types of industries located
    throughout North America, including the food, forest products,
    primary metal, paper, mining, automotive, petrochemical and
    pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted
    specialty industries such as power generation, wastewater
    treatment facilities, wind power generation, solar power,
    government projects, pipelines, railroad, ports, and others.
    Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with
    access to a database of 4.3 million parts. Additionally,
    late in 2010, Motion Industries was awarded a Government
    Services Administration (GSA) schedule becoming a supplier to
    provide government agencies in the U.S. access to more than
    985,000 product and replacement parts.

This group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies,
    achieved through inventory management and logistical solutions
    coupled with Motion Industries’ vast product knowledge and
    system capabilities. The Company meets the MRO demand of a large
    and fragmented market with high levels of service in the areas
    of asset management, inventory and logistics management, product
    application and utilization management processes. A highly
    developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and customer
    connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading

e-business

capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides
    integration between the Company’s information technology
    network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits
    for both the supplier and customer.



Distribution System

.  In North America,
    the Industrial Parts Group operated 488 branches, 9 distribution
    centers and 46 service centers as of December 31, 2010. The
    distribution centers stock and distribute more than 92,000
    different items purchased from more than 468 different
    suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and
    mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 37% of 2010
    total industrial product purchases were made from 10 major
    suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts
    Group’s branches located in 47 states, Puerto Rico,
    nine provinces in Canada, and Mexico. Each branch has warehouse
    facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory
    representative of the products used by customers in the
    respective market area served.

Products

.  The Industrial Parts Group
    distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its
    customers, primarily industrial concerns. Products include such
    items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains,
    gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and
    industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its
    offering to include systems and automation products in response
    to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process
    automation for full systems integration of plant equipment.
    Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to
    opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient
    product markets, leading to product offerings such as
    energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and
    environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this
    group’s business demands the maintenance of adequate
    inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery
    requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are
    installed by the customer or used in plant and facility
    maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from
    existing stock and deliveries are normally made within
    24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are
    on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with
    existing customers that represent approximately 40% of the
    annual sales volume.

Supply Agreements

.  Non-exclusive
    distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial
    Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements
    vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial
    Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such
    agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until
    terminated by mutual consent. The Company has return privileges
    with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
    inventory obsolescence.

Segment Data

.  In the year ended
    December 31, 2010, sales from the Company’s Industrial
    Parts Group approximated 31% of the Company’s net sales, as
    compared to 29% in 2009 and 32% in 2008. For additional segment
    information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

page F-1.

Competition

.  The industrial parts
    distribution business is highly competitive. The Industrial
    Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the
    distribution of such items, general line distributors and others
    who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial
    Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to
    the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on
    the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further
    information regarding competition in the industry is set forth
    in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face
    Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do
    Business.”

OFFICE
    PRODUCTS GROUP

The Office Products Group, operated through S. P. Richards
    Company (“S. P. Richards”), a wholly owned subsidiary
    of the Company, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. S. P.
    Richards is engaged in the wholesale distribution of a broad
    line of office and other business related products to business
    product resellers that are used in the daily operation of
    businesses, schools, offices and other institutions. Office
    products fall into the general categories of computer supplies,
    imaging products, office furniture, office machines, general
    office products, school supplies, cleaning and breakroom
    supplies, and healthcare products.

The Office Products Group is represented in Canada through S. P.
    Richards Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
    headquartered near Toronto, Ontario. S. P. Richards Canada
    services office product resellers throughout Canada from
    locations in Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg.

Distribution System

.  The Office
    Products Group distributes more than 50,000 items to nearly
    4,000 business product resellers throughout the United States
    and Canada from a network of 43 distribution centers. In 2010,
    the Company completed the installation of new pick to voice
    technology in all U.S. distribution centers. In addition,
    new conveyors with inline scales and automated sortation were
    installed in four distribution centers and energy



conservation projects creating better lighting, lower energy
    usage and usage of motion sensitive lighting were completed in
    12 distribution centers. This network of strategically located
    distribution centers provides overnight delivery of the
    Company’s comprehensive product offering. Approximately 50%
    of the Company’s 2010 total office products purchases were
    made from 10 major suppliers.

The Office Products Group sells strictly to resellers of office
    products. These resellers include independently owned office
    product dealers, national office product superstores and mass

Segment Data

.  In the year ended
    December 31, 2010, sales from the Company’s Office
    Products Group approximated 15% of the Company’s net sales,
    as compared to 16% in 2009 and 2008. For additional segment
    information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

Competition

.  The office products
    distribution business is highly competitive. In the distribution
    of its product offering to resellers, S. P. Richards competes
    with many other wholesale distributors, as well as with certain
    manufacturers of office products. S. P. Richards competes
    primarily on price, product offerings, service, marketing
    programs and brand recognition. Further information regarding
    competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A.
    Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the
    Industries in Which We Do Business.”

ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC
    MATERIALS GROUP

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group was formed on
    July 1, 1998 through the acquisition of EIS, Inc.
    (“EIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
    headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. This Group distributes
    materials to more than 20,000 electrical and electronic
    manufacturers in North America. With 33 branch locations in the
    United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and
    Canada, this Group distributes over 100,000 items including
    wire and cable, insulating and conductive materials, assembly
    tools and test equipment. EIS also has three manufacturing
    facilities that provide custom fabricated parts.

Distribution System

.  The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group provides distribution
    services to OEM’s, motor repair shops and a broad variety
    of industrial assembly markets. EIS actively utilizes its

e-commerce

Internet site to present its products to customers while
    allowing these on-line visitors to conveniently purchase from a
    large product assortment.



Electrical and electronic products are distributed from
    warehouse locations in major user markets throughout the United
    States, as well as in Mexico and Canada. The Company has return
    privileges with some of its suppliers, which have protected the
    Company from inventory obsolescence.

Products

.  The Electrical/Electronic
    Materials Group distributes a wide variety of products to
    customers from over 350 vendors. These products include custom
    fabricated flexible materials that are used as components within
    a customer’s manufactured finished product in a variety of
    market segments. Among the products distributed and fabricated
    are such items as magnet wire, conductive materials, electrical
    wire and cable, insulating and shielding materials, assembly
    tools, test equipment, adhesives and chemicals, pressure
    sensitive tapes, solder, anti-static products and thermal
    management products. To meet the prompt delivery demands of its
    customers, this Group maintains large inventories. The majority
    of sales are on open account. Approximately 45% of 2010 total
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group purchases were made from
    10 major suppliers.

Integrated Supply

.  The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group’s integrated supply
    programs are a part of the marketing strategy, as a greater
    number of customers — especially national
    accounts — are given the opportunity to participate in
    this low-cost, high-service capability. The Group developed AIMS
    (Advanced Inventory Management System), a totally integrated,
    highly automated solution for inventory management. The
    Group’s Integrated Supply offering also includes SupplyPro,
    an electronic vending dispenser used to eliminate costly tool
    cribs, or in-house stores, at customer warehouse facilities.

Segment Data

.  In the year ended
    December 31, 2010, sales from the Company’s
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group approximated 4% of the
    Company’s net sales, as compared to 3% in 2009 and 4% in
    2008. For additional segment information, see Note 10 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth beginning
    on

page F-1.

Competition

.  The electrical and
    electronics distribution business is highly competitive. The
    Electrical/Electronic Materials Group competes with other
    distributors specializing in the distribution of electrical and
    electronic products, general line distributors and, to a lesser
    extent, manufacturers that sell directly to customers. EIS
    competes primarily on factors of price, product offerings and
    service. Further information regarding competition in the
    industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the
    Industries in Which We Do Business.”

RISK
    FACTORS

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we
    file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public and in
    materials that we make available on our website, constitute
    forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor
    provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995. Senior officers may also make verbal statements to
    analysts, investors, the media and others that are
    forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate, for
    example, to future operations, prospects, strategies, financial
    condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings),
    industry conditions and demand for our products and services.
    The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve
    risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our
    expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently
    available information, you are cautioned not to place undue
    reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or
    events may differ materially from those indicated in our
    forward-looking statements as a result of various important
    factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those
    discussed below.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are
    made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its
    forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are
    advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on
    related subjects in our subsequent

Forms 10-Q,

Form 8-K

and other reports to the SEC.

Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that,
    if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our
    business or could cause our actual results to differ materially
    from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
    in this report and in the other public statements we make.
    Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other
    risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may
    emerge at any



time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to
    which they may affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations or the trading price of our securities.

Our
    business will be adversely affected if demand for our products
    slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we
    distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.

With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher
    vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
    manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance
    offered on new vehicles;

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old
    and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the
    original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more
    maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;

•

gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from
    using their vehicles;

•

changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely
    more on other transportation;

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair
    information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by
    governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all
    diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the
    vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and

•

the economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause
    consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer
    discretionary spending.

With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors
    are:

•

the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity
    utilization, as these indices reflect the need for industrial
    replacement parts;

•

changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute
    for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an
    index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing
    economy, while a reading below 50 implies contracting
    manufacturing economy;

•

the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and
    the trend of manufacturing operations being moved
    overseas; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our office products group, the primary factors
    are:

•

the level of unemployment, especially as it relates to white
    collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for business
    products; and

•

the economy in general.

With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the
    primary factors are:

•

changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute
    for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an
    index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing
    economy, while a reading below 50 implies contracting
    manufacturing economy; and

•

the economy in general.



Uncertainty
    and/or deterioration in general macro-economic conditions,
    including unemployment, inflation or deflation, high energy
    costs, uncertain credit markets, or other economic conditions,
    could have a negative impact on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business and operating results may in the future be
    adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions,
    including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and
    business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile
    exchange rates, and other challenges that could affect the
    global economy. Both our commercial and retail customers may
    experience deterioration of their financial resources, which
    could result in existing or potential customers delaying or
    canceling plans to purchase our products. Our vendors could
    experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability
    to fulfill their obligations to us. Future weakness in the
    global economy could adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows in future periods.

We
    depend on our relationships with our vendors, and a disruption
    of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’
    operations could harm our business.

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial
    parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our
    business depends on developing and maintaining close and
    productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our
    vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many
    factors outside our control, including, without limitation, raw
    material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity, labor
    disputes, transportation disruptions or weather conditions,
    could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to
    us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner.
    Furthermore, financial or operational difficulties with a
    particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost
    of the products or decrease the quality of the products we
    purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the
    number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and
    could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. In
    our automotive business, the number of vendors could decrease
    considerably, and the prices charged to us by the remaining
    vendors could increase, to the extent that vehicle production
    slows due to a decline in consumer spending and, possibly, the
    failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers. We
    would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel
    the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory
    obsolescence.

We
    face substantial competition in the industries in which we do
    business.

The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and
    electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many
    factors, including name recognition, product availability,
    customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences,
    store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer
    competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we
    may be forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a
    material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased
    competition among distributors of automotive and industrial
    parts, office products and electronic materials, including
    internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations. The Company anticipates no
    decline in competition in any of its four business segments in
    the foreseeable future.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is
    highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of
    competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional
    auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local
    automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that
    supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass
    merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products
    and regional and local full service automotive repair shops.
    Furthermore, the automotive aftermarket has experienced
    consolidation in recent years. Consolidation among our
    competitors could further enhance their financial position,
    provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices
    to customers for whom we compete, and allow them to achieve
    increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that
    enable them to more effectively compete for customers. If we are
    unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies
    or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we
    could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.



We may
    not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives
    in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and
    earnings, which could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four
    business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the
    introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic
    expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets,
    enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross
    margin and cost savings initiatives. If we are unable to
    implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if
    these initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
    adversely affected.

Successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on
    factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other
    industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that
    may be beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors
    contained in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,”
    adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our
    business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows:

•

the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to
    reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase
    promotional spending;

•

our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to
    meet customers’ needs for our products in a timely manner;

•

our ability to successfully enter new markets;

•

our ability to effectively manage our costs;

•

our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and
    successfully integrate acquired businesses in our existing
    operations; and

•

the economy in general.

Because
    we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject
    to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur
    substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other
    costs.

We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from
    customers, employees or other third parties for various actions.
    The damages sought against us in some of these litigation
    proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability
    insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the
    claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or
    if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have
    a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal, state and
    local laws and governmental regulations relating to
    environmental protection, product quality standards, building
    and zoning requirements, as well as employment law matters. If
    we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations,
    we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or
    sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In
    addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation
    measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant
    with any existing or future laws or regulations.

PROPERTIES

.

The Company’s headquarters and Automotive Parts Group
    headquarters are located in two adjacent office buildings owned
    by the Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group currently operates 58
    NAPA Distribution Centers in the United States distributed among
    eight geographic divisions. Approximately 90% of the
    distribution center properties are owned by the Company. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company operated approximately 1,000
    NAPA AUTO PARTS stores



located in 42 states, and the Company owned either a
    noncontrolling or controlling interest in approximately
    19 additional auto parts stores located in three states.
    Other than NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located within Company owned
    distribution centers, the majority of the automotive parts
    stores in which the Company has an ownership interest were
    operated in leased facilities. In addition, NAPA Canada/UAP
    operates 12 distribution centers and approximately 189
    automotive parts and Traction stores in Canada, and Auto Todo
    operates ten distribution centers and eight stores and tire
    centers in Mexico. These operations are conducted in leased
    facilities.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group also operates three
    Balkamp distribution centers, four Rayloc rebuilding and
    distribution facilities and two transfer and shipping
    facilities. Finally, Altrom Canada operates 15 import parts
    distribution centers, Altrom America operates two import parts
    distribution centers and the Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates
    one TW distribution center, which serves 23 Traction stores of
    which 15 are company owned and located in the US. These
    operations are operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Industrial Parts Group, operating through
    Motion and Motion Canada, operates nine distribution centers, 46
    service centers and 488 branches. Approximately 90% of these
    branches are operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Office Products Group operates 38 facilities
    in the United States and five facilities in Canada distributed
    among the Group’s five geographic divisions. Approximately
    75% of these facilities are operated in leased buildings.

The Company’s Electrical/Electronic Materials Group
    operates in 30 locations in the United States, one location in
    Puerto Rico, one location in the Dominican Republic, three
    locations in Mexico and one location in Canada. All of this
    Group’s 36 facilities are operated in leased buildings
    except one facility, which is owned.

We believe that our facilities on the whole are in good
    condition, are adequately insured, are fully utilized and are
    suitable and adequate for the conduct of our current operations.

For additional information regarding rental expense on leased
    properties, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements set forth beginning on

ITEM 3

.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental
    proceedings, many involving routine litigation incidental to the
    businesses, including approximately 1,900 product liability
    lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of automotive
    parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal
    injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts
    distributed by the Company. While litigation of any type
    contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that
    its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably
    anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary
    course of the Company’s business and that resolution of
    these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business, results of operations or financial
    condition.

In constructing the peer group composite index (“Peer
    Index”) for use in the stock performance graph above, the
    Company used the shareholder returns of various publicly held
    companies (weighted in accordance with each company’s stock
    market capitalization at December 31, 2005 and including
    reinvestment of dividends) that compete with the Company in
    three industry segments: automotive parts, industrial parts and
    office products (each group of companies included in the Peer
    Index as competing with the Company in a separate industry
    segment is hereinafter referred to as a “Peer Group”).
    Included in the automotive parts Peer Group are those companies
    making up the Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index (the Company
    is a member of such industry group, and its individual
    shareholder return was included when calculating the Peer Index
    results set forth in the performance graph). Included in the
    industrial parts Peer Group are Applied Industrial Technologies,
    Inc. and Kaman Corporation and included in the office products
    Peer Group is United Stationers Inc. The Peer Index does not
    break out a separate electrical/electronic peer group due to the
    fact that there is currently no true market comparative to EIS.
    The electrical/electronic component of sales is redistributed to
    the Company’s other segments on a pro rata basis to
    calculate the final Peer Index.



In determining the Peer Index, each Peer Group was weighted to
    reflect the Company’s annual net sales in each industry
    segment. Each industry segment of the Company comprised the
    following percentages of the Company’s net sales for the
    fiscal years shown:

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

.

OVERVIEW

Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the
    distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial
    replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic
    materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating
    back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In
    2010, the Company conducted business throughout the United
    States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico from approximately 2,000
    locations.

We recorded consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 11% compared
    to $10.1 billion in 2009. Consolidated net income for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 was $476 million, up 19%
    from $400 million in 2009. The improving market conditions
    in the industries that we serve combined with our internal
    growth initiatives drove the Company’s strong performance
    in 2010.

The 11% sales growth in 2010 follows a 9% decrease in revenues
    in 2009 and a 2% increase in revenues in 2008. Our 19% increase
    in net income follows a 16% and 6% decrease in net income in
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Throughout this three year period,
    the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of
    our four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including
    the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic
    expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets,
    enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross
    margin and cost savings initiatives. The effects of the economic
    slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of
    2008, adversely impacted the benefit of these initiatives
    through 2009. In 2010, however, the recovering economy served to
    further support the benefits of our internal growth initiatives.

With regard to the December 31, 2010 consolidated balance
    sheet, the Company’s cash balance of $530 million was
    up $193 million or 57% from $337 million at
    December 31, 2009. This increase marks the second
    consecutive year the Company has significantly improved its cash
    position and relates to the increase in net income in 2010 and
    an improved working capital position for both years. Accounts
    receivable increased by approximately 15%,



relatively in-line with our sales increase in the fourth quarter
    of the year and inventory was up slightly, including
    acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $281 million or
    26% from the prior year, due primarily to improved payment terms
    with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives
    such as a procurement card program. Total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 was unchanged from $500 million at
    December 31, 2009.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Our results of operations are summarized below for the three
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Net
    Sales

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010
    totaled $11.2 billion, an 11% increase from 2009 driven by
    sales growth in all four of our business segments. The
    Industrial and Electrical business segments experienced the
    greatest percentage increases for the year, as the manufacturing
    sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to
    2009. These businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010.
    Sales for the Automotive business segment were much improved in
    2010 as well, primarily due to the benefits of well executed
    internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy.
    Cumulatively, prices in 2010 were up approximately 1% in the
    Automotive segment, up approximately 3% in the Industrial
    segment, up approximately 4% in the Electrical segment and
    approximately flat in the Office segment.

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009
    totaled $10.1 billion, a 9% decrease from 2008. Each of our
    four businesses experienced sales decreases, with the Industrial
    and Electrical business segments showing the most significant
    declines, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was
    severely impacted by the weak economic conditions, which we
    began to experience in the latter part of 2008. The general
    weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and
    industrial production and higher unemployment appeared to
    stabilize over the last half of 2009. Among the four quarters in
    2009, the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in
    each business segment. Cumulatively, prices in 2009 were down
    approximately 3% in the Automotive segment, approximately flat
    in the Industrial segment and up approximately 4% in the Office
    segment and 2% in the Electrical segment.

Automotive
    Group

Net sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) were
    $5.6 billion in 2010, an increase of 7% from 2009. Sales
    improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales
    initiatives and the stronger economy, which drove increased
    demand for automotive maintenance and supply items. Automotive
    revenues were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by 7%
    increases in the second and third quarters, and a 9% increase in
    the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales
    for the year include the effect of currency, which positively
    impacted sales by approximately 2%.

Automotive sales were $5.2 billion in 2009, a decrease of
    2% from 2008. Sales were impacted by the soft economy in 2009,
    which reduced the overall level of consumer spending and,
    specifically, the demand for automotive maintenance and supply
    items. The first half of the year proved to be the most
    challenging, with Automotive sales down 7% and 5% in the first
    and second quarters, respectively. Sales were down 1% in the
    third quarter followed by a 6% increase in the fourth quarter.
    Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year
    include acquisitions, which had an approximately 1% positive
    effect on sales, and the effect of currency, which negatively
    impacted sales by approximately 2%.



Industrial
    Group

Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group
    (“Industrial”), were $3.5 billion in 2010, an
    increase of 22% compared to 2009. Several factors contributed to
    the sales increase for this group, including the positive impact
    of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in
    the manufacturing sector of the economy served by Industrial.
    This was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the
    manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization
    indices, which this group tends to track. Also in 2010, sales
    were positively impacted by acquisitions, which accounted for
    approximately 5% of Industrial’s sales growth for the year.
    As a result of these several factors, Industrial revenues were
    up 9% in the first quarter of 2010, up 26% in the second
    quarter, then up 29% and 24% in the third and fourth quarters,
    respectively.

Net sales were $2.9 billion in 2009, a decrease of 18%
    compared to 2008. Through the first three quarters of the year,
    sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of
    very low manufacturing activity, as evidenced by the reported
    levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity
    utilization and its negative impact on demand for industrial
    products. This weakness was widespread, as we experienced sales
    declines in nearly all of our major customer categories. The
    industrial indices we follow showed some early signs of
    stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight
    strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth
    quarter. Industrial sales were down 11% in the fourth quarter,
    which marked a significant improvement from the declines of the
    first three quarters of the year. In 2009, sales were positively
    impacted by several acquisitions, which contributed
    approximately 3% to sales for the year.

Office
    Group

Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group
    (“Office”), were $1.6 billion in 2010, up
    slightly compared to the prior year. Office revenues stabilized
    in 2010 relative to prior year trends, although the office
    products industry continued to experience soft market conditions
    throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and
    the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels. Sales
    decreased approximately 1% in the first and second quarters,
    were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3% in the fourth
    quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter increase is significant, as
    the industry-wide slowdown in office products consumption has
    pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of
    2010 marks the first positive sales comparison for Office since
    the second quarter of 2007.

Net sales were $1.6 billion in 2009, down 5% compared to
    2008 and the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for
    Office. This three year sales trend reflects the negative impact
    of higher white collar and service unemployment on office
    products consumption, which has affected the office products
    industry since 2007. In 2009, sales improved sequentially, with
    decreases of 7%, 6%, 5% and 4% in the first, second, third and
    fourth quarters, respectively. For the year, sales were
    positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008,
    which contributed nearly 3% to sales in Office. The increase in
    net sales due to acquisitions, as well as our sales initiatives,
    was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the
    office products industry.

Electrical
    Group

Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group
    (“Electrical”), increased to $450 million in
    2010, up 30% from 2009. Electrical sales increased by 16% in the
    first quarter, and this was followed by increases of 32% in the
    second quarter, 31% in the third quarter and 40% in the fourth
    quarter. The revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales
    initiatives, which were strongly supported by manufacturing
    expansion during the year, as measured by the Institute for
    Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index. In addition,
    acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9% to
    Electrical’s sales growth for the year.

Net sales decreased to $346 million in 2009, down 26% from
    2008. Electrical sales declined by 25% in the first quarter, 34%
    in the second quarter and 30% in the third quarter. For the
    fourth quarter, sales were down 12%. Manufacturing contraction,
    as measured by the Institute for Supply Management’s
    Purchasing Managers Index, was evident through June and then
    began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year.
    This factor explains the quarterly sales trends at Electrical in
    2009. Acquisitions had less than a 1% positive impact on
    Electrical sales in 2009.



Cost
    of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold was $8.0 billion, $7.0 billion and
    $7.7 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 13%
    increase in cost of goods sold from 2009 to 2010 is directly
    related to the sales increase for the same period. Cost of goods
    sold represented 71.0% of net sales in 2010, 70.1% of net sales
    in 2009 and 70.3% of net sales in 2008. The increase in cost of
    goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2010 relative to 2009
    and 2008 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments
    implemented in Automotive during 2009 as well as ongoing
    competitive pricing pressures in Office. These factors more than
    offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing
    strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize
    material acquisition costs.

In 2010, all four of our business segments experienced vendor
    price increases, although the Automotive and Office increases
    were relatively immaterial. In 2009, our Office and Electrical
    business segments experienced vendor price increases. Industrial
    was flat and Automotive pricing was down for the year. In 2008,
    all four of our business segments experienced vendor price
    increases. In any year where we experience price increases, we
    are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along
    to them.

Operating
    Expenses

Selling, administrative and other expenses
    (“SG&A”) increased by $147 million or 7% to
    $2.4 billion in 2010, representing 21.1% of net sales and
    down from 22.1% of net sales in 2009. SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due
    primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated
    with the 11% sales increase for the year. In addition,
    management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as
    personnel, freight, fleet and logistics have served to further
    improve the Company’s cost structure. After reducing the
    size of its workforce by approximately 12% during 2008 and 2009,
    the Company added back only 1% of that in 2010 (including
    acquisitions), despite the 11% increase in revenues. In total,
    of the estimated $70 million cost savings in 2009, the
    Company estimates that it added back approximately
    $20 million in costs in 2010, primarily associated with the
    increase in sales and earnings. Our management teams remain
    focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost
    structure in our businesses. Depreciation and amortization
    expense in 2010 was $89 million, down slightly from 2009.
    The provision for doubtful accounts was $11 million in
    2010, down 61% from $28 million in 2009. The decrease in
    bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections
    environment in 2010 relative to the prior year. We believe the
    Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at
    December 31, 2010.

In 2009, SG&A was $2.2 billion, down $140 million
    or 6% from 2008 and representing 22.1% of net sales. This
    compared to 21.4% of net sales in 2008. This percentage increase
    was primarily due to the loss of expense leverage associated
    with the 9% sales decrease for the year. During 2009, management
    implemented extensive cost control initiatives to offset this
    loss of leverage. These measures eliminated approximately
    $70 million in operating costs and helped drive the
    decrease in absolute SG&A dollars for the year.
    Depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was
    $90 million, up slightly from 2008. The provision for
    doubtful accounts was $28 million in 2009, up 17% from a
    $24 million bad debt expense in 2008.

Total share-based compensation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $7.0 million,
    $8.6 million, and $13.0 million, respectively. Refer
    to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information regarding share-based compensation.

Non-Operating
    Expenses and Income

Non-operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest
    expense was $28 million in 2010 and 2009 and
    $32 million in 2008. The decrease in expense relative to
    2008 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain
    long-term debt, effective November 2008.

In “Other”, interest income net of noncontrolling
    interests has increased in each of the last two years due
    primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of
    certain noncontrolling interests in 2009.

Income
    Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes was $762 million in 2010, an
    increase of 18.3% from $644 million in 2009. As a
    percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 6.8% in
    2010, reflecting an increase from 6.4% in 2009. In



2009, income before income taxes of $644 million was down
    16.0% from $768 million in 2008 and as a percentage of net
    sales was 6.4%, a decrease from 7.0% in 2008.

Automotive
    Group

Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net
    sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.5%
    in 2010 from 7.4% in 2009. The improvement in operating margin
    for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense
    leverage associated with Automotive’s 7% sales increase for
    the year. Automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and
    control costs are intended to further improve its operating
    margin in the years ahead.

Automotive’s operating margin increased to 7.4% in 2009
    from 7.2% in 2008. The improvement in operating margin for 2009
    is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures
    implemented during 2008 and 2009.

Industrial
    Group

Industrial’s operating margin increased to 7.3% in 2010
    from 5.6% in 2009. The increase in operating margin in 2010 is
    due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated
    with a 22% sales increase, cost savings and increased volume
    incentives. Industrial will continue to focus on its sales
    initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating
    margin in the years ahead.

Industrial’s operating margin decreased to 5.6% in 2009
    from 8.4% in 2008. The decrease in operating margin in 2009 was
    primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial
    demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of
    2008. These conditions led to lower sales volumes in 2009, which
    severely impacted our expense leverage despite significant cost
    reduction efforts.

Office
    Group

The operating margin in Office increased to 8.0% in 2010 from
    7.7% in 2009. The increase in operating margin in 2010 reflects
    the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined
    with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers. The
    increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales
    growth and related increase in purchase volumes, which allowed
    us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers.

The operating margin in Office was 7.7% in 2009, down from 8.3%
    in 2008. The prevailing weakness in the office products industry
    that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margin at
    Office in 2009.

Electrical
    Group

The operating margin in Electrical decreased to 6.9% in 2010
    from 7.3% in 2009. The decrease in operating margin is mainly
    due to escalating copper prices during the year, which generally
    do not affect profit dollars, but negatively impact margins as
    copper is generally billed to customers at cost. The margin
    pressures associated with this industry standard pricing
    practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger
    manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage
    associated with a 30% sales increase.

The operating margin in Electrical decreased to 7.3% in 2009
    from 7.9% in 2008. The decrease in operating margin was
    primarily a function of weak market conditions. This factor
    outweighed the benefits of Electrical’s sales initiatives
    and expense savings.

Income
    Taxes

The effective income tax rate of 37.6% in 2010 was down from
    38.0% in 2009. The decrease from 2009 is attributable to
    favorable foreign income taxes for the year. The income tax rate
    decreased to 38.0% in 2009 from 38.1% in 2008. The decrease from
    the 2008 rate is mainly due to tax-free income in 2009
    associated with a Company retirement plan.



Net
    Income

Net income was $476 million in 2010, an increase of 19%
    from $400 million in 2009. On a per share diluted basis,
    net income was $3.00 in 2010 compared to $2.50 in 2009, up 20%.
    Net income in 2010 was 4.2% of net sales compared to 4.0% of net
    sales in 2009.

Net income of $400 million in 2009 was down 16% from
    $475 million in 2008. On a per share diluted basis, net
    income of $2.50 in 2009 was down 14% compared to $2.92 in 2008.
    Net income in 2009 was 4.0% of net sales compared to 4.3% of net
    sales in 2008.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Our cash balance of $530 million at December 31, 2010
    was up $193 million or 57% from December 31, 2009, due
    primarily to the increase in net income in 2010 and an improved
    working capital position relative to 2009. The Company’s
    accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2010 increased
    by approximately 15% from the prior year, which reflects the
    Company’s 14% sales increase for the fourth quarter of
    2010. Inventory at December 31, 2010 was up slightly from
    December 31, 2009, which is well below the Company’s
    increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions.
    Accounts payable increased $281 million or approximately
    26% from December 31, 2009 due primarily to increased
    inventory purchases related to the Company’s sales
    increase, improved payment terms with certain suppliers and
    other payables initiatives such as the ongoing expansion of our
    procurement card program. Goodwill and other intangible assets
    increased by $38 million or 22% from December 31, 2009
    due to the Company’s acquisitions during the year. The
    change in our December 31, 2010 balance for the pension and
    other post-retirement benefits liabilities, down
    $41 million or approximately 14% from December 31,
    2009, is primarily due to a change in funded status of the
    Company’s pension and other post-retirement plans in 2010
    and a $91 million pension contribution during the year.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash
    flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private
    issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million
    of total debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, of which
    $250 million matures in November 2011 and is accounted for
    as current debt at December 31, 2010. The remaining
    $250 million matures in November 2013. In addition, the
    Company has available a $350 million unsecured revolving
    line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the line of
    credit at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The capital and
    credit markets were volatile over the last few years, although
    these conditions did not materially impact our access to these
    markets. Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and
    available short-term and long-term sources of capital are
    sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, including
    working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest
    payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions,
    income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and
    contemplated acquisitions.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.2 to 1
    at December 31, 2010, and before consideration of current
    debt, was 2.6 to 1. This compares to 2.9 to 1 at
    December 31, 2009. Our liquidity position remains solid.
    The Company’s $500 million in total debt outstanding
    at December 31, 2010 is unchanged from 2009.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities:

The Company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by
    operating activities totaled $679 million in 2010. This
    reflects a 20% decrease from 2009, as working capital as a
    source of cash was $129 million less in 2010 relative to
    2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by $35 million
    from 2009. These items were partially offset by a
    $76 million increase in net income. Net cash provided by
    operating activities of $845 million in 2009 represents a
    59% increase from 2008 and primarily relates to the
    $368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital
    requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and
    accounts payable, net of the $76 million decrease in net
    income from 2008.

Net Cash
    Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash flow used in investing activities was $172 million
    in 2010 compared to $264 million in 2009, a decrease of
    35%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was
    $44 million less than in 2009, while capital expenditures
    increased by $16 million for the year. The decrease in
    investing activities was primarily due to a $73 million
    purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement
    in 2009. This transaction also explains the increase in
    investing activities in 2009 from 2008, net of a
    $36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from
    2008. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was
    relatively consistent with 2008.

Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities:

The Company used $321 million of cash in financing
    activities in 2010, a 3% decrease from the $330 million
    used in financing activities in 2009. Cash used in financing
    activities in 2009 was down 30% from the $473 million used
    in 2008. For the three years presented, net cash used in
    financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to
    shareholders and repurchases of the Company’s common stock.
    The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $258 million,
    $254 million and $252 million during 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing
    dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2010,
    2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased $75 million,
    $26 million and $273 million, respectively, of the
    Company’s common stock. We expect to remain active in our
    share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares
    repurchased will vary annually.

Notes
    and Other Borrowings

The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving
    line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions,
    which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus
    .30% (0.56% at December 31, 2010). At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the line of
    credit. Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance
    reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had
    unused letters of credit of approximately $50 million
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had unsecured Senior
    Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing
    arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series B, 6.23%
    fixed, due 2011; and $250 million senior unsecured note,
    4.67% fixed, due 2013. These borrowings contain covenants
    related to a maximum

debt-to-capitalization

ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the
    Company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 5.45% at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Total interest expense, net of
    interest income, for all borrowings was $26.6 million,
    $27.1 million and $29.8 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Contractual
    and Other Obligations

In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the
    transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store
    properties and immediately leased the properties back over a
    lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an
    operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to
    approximately $56 million. The Company realized a net gain
    of approximately $20 million, which was deferred and is
    being amortized over the lease term.



The following table shows the Company’s approximate
    obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit
    facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual
    obligations as of December 31, 2010:

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows
    associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2010, the Company is unable to make reasonably
    reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the
    respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $50 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the
    contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income
    taxes.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and
    other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We
    are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase
    orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase
    orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than
    binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current
    distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short
    time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements
    for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum
    quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
    owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other
    affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity
    ownership interest (affiliates). The Company’s maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these
    independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total
    borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. To date, the
    Company has had no significant losses in connection with
    guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’
    borrowings. The following table shows the Company’s
    approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010:

In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans
    that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from
    time to time. Contributions in 2010 were $91 million. We
    expect to make a $52 million cash contribution to our
    qualified defined benefit plans in 2011, and contributions
    required for 2011 and future years will depend on a number of
    unpredictable factors including the market performance of the
    plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that
    affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations.

Share
    Repurchases

In 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million
    shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase
    approximately 16.0 million shares at December 31, 2010.



CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires
    management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales
    and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
    be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions.

We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies
    that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and
    judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it
    requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions
    about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is
    made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been
    used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably
    likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the
    consolidated financial statements. Management believes the
    following critical accounting policies reflect its most
    significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements. For further information
    on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories —
    Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and
    estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto.
    Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as
    the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not
    highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return
    under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no
    reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be
    discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with
    obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were
    to occur.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts — Methodology

The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable
    based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company
    estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of
    net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial
    estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware
    of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes
    in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company
    has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a
    general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in
    which the Company operates could result in higher than expected
    defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad
    debts. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of
    $10.6 million, $28.5 million, and $23.9 million,
    respectively.

Consideration
    Received from Vendors

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year
    with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase
    incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase
    incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or
    other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these
    incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative
    purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases
    through the end of the year. While management believes the
    Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in
    2011 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will
    continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the
    future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes
    necessary to take advantage of such incentives.



Impairment
    of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and
    equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential
    impairment indicators. The Company’s judgments regarding
    the existence of impairment indicators are based on market
    conditions and operational performance, among other factors.
    Future events could cause the Company to conclude that
    impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a
    particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment
    also requires the Company to estimate future operating results
    and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any
    resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and
    Canada establish investment policies and strategies and
    regularly monitor the performance of the Company’s pension
    plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by
    the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives
    and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable
    pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary
    standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan
    funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth
    of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets
    from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results
    that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed
    long term rate of return. The Company’s investment strategy
    with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in
    excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% S&P 500
    Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI
    EAFE Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension
    plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the
    most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of
    return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions
    we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of
    compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and
    turnover rates.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as
    an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s
    asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s
    expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2011
    pension expense or income is 7.87% for the plans. The asset
    study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate
    duration of the Company’s benefit obligations, using
    capital market data and historical relationships.

The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension
    obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital
    market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched
    the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our
    pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad
    portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to
    select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching
    analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the
    plans of 5.74% at December 31, 2010.

Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans
    was $21.9 million, $7.3 million and $46.9 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The decreasing trend in pension cost from 2008 to
    2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent
    remeasurement which is discussed below, and the change in
    assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount
    rate and the rate of compensation increases. Refer to
    Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information regarding employee benefit plans.

In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non-cash
    curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization,
    which reduced the expected years of future service of employees
    covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.

In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the
    U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1,
    2010, future retirees no longer receive employer-provided
    medical benefits and current pre-65 retirees no longer receive
    employer-provided post-65 benefits (beyond an access-only
    arrangement).

    annual basic and diluted earnings per share.

The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the
    amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial
    statements. Specifically, the Company makes estimates and
    assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for
    the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and
    volume incentives earned, among others. Bad debts are accrued
    based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are
    estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels.
    Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and
    adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual October 31

book-to-physical

inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in
    deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting
    typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at
    year-end. The effect of these adjustments in 2010 and 2009 was
    not significant.

ITEM 7A

.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
    RISK

.

Although the Company does not face material risks related to
    interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to
    changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign
    currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.

Foreign
    Currency

The Company has translation gains or losses that result from
    translation of the results of operations of an operating
    unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars
    for consolidated financial statement purposes. The
    Company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is
    the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our
    Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure
    particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser
    extent, the Mexican peso, positively impacted our results for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

During 2010 and 2009, it was estimated that a 10% shift in
    exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and
    the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by
    approximately $140 million and $104 million,
    respectively.

Management’s
    conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls
    and procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC

Rule 13a-15(e).

Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end
    of the period covered by this report, to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed in the
    Company’s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO
    and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    report on internal control over financial reporting

Management’s
    Responsibility for the Financial Statements

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements and related information included herein for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The opinion of
    Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, on those consolidated
    financial statements is included herein. The primary
    responsibility for the integrity of the financial information
    included in this annual report rests with management. Such
    information was prepared in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances based on
    our best estimates and judgments and giving due consideration to
    materiality.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company’s internal control system was designed to
    provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of the Company’s published consolidated
    financial statements. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

i. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and

iii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
    effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
    financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010.

In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.”
    Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the
    Company’s operating effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. This report
    appears on

page F-3.

Audit
    Committee Responsibility

The Audit Committee of Genuine Parts Company’s Board of
    Directors is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the
    Company’s financial reports and accounting practices to
    ascertain that they are within acceptable limits of sound
    practice in such matters. The membership of the Committee
    consists of non-employee Directors. At periodic meetings, the
    Audit Committee discusses audit and financial reporting matters
    and the internal audit function with representatives of
    financial management and with representatives from
    Ernst & Young LLP.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

The Board
    of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts Company

We have audited Genuine Parts Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Genuine Parts
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting section of the accompanying Report of Management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Genuine Parts Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, equity, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of
    Genuine Parts Company and our report dated February 25,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Financial
    Statements

The
    Board of Directors and Shareholders of Genuine Parts
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Genuine Parts Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Genuine Parts Company at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations
    and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Genuine Parts Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

Genuine

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2010

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Genuine Parts Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries
    (the Company) is a distributor of automotive replacement parts,
    industrial replacement parts, office products, and
    electrical/electronic materials. The Company serves a diverse
    customer base through more than 2,000 locations in North America
    and, therefore, has limited exposure from credit losses to any
    particular customer, region, or industry segment. The Company
    performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
    The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the
    financial statements were issued.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of the
    accounts of the Company. The net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests is not material to the Company’s
    consolidated net income. Significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may
    differ from those estimates and the differences could be
    material.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company records revenue when the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred, the Company’s price to the customer is fixed and
    determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery
    is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes
    the risks and rewards of ownership.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into
    U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates,
    respectively. The foreign currency translation adjustment is
    included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) income.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
    equivalents.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts
    receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the
    Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a
    percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience.
    This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company
    becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
    its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a
    result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable.
    While the Company has a large customer base that is
    geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of
    the industry segments in which the Company operates could result
    in higher than expected defaults, and, therefore, the need to
    revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recorded
    provisions for bad debts of approximately $10,597,000,
    $28,463,000, and $23,883,000, respectively. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the allowance for doubtful accounts was
    approximately $15,599,000 and $16,590,000, respectively.

    Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Merchandise
    Inventories, Including Consideration Received From
    Vendors

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
    market. Cost is determined by the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for a majority of automotive parts,
    electrical/electronic materials, and industrial parts, and by
    the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method for office products and certain other
    inventories. If the FIFO method had been used for all
    inventories, cost would have been approximately $383,094,000 and
    $398,122,000 higher than reported at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. During 2010, reductions in inventory levels
    in industrial parts inventories resulted in liquidations of LIFO
    inventory layers. The effect of the LIFO liquidation in 2010 was
    to reduce cost of goods sold by approximately $25,000,000.
    During 2009, reductions in inventory levels in industrial and
    electrical parts inventories resulted in liquidations of LIFO
    inventory layers. The effect of the LIFO liquidation in 2009 was
    to reduce cost of goods sold by approximately $22,000,000.

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and
    estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically,
    these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of
    the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to
    obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor
    return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its
    inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future,
    its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving
    inventories would increase if such were to occur.

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year
    with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase
    incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase
    incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or
    other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these
    incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative
    purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases
    through the end of the year. While management believes the
    Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in
    2011 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will
    continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the
    future.

Prepaid
    Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of
    prepaid expenses and amounts due from vendors.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company reviews its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
    assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair
    value. The present value of future cash flows approach was used
    to determine any potential impairment. The Company determined
    that these assets were not impaired and, therefore, no
    impairments were recognized for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, or 2008. If an impairment occurs
    at a future date, it may have the effect of increasing the
    volatility of the Company’s earnings.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Buildings
    include certain leases capitalized at December 31, 2010 and
    2009. Depreciation and amortization is primarily determined on a
    straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life of
    each asset: buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years;
    machinery and equipment, 5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived
    Assets Other Than Goodwill

The Company assesses its long-lived assets other than goodwill
    for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze
    recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future
    cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these
    projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of
    assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. Impairment
    losses, if any, are measured based upon the difference between
    the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.

The Company’s post-employment and other benefit liabilities
    consist primarily of actuarially determined obligations and
    deferred compensation plans. See Note 4 for further
    discussion of the Company’s obligations under capital
    leases and the sale-leaseback transaction. Other taxes payable
    consists primarily of unrecognized tax benefits.

Insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the
    workers’ compensation program. The Company carries various
    large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for
    the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. The
    Company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on
    an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis
    calculates development factors, which are applied to total
    reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who
    underwrite the program. While the Company believes that the
    assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate,
    significant differences in actual experience or significant
    changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’
    compensation costs.

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority of group health
    insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported
    is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the
    Company’s claims administrators. While the Company believes
    that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are
    appropriate, significant differences from historical trends may
    materially impact financial results. These reserves are included
    in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
    sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable
    and trade accounts payable approximate their respective fair
    values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of fixed rate
    debt was approximately $529,000,000 and $533,000,000,
    respectively. The fair value of fixed rate debt is designated as
    Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (i.e. significant
    observable inputs) and is based primarily on the discounted
    value of future cash flows using current market interest rates
    offered for debt of similar credit risk and maturity.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are classified as selling,
    administrative and other expenses in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income and totaled approximately
    $150,000,000, $120,000,000, and $140,000,000 for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled
    $36,800,000, $44,500,000, and $42,800,000 in the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Accounting
    for Legal Costs

The Company’s legal costs expected to be incurred in
    connection with loss contingencies are expensed as such costs
    are incurred.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company maintains various long-term incentive plans, which
    provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs),
    performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based
    awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an
    amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess,
    if any, of the fair market value of the Company’s common
    stock on the date of exercise over the base value of the grant.
    The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of
    common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs
    represent a contingent right to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock at a future date. The majority of
    awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods
    ranging from one to five years and are expensed accordingly on a
    straight-line basis. The Company issues new shares upon exercise
    or conversion of awards under these plans.

Net
    Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net
    income by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted net
    income per common share includes the

F-12


Genuine
    Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and
    non-vested restricted stock awards options. Options to purchase
    approximately 4,500,000, 5,400,000 and 4,400,000 shares of
    common stock ranging from $37 — $49 per share were
    outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. These options were not included in the computation
    of diluted net income per common share because the options’
    exercise price was greater than the average market price of
    common stock.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the
    elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose
    entity. It also replaces the quantitative-based risks and
    rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a
    controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity
    with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the
    power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the guidance
    requires an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the
    primary beneficiary of the entity. The Company adopted the new
    guidance on January 1, 2010 and concluded that certain
    independently controlled automotive parts stores for which the
    Company guarantees debt are variable interest entities; however,
    the Company is not the primary beneficiary. These entities are
    discussed further in Note 8.

Credit
    Facilities

There were no amounts subject to variable rates at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The weighted average interest
    rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings was
    approximately 5.45% at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The Company maintains a $350,000,000 unsecured revolving line of
    credit with a consortium of financial institutions that matures
    in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.30% (0.56%
    at December 31, 2010).

The Company also has the option under this agreement to increase
    its borrowing an additional $200,000,000. No amounts were
    outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2010
    and 2009. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a
    maximum

debt-to-capitalization

ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants. Due to the workers’ compensation and
    insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company
    also had unused letters of credit of $50,419,000 and $50,403,000
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Leased
    Properties

In June 2003, the Company completed an amended and restated
    master agreement to the $85,000,000 construction and lease
    agreement (the Agreement). The lessor in the Agreement was an
    independent third-party limited liability company, which had as
    its sole member a publicly traded corporation. Properties
    acquired by the lessor were constructed

and/or

then
    leased to the Company under operating lease agreements. On
    June 26, 2009, the Agreement expired. In accordance with
    the Agreement, the Company purchased the properties from the
    lessor for $72,814,000, including closing costs. The properties
    are included in property, plant, and equipment in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Rent expense related to the Agreement is recorded under selling,
    administrative, and other expenses in our consolidated
    statements of income and was $489,000 and $2,586,000 for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the
    transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store
    properties and immediately leased the properties back over a
    lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an
    operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to
    approximately $56,000,000. The Company realized a net gain of
    approximately $20,000,000, which was deferred and is being
    amortized over the lease term. The unamortized portion of the
    deferred gain is included in other long-term liabilities in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, buildings include $3,080,000
    and $11,550,000 with accumulated depreciation of $1,787,000 and
    $7,823,000, respectively, for capital leases of distribution
    centers and stores. Depreciation expense for capital leases was
    approximately $1,133,000, $1,828,000, and $2,267,000 in 2010,
    2009, and 2008, respectively.

Share-Based
    Compensation

At December 31, 2010, total compensation cost related to
    nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately
    $6,900,000. The weighted-average period over which this
    compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately
    three years. The aggregate intrinsic value for options and RSUs
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately
    $67,100,000 and $17,500,000, respectively. The aggregate
    intrinsic value for options and RSUs vested totaled
    approximately $45,900,000 and $12,200,000 at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the
    weighted-average contractual life for outstanding and
    exercisable options and RSUs was six and five years,
    respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009,
    and 2008, $7,016,000, $8,578,000, and $12,977,000 of share-based
    compensation cost was recorded, respectively. The total income
    tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of income
    for share-based compensation arrangements was approximately
    $2,800,000, $3,400,000, and $5,200,000 for 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively. There have been no modifications to valuation
    methodologies or methods during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008 the fair
    value for options and SARs granted was estimated using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions, respectively: risk-free interest
    rate of 3.6% and 3.5%; dividend yield of 4.6% and 3.0%; annual
    historical volatility factor of the expected market price of the
    Company’s common stock of 19% and 17%; an average expected
    life and estimated turnover based on the historical pattern of
    existing grants of eight years and 4.0% to 6.0%, respectively.
    The fair value of RSUs is based on the price of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant. The Company had no
    grant activity for the year ended December 31, 2009. The
    total fair value of shares vested during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, was $9,200,000,
    $13,200,000, and $14,900,000, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used
    for income tax purposes. Undistributed earnings of the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
    indefinitely reinvested. As such, no U.S. federal and state
    income taxes have been provided thereon, and it is not
    practicable to determine the amount of the related

years ended prior to 2002. The Company is currently under audit
    in the United States and Canada. Some audits may conclude in the
    next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded
    in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement
    amounts. It is not possible to estimate the effect, if any, of
    the amount of such change during the next twelve months to
    previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with
    the audits. However, the Company does not anticipate total
    unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change during the
    year due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of

The amount of gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits,
    including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009 was approximately $50,216,000 and $41,013,000,
    respectively, of which approximately $18,189,000 and
    $15,129,000, respectively, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate. During the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company paid interest and penalties of
    approximately $272,000, $363,000, and $815,000, respectively.
    The Company had approximately $10,791,000 and $7,691,000 of
    accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. The Company recognizes potential interest
    and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of income tax expense.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company’s defined benefit pension plans cover most of
    its employees in the U.S. and Canada. The plan covering
    U.S. employees is noncontributory and benefits are based on
    the employees’ compensation during the highest five of
    their last ten years of credited service. The Canadian plan is
    contributory and benefits are based on career average
    compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute
    an amount equal to the minimum required contribution under
    ERISA. The Company may increase its contribution above the
    minimum if appropriate to its tax and cash position and the
    plans’ funded position.

In 2008, the U.S. defined benefit plan was amended to
    prohibit employees hired on or after March 1, 2008 from
    participating in the plan. The plan was also amended to freeze
    credited service for participants who do not meet certain age
    and length of service requirements as of December 31, 2008.
    However, the plan continues to reflect future pay increases for
    all participants.

In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4,298,000 non-cash
    curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization,
    which reduced the expected years of future service of employees
    covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.
    Curtailment accounting is required if an event eliminates, for a
    significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits
    for some or all of their future service.

The Company also sponsors supplemental retirement plans covering
    employees in the U.S. and Canada and other postretirement
    benefit plans in the U.S. The Company uses a measurement
    date of December 31st for its pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans.

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and
    Canada establish investment policies and strategies and
    regularly monitor the performance of the funds. The pension plan
    strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to
    achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in
    accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the
    U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The
    long-term primary objectives for the pension plans are to
    provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital,
    without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion
    of purchasing power, and provide investment results that meet or
    exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term
    rates of return. The Company’s investment strategy with
    respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess
    of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% S&P 500 Index, 5%
    Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE
    Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).

The fair values of the plan assets as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, by asset category, are shown in the tables below.
    Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the
    Company’s pension plan assets. The inputs or methodologies
    used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of
    the risk associated with investing in these securities.
    Level 1 represents observable market inputs that are
    unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
    active markets. Level 2 represents other significant
    observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar
    securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.) Level 3
    represents significant unobservable inputs (including the
    Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
    investments).

The valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that
    may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
    future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its
    valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
    market participants, the use of different methodologies or
    assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
    instruments could result in a different fair value measurement
    at the reporting date. Equity securities are valued at the
    closing price reported on the active market on which the
    individual securities are traded on the last day of the calendar
    plan year. Debt securities including corporate bonds,
    U.S. Government securities, and asset-backed securities are
    valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid

and/or

ask
    sides of the market for an investment as of the last day of the
    calendar plan year. Real estate value is based on the last
    appraised or interim valuation. The timing of the individual
    property appraisals is spread throughout the four quarters of
    the year.

Equity securities include Genuine Parts Company common stock in
    the amounts of $103,549,000 (7.2% of total plan assets) and
    $76,563,000 (6.3% of total plan assets) at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Dividend payments received by the
    plan on Company stock totaled approximately $3,308,000 and
    $3,227,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fees paid during the
    year for services rendered by parties in interest were based on
    customary and reasonable rates for such services.

The changes in the fair value measurement of plan assets using
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2010
    and 2009 were not material.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as
    an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s
    asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s
    expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2011
    pension cost or income is 7.87% for the plans. The asset study
    forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration
    of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market
    data and historical relationships.

For the pension benefits, the following table reflects the total

    paid in 2011, approximately $4,405,000 is expected to be paid
    from employer assets. For pension benefits, expected employer
    contributions reflect amounts expected to be contributed to
    funded plans. For other postretirement benefits, the following
    table’s employer contributions reflect only the
    Company’s share of the benefit cost. The expected benefit
    payments show the Company’s cost without regard to income
    from federal subsidy payments received pursuant to the Medicare
    Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
    (MMA). Expected federal subsidy payments, which reduce the
    Company’s cost for the plan, are shown separately.

A 7.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
    health care benefits was assumed on December 31, 2009. The
    rate was assumed to decrease ratably to 5% at December 31,
    2014, and thereafter. The effect of a one-percentage-point
    change in the assumed health care cost trend rate is not
    significant.

The Company has two defined contribution plans that cover
    substantially all of its domestic employees. The Company’s
    matching contributions are determined based on the
    employee’s participation in the U.S. pension plan.
    Pension plan participants who continue earning credited service
    after 2008 receive a matching contribution of 20% of the first
    6% of the employee’s salary. Other employees receive a
    matching contribution of 100% of the first 5% of the
    employee’s salary. Total plan expense for both plans was
    approximately $33,476,000 in 2010, $31,783,000 in 2009, and
    $7,252,000 in 2008.

8.

Guarantees

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
    controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain
    other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling
    equity ownership interest (affiliates). Presently, the
    independents are generally consolidated by unaffiliated
    enterprises that have a controlling financial interest through
    ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. The
    Company has no voting interest or other equity conversion rights
    in any of the independents. The Company does not control the
    independents or the affiliates, but receives a fee for the
    guarantee. The Company has concluded that the independents are
    variable interest entities, but that the Company is not the
    primary beneficiary. Specifically, the equity holders of the
    independents have the power to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance
    including, but not limited to, decisions about hiring and
    terminating personnel, local marketing and promotional
    initiatives, pricing and selling activities, credit decisions,
    monitoring and maintaining appropriate inventories, and store
    hours. Separately, the Company concluded the affiliates are not
    variable interest entities. The Company’s maximum exposure
    to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents
    and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings
    subject to the Company’s guarantee. While such borrowings
    of the independents and affiliates are outstanding, the Company
    is required to maintain compliance with certain covenants,
    including a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain
    limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2010,
    the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

At December 31, 2010, the total borrowings of the
    independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the Company
    were approximately $200,900,000. These loans generally mature
    over periods from one to six years. In the event that the
    Company is required to make payments in connection with
    guaranteed obligations of the

F-24


Genuine
    Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

independents or the affiliates, the Company would obtain and
    liquidate certain collateral (e.g., accounts receivable and
    inventory) to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under
    the guarantee. When it is deemed probable that the Company will
    incur a loss in connection with a guarantee, a liability is
    recorded equal to this estimated loss. To date, the Company has
    had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of
    independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings.

The Company has accrued for guarantees related to the
    independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These liabilities are not
    material to the financial position of the Company and are
    included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

9.

Acquisitions

During 2010, the Company acquired four companies in the
    Industrial and Electrical Groups for approximately $90,645,000.
    The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired
    and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of
    their respective acquisition dates. The results of operations
    for the acquired companies were included in the Company’s

The Company’s electrical/electronic materials segment
    distributes a wide variety of electrical/electronic materials,
    including insulating and conductive materials for use in
    electronic and electrical apparatus.

Inter-segment sales are not significant. Operating profit for
    each industry segment is calculated as net sales less operating
    expenses excluding general corporate expenses, interest expense,
    equity in income from investees, amortization, and
    noncontrolling interests. Approximately $68,200,000,
    $38,900,000, and $49,900,000 of income before income taxes was
    generated in jurisdictions outside the United States for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively. Net sales and net long-lived assets by country
    relate directly to the Company’s operations in the
    respective country. Corporate assets are principally cash and
    cash equivalents and headquarters’ facilities and equipment.

For management purposes, net sales by segment exclude the effect
    of certain discounts, incentives, and freight billed to
    customers. The line item “other” represents the net
    effect of the discounts, incentives, and freight billed to
    customers, which are reported as a component of net sales in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of income.
