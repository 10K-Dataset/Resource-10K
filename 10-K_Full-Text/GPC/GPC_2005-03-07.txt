Competition - General

. The distribution business, which includes all segments of the
Company’s business, is highly competitive with the principal methods of competition being product
quality, sufficiency of inventory, price and the ability to give the customer prompt and dependable
service. The Company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the
foreseeable future.

Employees

. As of December 31, 2004, the Company employed approximately 31,200 persons.

AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive
replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is the largest member of the National
Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide
nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In addition to over 320,000 available part numbers,
the Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory, cataloging, marketing, training
and other programs in the automotive aftermarket.

During 2004, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned in the
United States by the Company; automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in Canada
owned and operated by NAPA Canada/UAP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores
in the United States operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a minority or
majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations in which NAPA Canada/UAP
owns a 50% interest; distribution centers owned by Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), a majority-owned
subsidiary of the Company; rebuilding plants owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc
division; distribution centers of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive supplies owned and
operated by Johnson Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary; and automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V.
(“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of
Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair information company with over 35,000
North American subscribers linked to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product,
“Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other
than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United
States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUV’s, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and
farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for
such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive
aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers,
leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial
concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the

-2-


Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from more than 80 different suppliers,
approximately 51% of 2004 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers.
Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected
the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2004, the Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts
distribution centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,000 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO
PARTS stores located in 43 states. At December 31, 2004, Genuine Parts Company owned either a
minority or majority interest in 3 corporations, which operated approximately 22 auto parts stores
in 3 states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution, marketing and
rebuilding of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs
approximately 4,000 people. NAPA Canada/UAP operates a network of 14 distribution centers
supplying approximately 585 NAPA Canada/UAP stores and 72 TRACTION wholesalers, which supply parts
to small fleet owners and operators and are a significant supplier to the mining and forestry
industries. These include approximately 198 company owned stores, 21 joint venture or progressive
owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 438 independently owned
stores. NAPA Canada/UAP supplies bannered installers and independent installers in all provinces
of Canada, as well as networks of service station and repair shops operating under the banners of
national accounts. NAPA Canada/UAP is licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 9 distribution centers and 12 auto parts stores. Auto
Todo is licensed to and uses the NAPA® name in Mexico.

The Company’s distribution centers serve approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO
PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to
a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent
automotive parts stores account for approximately 25% of the Company’s total sales with no
automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common ownership
accounting for more than 0.5% of the total sales of the Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 320,000 different parts and related
supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility.
Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most
orders are filled and shipped the same day as received. The majority of sales are on terms that
require payment within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the
products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA® name, a mark
licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. Balkamp distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory
items for passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition,
Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges,
cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions.
Balkamp packages many of the approximately 27,000 products which constitute the “Balkamp” line of
products that are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are categorized in 160
different product groups purchased from more than 400 domestic suppliers and 130 foreign
manufacturers. In addition, Balkamp operates two Redistribution Centers that provide NAPA with over
300 SKUs of oils and chemicals. Balkamp also provides mill supplies and related items to the
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Motion Industries, Inc. for sale in its MI Industrial line of
merchandise. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing
promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has four distribution centers located in
Indianapolis and Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi and West Jordan, Utah.

Johnson Industries, Inc. (“Johnson”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is an
independent distributor of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive supplies. Johnson, founded in
1924, sells primarily to large fleets and new car dealers from a network of distribution centers
throughout the U.S.

-3-


The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates five plants where certain small
automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are distributed to the members of NAPA under the NAPA®
brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2004, sales from the Automotive Parts Group
approximated 52% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 53% in 2003 and 52% in 2002.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and the range of
services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its
automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of computerized NAPA AUTO PARTS
catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company
offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on
topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and
retirement benefit plans, marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and
training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive
Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO
PARTS store.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an inventory classification
system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics,
technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises
an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its
NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its
classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes with automobile
manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as
well as those which they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large
automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of
parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail chains, and with
other parts distributors and retailers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary
association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive replacement parts.
NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose members
in 2004 operated 64 distribution centers located throughout the United States, 58 of which were
owned and operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used
by its members. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes are certain lines
designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not required to
purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines
from other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered trademark NAPA® as part of
the trade name of their distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s
national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and
to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA itself, to a consent
decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
decree enjoins certain
practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among several NAPA
members, fixing of prices or

-4-


terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to
adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location
of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies
throughout the United States and Canada. This group distributes industrial bearings and power
transmission equipment replacement parts, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material
handling components, related supplies and repair services. The Industrial Parts Group continues to
enhance communication and process activities through three distinct programs. These programs
include: MotionMRO.com, an internet-based procurement system; MiSupplierConnect, a manufacturer
communication and fulfillment system; and inMotion, an internal employee communication source and
operational reporting system.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States through Motion Industries, Inc.
(“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion
Canada”), an operating group in the Company’s North American structure.

As of December 31, 2004, the Industrial Parts Group served more than 150,000 customers in all
types of industries located throughout the United States and Canada including automotive, chemical,
food and beverage, wood and lumber, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and pharmaceutical
manufacturers.

Distribution System

. In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operates 418 branches,
nine distribution centers and 34 service centers. The distribution centers stock and distribute
more than 200,000 different items purchased from more than 250 different suppliers. The service
centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 33% of 2004
total industrial purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the
Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 48 states and nine provinces in Canada. Each branch
has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the lines of
products used by customers in the respective market area served.

Motion Canada operates two distribution centers for the 44 Canadian branches serving
industrial and agricultural markets.

Products

. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to its
customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants, machinery and equipment.
Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears,
sprockets, speed reducers and electric motors. The nature of this group’s business demands the
maintenance of large inventories and the ability to provide prompt and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer. Most orders
are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of
receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account.

Supply Agreements

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the
Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the
experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements
as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. The Company has
return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory
obsolescence.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2004, sales from the Company’s Industrial
Parts Group remained constant at approximately 27% of the Company’s net sales, the same as in 2003
and 2002.

Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in
the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services.
To a lesser extent, the Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company cautions that its
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no duty to
update its forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company’s beliefs, expectations and plans
as of the present. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated as a result
of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in general
economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for the Company’s products and services, the
ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships, competitive product and
pricing pressures, including internet related initiatives, the effectiveness of the Company’s
promotional, marketing and advertising programs, changes in laws and regulations, including changes
in accounting and taxation guidance, the uncertainties of litigation, as well as other risks and
uncertainties discussed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Some of these
factors that may affect us are described in greater detail in “Risk Factors” below. Readers are
cautioned that other factors not listed here or in our SEC filings could materially impact the
Company’s future earnings, financial position and cash flows. You should not place undue reliance
upon forward-looking statements contained herein and should carefully read other reports that the
Company will, from time to time, file with the SEC.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to Our Company

We Depend on Our Relationships with Our Vendors.

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, office products and
electrical/electronic materials, our business is dependent on developing and maintaining close and
productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at
favorable prices. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example,
financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of
the products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers
from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these
products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product
suppliers could
disrupt our relationship with some vendors. A disruption of our vendor relationships or a

-8-


disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

Our Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impacted by Certain Laws.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
operation of our business, such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment
matters. Because such laws and regulations are subject to change without notice, we cannot
anticipate the potential costs of compliance. On the other hand, if we fail to comply with
existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or
sanctions. There can be no assurance that the cost of compliance, or a material failure by us to
comply, with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us in the
future.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.

The industries in which we do business are highly competitive. The sale of automotive and
industrial parts, office products and electronic materials is highly competitive in many areas,
including name recognition, product availability, customer service, anticipating changing customer
preferences, store location and price. Increased competition among distributors of automotive and
industrial parts, office products and electronic materials could cause a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to
a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains,
independently owned automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply
manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell
automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If we are unable
to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more
effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

Our Business May Be Materially Affected If Demand For Our Products Slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these
products depends on many factors. With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:
the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for
maintenance and repair; the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles; the number of
vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are no longer under
the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer
vehicles; restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original
vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation; and the economy generally.

Our Business May Be Impacted by General Economic Conditions and Local, National and Global Events.

Our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions,
conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control, including: job growth and
unemployment conditions, industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures, reduction in
manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of
manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, weather, terrorist acts, pricing pressures of our
competitors and customers, shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems, labor
strikes, work stoppages, or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in
the major markets where we operate, changes in interest rates, inflation or currency exchange
rates, changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and
practices.

automotive parts stores in which the Company has an ownership interest were operated in leased
facilities. In addition, NAPA Canada/UAP operated 14 distribution centers and approximately 219
automotive parts and TRACTION stores in Canada, and Auto Todo operates 9 distribution centers and
12 stores in Mexico. The Company’s Automotive Parts Group also operates four Balkamp distribution
centers, five Rayloc rebuilding plants, one transfer and shipping facility and twelve Johnson
Industries distribution centers.

The Company’s Industrial Parts Group, operating through Motion and Motion Canada, operates 9
distribution centers, 34 service centers and 418 branches. Approximately 90% of these branches are
operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Office Products Group operates 40 facilities in the United States and 4
facilities in Canada distributed among the Group’s four geographic divisions. Approximately 75% of
these facilities are operated in leased buildings.

The Company’s Electrical/Electronic Materials Group operates in 31 locations in the United
States and 3 cities in Mexico. All of this Group’s 34 facilities are operated in leased buildings
except one facility, which is owned.

ITEM 3

.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental proceedings, many involving routine
litigation incidental to the businesses, including approximately 1,200 product liability lawsuits
resulting from its national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve
claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by the
Company. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes
that its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will continue
to occur within the ordinary course of the Company’s business and that resolution of these claims
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or consolidated business and
financial condition.
