AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive
replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is the largest member, with approximately 95%
ownership, of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association
formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In addition to over 375,000
available part numbers, the Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory,
cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket.

During 2007, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned and
operated in the United States by the Company; NAPA and TRACTION automotive parts distribution
centers and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and operated by the Company and
NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts
stores and distribution centers in the United States operated by corporations in which the Company
owned either a minority or majority interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations
in which UAP owns a 50% interest; distribution centers in the United States owned by Balkamp, Inc.
(“Balkamp”), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company; rebuilding plants in the United States
owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; and automotive parts distribution centers
and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto
Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company sold the stock of Johnson Industries, including
certain operations owned and operated by Johnson Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective
February 1, 2008, the Company operates one distribution center under the name JI Chicago, LLC.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of
Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair information company with over 40,000
North American subscribers linked to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product,
“Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

In 2007, the Company was a participant in a joint venture with Altrom Group, an import
automotive parts distributor headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. At December 31,
2007, the Company had a 45% interest in Altrom Canada Corp., with 15 Canadian locations. The
Company’s interest in Altrom America Corp., with two locations in the United States, was 90%.
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company increased its ownership interest in Altrom Canada Corp. and
Altrom America Corp. to 100%.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other
than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United
States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and
farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for
such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive
aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers,
leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and
individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s
domestic automotive operations purchase from more than 90 different suppliers, approximately 53% of
2007 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company
has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2007, the Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts
distribution centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO
PARTS stores located in 43 states. At December 31, 2007, Genuine Parts Company owned either a
minority or majority interest in three corporations, which operated approximately 22 auto parts
stores in three states, and a subsidiary corporation operating three distribution centers in three
states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution and marketing of
replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs approximately
3,900 people. The Company operates a network of 12 distribution centers supplying approximately
582 NAPA stores and 94 TRACTION wholesalers. TRACTION is a supplier of parts to small and large
fleet owners and operators and, together with NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining
and forestry industries. These include approximately 211 company owned stores, 19 joint venture or
progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 446 independently
owned stores. NAPA and TRACTION operations supply bannered installers and independent installers
in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service station and repair shops operating under
the banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the NAPA

®

name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates eight distribution centers, four auto parts stores and
four tire centers. Auto Todo is a licensee of the NAPA

®

name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,700 independently owned NAPA
AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served in the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS
stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively,
these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 24% of the Company’s total
sales with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common
ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total sales of the Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 375,000 different parts and related
supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility.
Significant inventories are carried to

provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same
day as received. The majority of sales are on terms that require payment within 30 days of the
statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority
of products are distributed under the NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. Balkamp distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory
items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition,
Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges,
cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions.
Balkamp packages many of the 43,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that
are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are categorized into over 220 different
product groups purchased from approximately 600 domestic suppliers and 100 foreign manufacturers.
In addition, Balkamp operates two Redistribution Centers that provide NAPA with over 1,000 SKUs of
oils, chemicals and procurement items. BALKAMP

®

, a federally registered trademark, is important to
the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has four distribution
centers located in Indianapolis and Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi and West Jordan,
Utah.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates four facilities where certain small
automotive parts are rebuilt or distributed to the members of NAPA under the NAPA

®

brand name.
Rayloc

®

is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with one location in
Atlanta, Georgia, and Traction Heavy Duty parts stores, with seven locations in the United States.
This group distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small fleet owners
and operators.

Segment Data

. In the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, sales from the Automotive
Parts Group were approximately 49% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 51% in 2005.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and the range of
services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its
automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS
catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company
offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on
topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and
retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising
manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS

®

(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for
the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an inventory classification
system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics,
technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises
an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its
NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its
classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes with automobile
manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as
well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive
parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts
manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail chains, and with other
parts distributors and retailers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary
association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive replacement parts.
NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose members
in 2007 operated 64

distribution centers located throughout the United States, 58 of which were owned and operated by
the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members. It is
not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes are certain lines
designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not required to
purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines
from other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered trademark NAPA

®

as part of
the trade name of their distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s
national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and
to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA itself, to a consent
decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive
agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and
agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number
and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies
throughout the United States and Canada. This group distributes bearings, mechanical power
transmission, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components, industrial products
and material handling products. The Industrial Parts Group continues to enhance communication and
process activities through three distinct programs. These programs include: motionindustries.com,
an internet-based procurement system; MiSupplierConnect, a manufacturer communication and
fulfillment system; and inMotion, an internal employee communication source and operational
reporting system.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States through Motion Industries, Inc.
(“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion
Canada”), an operating group in the Company’s North American structure.

During 2007, the Company acquired Jonesboro Bearing & Supply, with two locations; Canco Hose
and Fittings, Inc., with one location; Gerrish Bearing Company, with two locations; Meier
Transmission, with two locations; and Shuster Corporation, with one location. All of the acquired
companies are suppliers of industrial parts and supplies in the United States, with the exception
of Canco, which is located in British Columbia, Canada.

As of December 31, 2007, the Industrial Parts Group served more than 100,000 customers in all
types of industries located throughout the United States and Canada, including the automotive,
food, forest products, primary metal, paper, mining, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries.

Distribution System

. In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operates 470 branches, 10
distribution centers and 35 service centers as of December 31, 2007. The distribution centers stock
and distribute more than 80,000 different items purchased from more than 250 different suppliers.
The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately
40% of 2007 total industrial product purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are
generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 47 states, Puerto Rico and nine
provinces in Canada. Each branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of
inventory representative of the lines of products used by customers in the respective market area
served.

Motion Canada operates two distribution centers for the 48 Canadian branches serving
industrial and agricultural markets.

Products

. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to its
customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants, machinery and equipment.
Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears,
sprockets, speed reducers and electric motors. The nature of this group’s business demands the
maintenance of large inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements.
Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer. Most orders are filled
immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of
order. The majority of all sales are on open account.

Supply Agreements

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the
Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the
experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements
as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. The Company has
return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory
obsolescence.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2007, sales from the Company’s Industrial Parts
Group approximated 31% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 30% in 2006 and 29% in 2005.

Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the
distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a
lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the
customer.

RISK FACTORS.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we file with the SEC or otherwise
release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute
forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts,
investors, the media and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate,
for example, to our future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition, economic
performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and
services. The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of
currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated as
a result of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those set
forth below and in other documents that we file with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no
duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however,
to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, Form 8-K and other
reports to the SEC.

Risks Relating to Our Company

We Depend on Our Relationships with Our Vendors.

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, office products and
electrical/electronic materials, our business depends on developing and maintaining close and
productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at
favorable prices. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example,
financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of
the products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers
from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these
products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product
suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors. A disruption of our vendor
relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

Our Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impacted by Certain Laws.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
operation of our business, such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment
matters, as well as changes in accounting and taxation guidance. Because such laws and regulations
are subject to change without notice, we cannot anticipate the potential costs of compliance. On
the other hand, if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject
to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. There can be no assurance that the cost of
compliance, or a material failure by us to comply, with these laws and regulations will not have a
material adverse effect on us in the future.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

Our Business May Be Impacted by General Economic Conditions and Local, National and Global Events.

Our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions,
conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control, including: job growth and
unemployment conditions, industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures, reduction in
manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of
manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, weather, terrorist acts, pricing pressures of our
competitors and customers, shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems, labor
strikes, work stoppages, or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in
the major markets where we operate, changes in interest rates, inflation or currency exchange
rates, changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and
practices.

Our Business May Be Materially Affected If Demand for Our Products Slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these
products depends on many factors. With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:
the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for
maintenance and repair; the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles; the number of
vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically no
longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair
than newer vehicles; restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by
the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation; and the economy generally.

We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.

The industries in which we do business are highly competitive. The sale of automotive and
industrial parts, office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by
many factors including name recognition, product availability, customer service, anticipating
changing customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures. Increased competition among
distributors of automotive and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials,
including internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to
a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains,
independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers
that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs
that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If we
are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, including internet related
initiatives, or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and
our sales and profits may decline.

PROPERTIES

.

The Company’s headquarters and Automotive Parts Group headquarters are located in two adjacent
office buildings owned by the Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

United States distributed among eight geographic divisions. Approximately 90% of the distribution
center properties are owned by the Company. At December 31, 2007, the Company operated
approximately 1,100 NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 43 states, and the Company owned either a
minority or majority interest in approximately 22 additional auto parts stores and three
distribution centers located in six states. Other than NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located within
Company owned distribution centers, the majority of the automotive parts stores in which the
Company has an ownership interest were operated in leased facilities. In addition, NAPA Canada/UAP
operates 12 distribution centers and approximately 230 automotive parts and TRACTION stores in
Canada, and Auto Todo operates eight distribution centers and eight stores and tire centers in
Mexico. These operations were operated in leased facilities.

The Company’s Automotive Parts Group also operates four Balkamp distribution centers, four
Rayloc rebuilding and distribution facilities and one transfer and shipping facility. Finally,
Altrom America operates two import parts distribution centers and the Heavy Vehicle Parts Group
operates one TW distribution center and seven Traction stores. These operations were operated
in leased facilities.

these facilities are operated in leased buildings.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental proceedings, many involving routine
litigation incidental to the businesses, including approximately 1,300 product liability lawsuits
resulting from its national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve
claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by the
Company. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes
that its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will continue
to occur within the ordinary course of the Company’s business and that resolution of these claims
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition.
