AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive
replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is the largest member, with approximately 95%
ownership, of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association
formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. In addition to over 320,000
available part numbers, the Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete inventory,
cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket.

During 2006, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned in the
United States by the Company; NAPA and TRACTION automotive parts distribution centers and auto
parts stores in Canada owned and operated by NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores in the United States operated by
corporations in which the Company owned either a minority or majority interest; auto parts stores
in Canada operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50% interest; distribution centers in the
United States owned by Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company;
rebuilding plants in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division;
distribution centers of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive supplies owned and operated in the
United States by Johnson Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary; and automotive parts distribution
centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V.
(“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of
Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading diagnostic and repair information company with over 40,000
North

-2-


American subscribers linked to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product,
“Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive
aftermarket.

The Company participates in a joint venture with Altrom Group, an import automotive parts
distributor headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2006, the Company
increased its interest in Altrom Canada Corp., with 14 Canadian locations, from 25% to 45%. The
Company’s interest in Altrom America Corp., with one location in the United States, was increased
from 49% to 90%, also in November 2006.

The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other
than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United
States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and
farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for
such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive
aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers,
leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and
individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s
domestic automotive operations purchase from more than 90 different suppliers, approximately 53% of
2006 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company
has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from
inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System

. In 2006, the Company operated 58 domestic NAPA automotive parts
distribution centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO
PARTS stores located in 43 states. At December 31, 2006, Genuine Parts Company owned either a
minority or majority interest in three corporations, which operated approximately 21 auto parts
stores in three states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a Canadian leader in the distribution, marketing and
rebuilding of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs
approximately 3,900 people. The Company operates a network of 13 distribution centers supplying
approximately 584 NAPA stores and 83 TRACTION wholesalers. TRACTION is a supplier of parts to small
fleet owners and operators and, together with NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining
and forestry industries. These include approximately 201 company owned stores, 22 joint venture or
progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 444 independently
owned stores. NAPA and TRACTION operations supply bannered installers and independent installers
in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service station and repair shops operating under
the banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the NAPA® name in Canada.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates eight distribution centers, seven auto parts stores and
five tire centers. Auto Todo is a licensee of the NAPA® name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA
AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the market areas served in the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS
stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively,
these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 25% of the Company’s total
sales with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common
ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total sales of the Company.

Products

. Distribution centers have access to over 320,000 different parts and related
supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility.
Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most
orders are filled and shipped the same day as received. The majority of sales are on terms that
require payment within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of the
products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA® name, a mark
licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Related Operations

. Balkamp distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory
items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition,
Balkamp distributes

-3-


service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges,
cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions.
Balkamp packages many of the 30,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that
are distributed to the members of NAPA. These products are categorized into over 160 different
product groups purchased from approximately 500 domestic suppliers and 130 foreign manufacturers.
In addition, Balkamp operates two Redistribution Centers that provide NAPA with over 300 SKUs of
oils and chemicals. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and
marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization. Balkamp has four distribution centers located in
Indianapolis and Plainfield, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi and West Jordan, Utah.

Johnson Industries, Inc. (“Johnson”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is an
independent distributor of ACDelco, Motorcraft and other automotive supplies. Johnson, founded in
1924, sells primarily to large fleets and new car dealers from a network of four distribution
centers located in Atlanta, Georgia, Nashville, Tennessee, Chicago, Illinois and Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates four plants where certain small
automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are distributed to the members of NAPA under the
NAPA® brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2006, sales from the Automotive Parts Group
were approximately 49% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 51% in 2005 and 52% in 2004.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

. The Company believes that the quality and the range of
services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its
automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery,
obsolescence protection, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS
catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows
independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company
offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on
topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and
retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising
manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS®
(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for
the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.

In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an inventory classification
system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for
automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics,
technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises
an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its
NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 10 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence
have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its
classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition

. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes with automobile
manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as
well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive
parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts
manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail chains, and with other
parts distributors and retailers.

NAPA

. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary
association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive replacement parts.
NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose members
in 2006 operated 64 distribution centers located throughout the United States, 58 of which were
owned and operated by the
Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members. It is not
involved in the chain of distribution.

-4-


Among the automotive lines that each NAPA member purchases and distributes are certain lines
designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The members are not required to
purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines
from other supply sources.

The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered trademark NAPA® as part of
the trade name of their distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s
national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and
to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA itself, to a consent
decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent
decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive
agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and
agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number
and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies
throughout the United States and Canada. This group distributes industrial bearings and power
transmission equipment replacement parts, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material
handling components, related supplies and repair services. The Industrial Parts Group continues to
enhance communication and process activities through three distinct programs. These programs
include: motionindustries.com, an internet-based procurement system; MiSupplierConnect, a
manufacturer communication and fulfillment system; and inMotion, an internal employee communication
source and operational reporting system.

The Company distributes industrial parts in the United States through Motion Industries, Inc.
(“Motion”), headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion
Canada”), an operating group in the Company’s North American structure.

During 2006, the Company acquired Lewis Supply Company, with 12 locations, and Ruston
Industrial, with six locations. Both of the acquired companies are suppliers of industrial parts
and supplies in the south central United States.

As of December 31, 2006, the Industrial Parts Group served more than 116,000 customers in all
types of industries located throughout the United States and Canada including automotive, chemical,
food and beverage, wood and lumber, iron and steel, pulp and paper, mining and aggregate and
pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Distribution System

. In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operates 464 branches,
nine distribution centers and 36 service centers as of December 31, 2006. The distribution centers
stock and distribute more than 80,000 different items purchased from more than 250 different
suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers.
Approximately 40% of 2006 total industrial purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are
generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 46 states, Puerto Rico and nine
provinces in Canada. Each branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of
inventory representative of the lines of products used by customers in the respective market area
served.

Motion Canada operates two distribution centers for the 48 Canadian branches serving
industrial and agricultural markets.

Products

. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to its
customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants, machinery and equipment.
Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears,
sprockets, speed reducers and electric motors. The nature of this group’s business demands the
maintenance of large inventories and the ability to provide prompt

-5-


and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer. Most orders
are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of
receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account.

Supply Agreements

. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the
Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the
experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements
as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. The Company has
return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory
obsolescence.

Segment Data

. In the year ended December 31, 2006, sales from the Company’s Industrial
Parts Group approximated 30% of the Company’s net sales as compared to 29% in 2005 and 27% in 2004.

Competition

. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in
the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services.
To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to
the customer.

OFFICE PRODUCTS GROUP

The Office Products Group, operated through S. P. Richards Company (“S. P. Richards”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. S. P. Richards is
engaged in the wholesale distribution of a broad line of office and other business related products
that are used in the daily operation of businesses, schools, offices and institutions. Office

Calgary and Winnipeg.

Distribution System

. The Office Products Group distributes more than 40,000 items to over
7,000 business product resellers throughout the United States and Canada from a network of 42

overnight delivery of the Company’s comprehensive product offering. Approximately 54% of the
Company’s 2006 total office products purchases were made from 10 major suppliers.

The Office Products Group sells strictly to resellers of office products. These resellers
include independently owned office product dealers, national office product superstores and mass

of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

-6-


While the Company’s inventory includes products from over 350 of the industry’s leading
manufacturers worldwide, S. P. Richards also markets seven proprietary brands of items. These

Products Group remained constant at approximately 17% of the Company’s net sales, the same as in
2005 and 2004.

Competition

competes with many other wholesale distributors as well as with certain manufacturers of office
products.

.

The Electrical/Electronic Materials Group’s integrated supply programs
are a part of the marketing strategy, as a greater number of customers—especially national
accounts—are given the opportunity to participate in this low-cost, high-service capability. The
Group developed AIMS (Advanced Inventory Management System), a totally integrated, highly automated
solution for inventory management. The Group’s Integrated Supply offering also includes SupplyPro,

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we file with the SEC or otherwise
release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute
forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts,
investors, the media and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate,
for example to our future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition, economic
performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and
services. The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of
currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated as
a result of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those set
forth below and in other documents that we file with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no
duty to update its forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to review any further
disclosures we make on related subjects in our Forms 10-Q and Form 8-K reports to the SEC.

Risks Relating to Our Company

We Depend on Our Relationships with Our Vendors.

As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, office products and
electrical/electronic materials, our business is dependent on developing and maintaining close and
productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at
favorable prices. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example,
financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of
the products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers
from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these
products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product
suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors. A disruption of our vendor
relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

Our Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impacted by Certain Laws.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
operation of our business, such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment
matters, as well as changes in accounting and taxation guidance. Because such laws and regulations
are subject to change without notice, we cannot anticipate the potential costs of compliance. On
the other hand, if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject
to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. There can be no assurance that the cost of
compliance, or a material failure by us to comply, with these laws and regulations will not have a
material adverse effect on us in the future.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

Our Business May Be Impacted by General Economic Conditions and Local, National and Global Events.

Our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions,
conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control, including: job growth and
unemployment conditions,
industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures, reduction in manufacturing capacity in our
targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to
foreign countries, weather, terrorist acts, pricing pressures of our competitors and customers,
shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems, labor strikes, work stoppages, or
other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in the major markets where we
operate, changes in interest rates, inflation or currency exchange rates, changes in accounting
policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and practices.

-8-


Our Business May Be Materially Affected If Demand for Our Products Slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these
products depends on many factors. With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:
the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for
maintenance and repair; the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles; the number of
vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically no
longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair
than newer vehicles; restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by
the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation; and the economy generally.

We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.

The industries in which we do business are highly competitive. The sale of automotive and
industrial parts, office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by
many factors including name recognition, product availability, customer service, anticipating
changing customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures. Increased competition among
distributors of automotive and industrial parts, office products and electronic materials,
including internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to
a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains,
independently owned automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply
manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell
automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If we are unable
to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more
effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

.

The Company is subject to various legal and governmental proceedings, many involving routine
litigation incidental to the businesses, including approximately 1,800 product liability lawsuits
resulting from its national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve
claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by the
Company. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes
that its defense and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will continue
to occur within the ordinary course of the Company’s business and that resolution of these claims
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or consolidated business and
financial condition.

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2003 represents a non-cash
charge related to cash consideration received from vendors in conjunction with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s EITF 02-16. Had the Company
accounted for vendor consideration in
accordance with EITF 02-16 in prior years, there would have been no significant impact on net
income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share for the year ended December 31, 2002.
In addition, in accordance with EITF 02-16, approximately $102 million was reclassified from
selling, administrative and other expenses to cost of goods sold for the year ended December
31, 2003. Had the Company accounted for consideration received from vendors in accordance
with EITF 02-16 in prior years, approximately $90 million would have been reclassified from
selling, administrative and other expenses to cost of goods sold for the year ended December
31, 2002.

ITEM 7

.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in “Item 1.A Risk Factors”
and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and related notes beginning on page F-1 of this report. Historical results are not
necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period.

Overview

Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive
replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic
materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded
in Atlanta, Georgia. We have increased sales in 56 of the last 57 years and increased profits in 44
of the last 46 years. In 2006, business was conducted throughout the United States, in Puerto Rico,
in Canada and in Mexico from approximately 2,000 locations.

We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an
increase of 7% compared to $9.8 billion in 2005. Consolidated net income for the year ended
December 31, 2006, was $475 million, up 9% from $437 million in 2005. The combination of ongoing
healthy economic conditions, strong end markets and effective internal initiatives provided us the
opportunity to achieve another record level of sales and earnings in 2006. All four business
segments contributed to our progress for the year, with each showing gains in revenues and profits.

Our progress in 2006 follows 8% increases in revenues in both
2004 and 2005, and represents the third consecutive year of
double-digit growth in earnings per share. During the three-year
period ended December 31, 2006, the Company implemented
a variety of growth initiatives, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines,
geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and cost savings
initiatives. Each of our business segments participated in developing these initiatives, as
discussed further below.

The major categories on the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet were relatively consistent
with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet categories, subject to certain exceptions
explained below. Our cash balances decreased $53 million or 28%
from December 31, 2005, due primarily to cash used during the
year for increased working capital requirements and investments
in capital expenditures. Accounts receivable grew $41 million or
3%, which is less than our increase in revenues, and inventory
was up less than 1%. Accounts payable decreased $63 million
or 7% from the prior year, due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain
suppliers during 2006, resulting in the decrease in days payables outstanding. Total debt
outstanding at December 31, 2006 was unchanged from December 31, 2005.

Results of Operations

Our results of operations are summarized for the three years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, as follows:

Net Sales

Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $10.5 billion, another record
sales level for the Company and a 7% increase from 2005. Again in 2006, each of our four business
segments showed progress in revenues and contributed to our overall sales growth. We attribute this
improvement to the ongoing good health of the national economy, strong end markets and effective
growth initiatives. For the year, prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment, 3% in
the Industrial and Office segments and 7% in the Electrical segment.

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $9.8 billion, an 8% increase from 2004.
Similar to 2006, all of the business segments contributed to our sales growth in 2005, as our
internal initiatives, healthy economy and positive trends in the industries we serve enhanced the
sales volume in each of our four groups. Prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment,
3% in the Office and Electrical segments and 6% in the Industrial segment in 2005.

Automotive Group

Net sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) increased by 3% to $5.2 billion in 2006. After
achieving sales increases of 5% in both the first and second quarters, our sales growth slowed to
1% growth in the third quarter, followed by a 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Automotives’ sales
initiatives, including the addition of 64 net new NAPA AUTO PARTS stores and the continued
expansion of NAPA AutoCare programs, were somewhat impacted by the effect of higher gasoline prices
on vehicle miles driven and aftermarket product demand. Both of these factors influenced our sales
trends for the year. Additionally, our core NAPA sales increase of 5% was offset by the sales
decrease at Johnson Industries, which was downsized in 2005.

-13-


Automotive sales were $5.0 billion in 2005, an increase of 6% over 2004. Among the quarters in
2005, sales increases over the same period of the prior year ranged from an increase of 4% in the
first quarter to 8% in the third quarter, our strongest period for the year. The continued
effectiveness of our growth initiatives in this group, as well as positive industry trends, helped
produce these results. As in 2006, stronger growth in our core NAPA operations was offset by a
decrease in sales at Johnson Industries, where we sold eight of twelve operations during 2005.

Industrial
Group

Net sales
for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (“Industrial”), were $3.1 billion in 2006, an
increase of 11% compared to 2005, and our third consecutive year of 11% sales growth. In 2006, this
group recorded steady progress throughout the year, with double-digit growth in each quarter.
Industrial expanded its distribution network during the year by opening 10 new locations and by
adding another 31 locations via two acquisitions. U.S. industrial production and capacity
utilization indices also showed continued strength for the manufacturing sector in 2006, and based
on current indices, the outlook remains positive for this sector in 2007.

Net sales in 2005 were $2.8 billion, an 11% increase compared to 2004. In 2005, this group had
double-digit growth in each quarter except in the fourth quarter when sales increased 9%. Over the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006, Industrial has benefited from a combination of price
increases common in the industry as well as stronger sales volume.

Office Group

Net sales
for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group (“Office”), were $1.8 billion, an increase
of 7% compared to the prior year. Among our business groups, Office is our most steady performer
from year to year, and in 2006, product and customer expansion efforts and the continued
development of effective marketing programs and dealer services helped to drive this group’s
progress. Although its rate of sales growth decreased during the year, we were encouraged by the
Office group’s performance in 2006. Sales increased by 13% in the first quarter, 6% in the second
quarter, 5% in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth quarter.

Net sales in 2005 were $1.7 billion, up 8% over 2004. This represents a solid increase for the
Office group and reflects the success of its ongoing business expansion strategy. Among the
quarters, revenues grew stronger over the year, with sales increasing 6% in


the first quarter, 8% in the second and third quarters and 10% in the fourth quarter.

Electrical
Group

Net sales
for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (“Electrical”), increased by 20% to $408
million in 2006. The strong performance at Electrical reflects the continued manufacturing
expansion in the U.S., as well as this group’s commitment to ongoing sales initiatives. In 2006,
Electrical completed phase one of a sales process restructuring program developed to improve
customer contact and maximize customer growth. For the year, sales were up 13% in the first
quarter, 24% in the second quarter, 23% in the third quarter and 17% in the fourth quarter.

Net sales were up 2% to $342 million in 2005. Electrical’s strongest performance was in the fourth
quarter, after generally flat results over the first three quarters of the year. EIS sold its
Circuit Supply division in April of 2005, which impacted its overall growth rate. The ongoing
Electrical operations were up 9% for the year, reflecting the continued strength in the
manufacturing sector, which began to show improvement late in 2003.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing
68.7% of net sales in both years. After improving gross margins in each of the previous two years,
our ongoing gross margin growth initiatives were offset in 2006 by increasing competitive pricing
pressures in the markets we serve. Our initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and
sell higher margin products, and minimize material acquisition costs lessened the effect of these
negative margin pressures in 2006.

Cost of goods sold in 2005 was $6.7 billion or 68.7% of net sales compared to $6.3 billion or 68.9%
in 2004. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales reflects the success of our
initiatives implemented to improve gross margins. These initiatives were initially developed to
offset the usual competitive pricing pressures as well as lower levels of vendor discounts and
volume incentives earned over the prior few years, especially in Industrial. Each of our business
segments also experienced vendor price increases in 2005, and by working with our customers we were
able to pass some of these along to them, particularly in Industrial.

-14-


Operating Expenses

Selling,
administrative and other expenses (“SG&A”) increased to $2.4 billion in 2006, representing
22.8% of sales and down slightly from 22.9% of sales in 2005. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net
sales reflect the benefits of our cost control initiatives. Our cost management initiatives
continue to emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of
people and systems. We were pleased with the success of our initiatives and expect our SG&A
expenses as a percentage of sales to show progress in the foreseeable future. Depreciation and
amortization expense in 2006 was $73 million, up 12% from 2005, which relates to the increase in
capital expenditures in the current year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in
2006, consistent with our bad debt expense in 2005.

In 2005, SG&A increased to $2.2 billion, or 22.9% of net sales, a slight increase from 22.8% of
sales in 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2005 was $66 million, up 5% from 2004, and
corresponds to the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 relative to the prior year. The
provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in 2005, down from $21 million in the prior year.
This was due to our improved collections on accounts receivable balances relative to 2004, when the
Company incurred unusually high bad debt losses.

Non-Operating Expenses

Non-operating expenses for the Company consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $32
million, $34 million and $39 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in interest
expense in 2006 is primarily due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement.

In 2005, the decrease in interest expense from the prior year relates to the repayment of
borrowings during 2004 to its current level.

In “Other”, interest income net of minority interests increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to the
change in interest income earned on the Company’s cash balances.

Operating Profit

Operating profit was $846 million in 2006, an increase of 7.4% from $788 million in 2005. Operating
profit as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, was 8.1% in 2006,
reflecting no change from our operating margin achieved in 2005 and 2004. Our constant operating
margin over the last three years is primarily the result of specific short-term margin issues in
Automotive, which offset the benefits of our overall improvement in
gross margin and SG&A expense
as a percentage of net sales over these periods. We discuss these issues further below. We remain
optimistic that our margins will show improvement in the year ahead.

Automotive
Group

Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.7% in 2006 from 7.9% in 2005. During 2006, the Company
recorded non-recurring costs associated with certain closing and consolidation expenses at Johnson
Industries and our re-manufacturing operations. At Johnson Industries, we sold or closed eight of
twelve locations during 2005, resulting in selling and closure costs in that year, and we incurred
additional costs to downsize these operations in 2006. At our re-manufacturing operations, we
incurred costs during the year related to certain facility consolidations.

Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.9% in 2005 from 8.4% in 2004. Despite showing progress
in our core NAPA operations, Automotive was challenged with specific issues at Johnson Industries,
as discussed above, and, within the re-manufacturing operations, we made some price adjustments to
certain product lines to drive sales growth, resulting in lower margins for this group relative to
the prior year. We consider the issues reviewed for 2005 and 2006 to be short-term challenges for
this group and believe our Automotive operating margins will show improvement in the year ahead.

Industrial Group

Industrial operating margins increased to 8.3% in 2006 from 7.7% in 2005. This represents the third
consecutive year of margin improvement for Industrial and reflects the effectiveness of our sales
and operating initiatives, as well as the relative strength of the industries served by Industrial
over these periods. Industrial operating margins increased to 7.7% in 2005 from 6.9% in 2004. This
was the largest margin gain among our business segments in 2005 and reflects the strong performance
at Industrial for the year.

Office Group

Operating margins in Office were 9.4% in 2006, down slightly from 9.5% in 2005. Office
continues to generate industry leading operating margins despite competitive pricing pressures in
the industry. These pressures are offset by ongoing product and customer expansion efforts and the
continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services. Office operating margins
were 9.5% in 2005, down from 9.8% in 2004. The success of this Group’s sales initiatives was offset
by pricing pressures, which resulted in the decrease in operating margin in 2005.

Electrical Group

Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.5% in 2006 from 5.1% in 2005. This represents the
third consecutive year of margin improvement for Electrical and reflects the continued strength in
the manufacturing sector of the economy, combined with Electrical’s successful growth strategy
during this three year period. Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.1% in 2005 from 4.4%
in 2004. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress we see in Electrical.

The effective income tax rate was 38.3% in 2006, unchanged from the effective rate in 2005. The
effective income tax rate increased to 38.3% in 2005 from 37.8% in 2004. The increase in 2005 was
primarily due to higher state income taxes in that year and favorable non-recurring items in the
prior year.

Net Income

Net income was $475 million in 2006, an increase of 9% from $437 million in 2005. On a per share
diluted basis, net income was $2.76 in 2006 compared to $2.50 in 2005, up 10%. 2006 represents
our third consecutive year of double-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Net income in
2006 and 2005 was 4.5% of net sales.

Net income was $437 million in 2005, up 11% from $396 million in 2004, and on a per share diluted
basis, net income was $2.50 in 2005 compared to $2.25 in 2004. Net income in 2005 was 4.5% of net
sales compared to 4.3% in 2004.

Share-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123(R) choosing the “modified prospective” method. Compensation cost recognized for the year
ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated.
Most options may be exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later than ten years from the date
of grant. As of January 1, 2006, there was approximately $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation
cost for all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 to employees that remained unvested prior to
the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R). This compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately four years. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total
compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately $20.2 million.
The weighted-average period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is
approximately three years. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, $11.9 million,
$6.9 million and $2.5 million of share-based compensation cost was recorded, respectively. There
have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods subsequent to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R).

Financial Condition

The major consolidated balance sheet categories at December 31, 2006, with the exception of
the accounts discussed below, were relatively consistent with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet
categories. The Company’s cash balances decreased $53 million or 28% from December 31, 2005, due
primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments
in capital expenditures. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 increased 3% compared
to the prior year, which is less than our increase in revenues for the fourth quarter and year.
Inventory at December 31, 2006, was up less than 1% from December 31, 2005, reflecting our
continued emphasis on inventory management. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $20
million or 10% from December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in receivables due from vendors.
Accounts payable at December 31, 2006 decreased $63 million or 7% from the prior year, due
primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006 and the resulting
decrease in days payables outstanding.

Other assets at December 31, 2006 decreased $339 million or 67%; other long-term liabilities
increased $73 million or 64%; and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, included as a
component of shareholders’ equity, was a loss of $243 million at December 31, 2006 compared to
income of $46 million at December 31, 2005. These changes in other assets, other long-term
liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss were primarily due to the pension adjustments
required by SFAS No. 158

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.2 to 1 at December 31, 2006 compared to
3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2005. Our cash position remains strong. The Company had $500 million in
total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The Company continues to generate excellent cash flows, with $434 million in net cash provided by
operating activities in 2006. The 9% increase in net income was offset by the use of cash for
working capital requirements during the year, resulting in a slight decrease in cash from
operations compared to 2005. In 2005, the Company generated $441 million in cash from operations, a
decrease from 2004. Despite an increase in net income in 2005, the 2005 operating cash flows were
down from the prior year primarily due to an increase of $70 million in contributions to
Company-sponsored defined benefit plans. In addition, the Company’s extended term negotiations and
other working capital improvements in 2004 were especially favorable for operating cash flows in
that year. The Company believes existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations will
be sufficient to fund its operations, and to meet its cash requirements.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash flow used in investing activities was $146 million in 2006, up from the prior two years due
primarily to increased spending for capital expenditures during the year. In 2006, capital
expenditures were $126 million compared to approximately $86 million and $72 million in 2005 and
2004, respectively. The Company believes that 2006 was an extraordinary year for capital spending
due in part to the timing of certain assets placed in service during the year. The Company expects
its investment in capital expenditures to decrease to more customary levels in the foreseeable
future.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

The Company used $341 million of cash in financing activities in 2006, primarily for dividends to
shareholders and the repurchase of the Company’s common stock. Dividends and share repurchases were
also the primary financing activities in 2005, and in 2004, the primary financing activities were
the dividend and repayment of borrowings. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $228
million, $216 million, and $209 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company
expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2006, 2005
and 2004, the Company repurchased $123 million, $119 million and $21 million, respectively, in
Company stock. We plan to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value
of shares repurchased will vary annually.

While no borrowings were repaid in 2006 or 2005, the Company repaid variable rate borrowings of
approximately $177 million in 2004. Long-term debt of $500 million at December 31, 2006 is
comprised of two $250 million term notes with a consortium of financial and insurance institutions
due in 2008 and 2011. The Company does not anticipate repaying these notes prior to their scheduled
expiration. The increasing dividends and fluctuations in cash used for share repurchases and the
reduction of debt primarily explain the changes in cash used for financing activities in 2006, 2005
and 2004.

Notes and Other Borrowings

The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of
financial institutions, which matures in October 2008 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .25%. (5.57%
at December 31, 2006). At December 31, 2006 and 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the line of
credit.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under a $500 million
financing arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series A, 5.86% fixed, due 2008; and $250 million,
Series B, 6.23% fixed, due 2011. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum
debt-to-equity ratio, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and certain limitations on additional
borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The
weighted average interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 6.05% at
December 31, 2006 and 2005. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was
$26.4 million, $29.6 million and $37.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Construction and Lease Agreement

The
Company also has an $85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third
party. Properties acquired by the lessor are constructed and then leased to the Company under
operating lease agreements. The total amount advanced and outstanding under this agreement at
December 31, 2006 was approximately $84 million. Since the resulting leases are operating leases,
no debt obligation is recorded on the Company’s balance sheet. This construction and lease
agreement expires in 2009 and no additional properties are being added to this agreement, as the
construction term has ended. Lease payments fluctuate based upon current interest rates and are
generally based upon LIBOR plus .50%. The lease agreement contains residual value guarantee
provisions and guarantees under events of default. Although management believes the likelihood of
funding to be remote, the maximum guarantee obligation, which represents our residual value
guarantee, under the construction and lease agreement is approximately $73 million at December 31,
2006. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding
this arrangement.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and
other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We
are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase
orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders
may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution
needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time
horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for
the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum
quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

As discussed in “Construction and Lease Agreement” above,
the Company has approximately $84 million outstanding under
a construction and lease agreement which expires in 2009. In
addition, the Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and
certain other affiliates in which the Company has a minority equity
ownership interest (affiliates). The Company’s maximum exposure
to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and
affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s
guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses
in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’
borrowings. The following table shows the Company’s approximate
commercial commitments under these two arrangements as of
December 31, 2006:

In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension
plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans
from time to time. Contributions in 2006 were $67 million.
We expect to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined
benefit plans in 2007, and contributions required for 2008 and
future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors
including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future
changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement
of the plans’ obligations.

Share Repurchases

On April 19, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on August 21, 2006,
the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million
shares. Such repurchase plans were announced on April 20, 1999
and August 21, 2006, respectively. The authorization for these
repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been
repurchased, or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the
Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2006, approximately 14.7
million shares have been repurchased under these authorizations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

General

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an
accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about
matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and
if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or
changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to
occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial
statements. Management believes the following critical accounting
policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For
further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1
of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories – Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories
and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically,
these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast
majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible
to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor
return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its
inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its
risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories
would increase if such were to occur.

-18-


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – Methodology

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates
an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net
sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate
is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a
specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g.,
bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging
of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer
base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn
in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates
could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the
need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded
provisions for bad debts of $16.5 million, $16.4 million and
$20.7 million, respectively.

Consideration Received from Vendors

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each
year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase
incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company
earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified
volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling
its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs. The
Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives
as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of
inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the
end of the year and, in the case of advertising allowances, upon
completion of the Company’s obligations related thereto. While
management believes the Company will continue to receive such
amounts in 2007 and beyond, there can be no assurance that
vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives
and allowances in the future.

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and
equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential
impairment indicators. The Company’s judgments regarding the
existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions
and operational performance, among other factors. Future events
could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators
exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are
impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires the Company
to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require
judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada
establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor
the performance of the Company’s pension plan assets. The pension
plan investment strategy implemented by the Company’s
management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the
pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation
in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary standards. The long-term
primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a
reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue
exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing
power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the
pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return.

Based on the investment policy for the U.S. pension plan, as well
as an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s
set allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected
rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2007 pension expense
or income is 8.25% for the U.S. plan. The asset study forecasted
expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the
Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and
historical relationships.

The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations
could be effectively settled and is based on capital market
conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the
timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension
obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of
high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount
rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a
discount rate for the U.S. plan of 6.00% at December 31, 2006.

Net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $48.2
million, $32.4 million, and $26.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increasing
trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to
the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets,
the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. These
expenses are included in SG&A expenses. Refer to Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
employee benefit plans.

On September 29, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 158

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

. SFAS No. 158
was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the balance sheet
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2006.
Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
details regarding the incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158.

The Company has evaluated the potential impact of the Pension
Protection Act (“the Act”), which was passed into law on August
17, 2006, on future U.S. pension plan funding requirements based
on current market conditions. The Act is not anticipated to have a
material effect on the level of future funding requirements or on
the Company’s liquidity and capital resources.

Quarterly Results of Operations

The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the
amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in
its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad
debts, inventory adjustments and discounts and volume incentives
earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales,
and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and
projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on
an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the
annual October 31 book-to-physical inventory adjustment. The
methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim
reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination
at year-end. The effect of these adjustments in 2006 and
2005 was not significant.

The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:

Report of Management

Genuine Parts Company

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and related information included herein for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The opinion of Ernst & Young
LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
on those consolidated financial statements is included herein. The
primary responsibility for the integrity of the financial information
included in this annual report rests with management. Such information
was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles appropriate in the circumstances based on our best estimates
and judgments and giving due consideration to materiality.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Genuine Parts Company and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and to the
board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of the Company’s published financial statements. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:

i.

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii.

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and

iii.

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.
In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” Based on this
assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2006,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on our assessment
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the
operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006. This report appears on page F-3.

Audit Committee Responsibility

The Audit Committee of Genuine Parts Company’s Board of Directors
is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s financial
reports and accounting practices to ascertain that they are within
acceptable limits of sound practice in such matters. The membership
of the Committee consists of non-employee Directors. At periodic
meetings, the Audit Committee discusses audit and financial reporting
matters and the internal audit function with representatives of financial
management and with representatives from Ernst & Young LLP.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Genuine Parts Company

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Report of Management, that Genuine Parts Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Genuine Parts Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Genuine Parts Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Genuine Parts Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 of Genuine Parts Company and our report
dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the
Financial Statements and Schedule

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Genuine Parts Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Genuine Parts Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index
at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Genuine Parts Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also, in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, effective December 31, 2006, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness
of Genuine Parts Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2006

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Genuine Parts Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries
(the Company) is a distributor of automotive replacement parts,
industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic
materials. The Company serves a diverse customer base
through more than 2,000 locations in North America and, therefore,
has limited exposure from credit losses to any particular
customer, region, or industry segment. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition
and generally does not require collateral.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of
the Company. Income applicable to minority interests is included in
other non-operating expenses (income). Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from
those estimates and the differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenues from product sales upon
shipment to its customers.

Foreign Currency Translation

The consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into
U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates, respectively.
The foreign currency translation adjustment is included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash
equivalents.

Trade Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company
estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net
sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate
is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a
specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g.,
bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of
accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base
that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in
any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could
result in higher than expected defaults, and, therefore, the need
to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recorded provisions
for bad debts of approximately $16,472,000, $16,356,000 and
$20,697,000, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $13,456,000
and $11,386,000, respectively.

Merchandise Inventories, including Consideration
Received from Vendors

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a
majority of automotive parts, electrical/electronic materials, and
industrial parts, and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for
office products and certain other inventories. If the FIFO method
had been used for all inventories, cost would have been approximately
$316,148,000 and $278,573,000 higher than reported at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories
and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically,
these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the
Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence
and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs.
While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return
privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated
with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if
such were to occur.

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year
with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives
and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company earns
inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances upon
achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The
Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives
and advertising allowances as part of its inventory cost based on
cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory
purchases through the end of the year, or, in the case of specific
advertising allowances, upon completion of the Company’s obligations
related thereto. While management believes the Company will
continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2007 and beyond,
there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide
comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of
prepaid expenses and amounts due from vendors.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess
of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets
acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and

Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”) requires that when the
fair value of goodwill is less than the related carrying value, entities
are required to reduce the amount of goodwill. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company reviews its goodwill
annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. No goodwill
impairments have been recorded in 2006, 2005, or 2004. The
impairment-only approach required by SFAS No. 142 may have
the effect of increasing the volatility of the Company’s earnings
if goodwill impairment occurs at a future date.

F-9


SFAS No. 142 also requires that entities discontinue amortization of
all purchased goodwill, including amortization of goodwill recorded
in past business combinations. Accordingly, the Company no longer
amortizes goodwill.

Other
Assets

Other assets are comprised of the following:

$

$

The reduction in other assets is primarily due to adjustments to
retirement benefit assets as required by SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans

(“SFAS No. 158”), which is discussed further in Note 7.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Buildings include
certain leases capitalized at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Depreciation
and amortization is primarily determined on a straight-line
basis over the following estimated useful life of each asset: buildings
and improvements, 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment,
5 to 15 years.

Long-Lived
Assets Other Than Goodwill

The Company assesses its long-lived assets other than goodwill for
impairment annually or whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze
recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future cash
flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these projected cash
flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be
recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets with a corresponding
charge to earnings. Impairment losses, if any, are measured based
upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value
of the assets.

Other
Long-Term Liabilities

Other long-term liabilities is comprised of the following:

(in thousands) December 31,



Retirement and post-employment
benefit liabilities

36,145

Other

19,329

2,402

Total other long-term liabilities

$

187,509

$

114,623

The increase in other long-term liabilities is primarily due to
adjustments to retirement and post-employment benefit liabilities
required by SFAS No. 158, which is discussed further in Note 7.

The Company’s retirement and post-employment benefit liabilities
consist primarily of actuarially determined obligations related
to certain retiree benefits as discussed further in Note 7. See
Note 4 for further discussion of the Company’s obligations under

capital leases.

Insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the workers’
compensation program. The Company carries various large risk
deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of
workers’ compensation liabilities. The Company records the workers’
compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an
independent actuary. The analysis calculates development factors,
which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various
insurance companies who underwrite the program. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these
liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience
or significant changes in these assumptions may materially
affect workers’ compensation costs.

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority of group health
insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported
is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the
Company’s claims administrators. While the Company believes that
the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate,
significant differences from historical trends may materially impact
financial results. These reserves are included in accrued expenses in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are
expected to be paid within one year.

Accumulated
Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is comprised of
the following:

F-10


1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade
accounts payable approximate their respective fair values based
on the short-term nature of these instruments. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the fair market value of fixed rate long-term debt
was approximately $511,000,000 and $526,000,000, respectively,
based primarily on quoted prices for these or similar instruments.
The fair value of fixed rate long-term debt was estimated by calculating
the present value of anticipated cash flows. The discount rate
used was an estimated borrowing rate for similar debt instruments
with like maturities.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are classified as selling, administrative
and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income and totaled approximately $267,000,000,
$238,000,000, and $216,000,000 in the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled
$49,700,000, $44,100,000, and $41,500,000 in the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Stock Compensation

The Company maintains various Long-Term Incentive Plans, which
provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards,
dividend equivalents and other share-based awards.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company prospectively adopted
the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation.
The Company recognizes compensation expense based on the
straight-line method. Until January 1, 2003, the Company had
elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”), and
related Interpretations in accounting for stock compensation.
Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized if
the exercise price of stock options equaled or exceeded the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Pro forma information
regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by SFAS No. 123, as amended, determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to
December 31, 1994, under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

Effective January 1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
choosing the “modified prospective” method. Compensation cost
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a)
compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to,
but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS
No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results
for prior periods have not been restated. Most options may be
exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later than ten
years from the date of grant. As of January 1, 2006, there was
approximately $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost
for all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 to employees that
remained unvested prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R).
This compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately four years.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. The computation of diluted net income
per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options and
non-vested restricted stock awards. For the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, the dilutive effect of options to purchase
approximately 12,000, and 12,000 shares of common stock,
respectively, at an average exercise price of approximately $18 per
share issued in connection with a 1998 acquisition have been
included in the computation of diluted net income per common
share since the date of the acquisition. These shares were exercised
on May 15, 2006 and therefore are included in the basic calculation
for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (“FIN No. 48”),
to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax
positions. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN
No. 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. While the Company has
not yet completed its analysis, the Company does not expect that
the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have a significant impact on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

On
September 15, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company does not expect SFAS No. 157 will have a significant
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

F-11


On
September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS No. 158”), which amends SFAS No.
87 and SFAS No. 106 to require recognition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit
plans on the consolidated balance sheet. Under SFAS No. 158,
gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and any remaining
transition amounts under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 that
have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will
be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income,
net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net
periodic cost. SFAS No. 158 is effective for publicly-held companies
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company
adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158
at December 31, 2006, as more fully discussed in Note 7. SFAS
No. 158 has no impact on the consolidated statement of income
for the year ended December 31, 2006.

2. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company performed an
annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment
test during the fourth quarter of 2006, 2005, and 2004. The
present value of future cash flows approach was used to determine
any potential impairment. The Company determined that these
assets were not impaired and, therefore, no impairment was recognized
for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 by reportable segment,
as well as other identifiable intangible assets, are summarized as

3. Credit Facilities

The principal amount of the Company’s borrowings subject to
variable rates totaled approximately $881,000 at December 31,
2005. There were no amounts subject to variable rates at
December 31, 2006. The weighted average interest rate on the
Company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 6.05%
at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The Company maintains a $350,000,000 unsecured revolving
line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions that
matures in October 2008 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .25%
(5.57% at December 31, 2006). No amounts were outstanding
under this line of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Certain
borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt-to-equity
ratio, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio, and certain
limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2006,
the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Due to
the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements
in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit
of $58,955,000 and $52,600,000 outstanding at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Amounts

4. Leased Properties

In June 2003, the Company completed an amended and restated
master agreement to our $85,000,000 construction and lease
agreement (the “Agreement”). The lessor in the Agreement is an
independent third-party limited liability company, which has as its
sole member a publicly traded corporation. Properties acquired by
the lessor are constructed and/or then leased to the Company under
operating lease agreements. No additional properties are being
added to this Agreement, as the construction term has ended. The
Company does not believe the lessor is a variable interest entity, as
defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51

(“FIN No. 46”).
In addition, the Company has verified that even if the lessor was
determined to be a variable interest entity, the Company would
not have to consolidate the lessor nor the assets and liabilities
associated with properties leased to the Company. This is because
the assets leased under the Agreement do not exceed 50% of the
total fair value of the lessor’s assets, excluding any assets that
should be excluded from such calculation under FIN No. 46, nor
did the lessor finance 95% or more of the leased balance with
non-recourse debt, target equity or similar funding. The Agreement
has been accounted for as an operating lease under SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

(“SFAS No. 13”) and related interpretations.
Future minimum rental commitments under the Agreement have
been included in the table of future minimum payments below.

Rent expense related to the Agreement is recorded under selling,
administrative and other expenses in our consolidated statements
of income and was $4,797,000, $3,338,000, and $1,745,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Buildings includes $15,400,000 with accumulated depreciation of
$6,917,000, for leases of distribution centers and stores capitalized
at December 31, 2006. Depreciation expense for capital leases was
approximately $4,585,000, $3,466,000, and $2,776,000 in 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively.

Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under the
capital and noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining
terms of one year or more consisted of the following at December
31, 2006 (in thousands):

5. Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards

The Company maintains various Long-Term Incentive Plans, which
provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards,
dividend equivalents and other share-based awards. The Company
issues new shares upon option exercise under these plans.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company prospectively adopted
the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation.
The Company recognizes compensation expense based on the
straight-line method for all award types, including SARs, which
are subject to graded vesting based on a service condition. Until
January 1, 2003, the Company had elected to follow APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations
in accounting for stock compensation. Under APB No. 25,
no compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of
stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant. Pro forma information regarding
net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123,
as amended, determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options granted subsequent to December 31,
1994, under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

Effective January 1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
choosing the “modified prospective” method. Compensation cost
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a)
compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to,
but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated with the provisions of SFAS No.
123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Most
options may be exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later
than ten years from the date of grant. As of January 1, 2006,
there was approximately $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation
cost for all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 to
employees that remained unvested prior to the effective date of
SFAS No. 123(R). This compensation cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately four years.

F-13


For the year ended December 31, 2006, total compensation cost
related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately
$20.2 million. The weighted-average period over which this
compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately
three years. The aggregate intrinsic value for options and RSUs
outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2006 was approximately
$56.4 million and $74.6 million, respectively. The aggregate
intrinsic value for options and RSUs vested totaled approximately
$39.0 million and $46.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2006,
respectively. At December 31, 2006, the weighted-average contractual
life for outstanding and exercisable options and RSUs was
seven and six years, respectively. For the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, $11.9 million, $6.9 million and $2.5
million of share-based compensation cost was recorded, respectively.
The total income tax benefit recognized in the income
statement for share-based compensation arrangements was approximately
$4.8 million, $2.8 million and $1.0 million for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. There have been no modifications
to valuation methodologies or methods subsequent to the adoption
of SFAS No. 123(R).

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 the fair
value for options and SARs granted was estimated using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 4.8%,
4.1% and 4.0%; dividend yield of 2.9%, 3.2% and 3.7%; annual
historical volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company’s common stock of 21%, 23% and 23%; an expected life
and estimated turnover based on the historical pattern of existing
grants of six, six and eight years and 4.0% to 4.4%, respectively.
The fair value of RSUs is based on the price of the Company’s
stock on the date of the grant. The total fair value of shares
vested during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $6.9 million, $8.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148

Accounting for
Stock-Based

Compensation Transition and Disclosure,

an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and income per share if the fair value based
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period (in thousands, except
per share amounts):

Total includes 94,000 Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”). The weighted average
exercise price excludes RSUs. The exercise prices for options outstanding as of
December 31, 2006 ranged from approximately $21 to $44. The weighted-average
remaining contractual life of all options outstanding is approximately seven years.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted
during the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $9.14, $8.58 and
$6.94, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised
during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
was $10.7 million, $19.6 million and $18.1 million, respectively.

In 2006, the Company granted approximately 1,246,000 Stock
Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) and 94,000 RSUs. In 2005, the
Company granted approximately 1,169,000 SARs and 91,000
RSUs. In 2004, the Company granted approximately 1,146,000
SARs and 124,000 RSUs. SARs represent a right to receive the
excess, if any, of the fair market value of one share of common
stock on the date of exercise over the grant price. RSUs represent
a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common
stock at a future date provided certain pre-tax profit targets are
achieved. The majority of awards vest on a pro-rata basis for
periods ranging from one to five years and are expensed accordingly
on a straight-line basis.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented
all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of
cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from
the tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation
cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits)
to be classified as financing cash inflow. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, approximately $3.0 million of excess tax
benefits was classified as a financing cash inflow.

6. Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax
purposes. Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As such, no
U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon,
and it is not practicable to determine the amount of the related
unrecognized deferred income tax liability. Significant components
of the Company’s deferred tax assets are as follows:

7. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s defined benefit pension plans cover substantially
all of its employees in the U.S. and Canada. The plan covering
U.S. employees is noncontributory and benefits are based on the
employees’ compensation during the highest five of their last ten
years of credited service. The Canadian plan is contributory and
benefits are based on career average compensation. The Company’s
funding policy is to fund amounts deductible for income tax
purposes.

The Company also sponsors unfunded supplemental retirement
plans covering employees in the U.S. and Canada and other
postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. The Company uses a
measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other postretirement
benefit plans.

On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, which amends SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 to require
recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension
and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet.
Under SFAS No. 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and
credits, and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS No. 87
and SFAS No. 106 that have not yet been recognized through net
periodic benefit cost are to be recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized
as a component of net periodic cost. SFAS No. 158 is effective for
publicly-held companies for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2006. The incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 was to
reduce other long-term assets by $411,714,000. In addition, other
current liabilities were increased by $5,036,000; other long-term
liabilities were increased by $55,406,000, a deferred tax asset was
recorded for $187,371,000 and shareholders’ equity was reduced
by an amount recorded to accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
income of $284,785,000, net of taxes.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the plan held 2,016,932 shares of
common stock of the Company with a market value of approximately
$95,663,000 and $88,584,000, respectively. Dividend payments
received by the plan on Company stock totaled approximately
$2,723,000 and $2,521,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Fees
paid during the year for services rendered by parties-in-interest
were based on customary and reasonable rates for such services.

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada
establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor
the performance of the funds. The pension plan strategy implemented
by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term
objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the
applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as
fiduciary standards. The long-term primary objectives for the
pension plans are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term
growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk, protect the
assets from erosion of purchasing power, and provide investment
results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed
long term rates of return.

Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as
an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s asset
allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected rate
of return on plan assets for measuring 2007 pension expense
or income is 8.25% for the plans. The asset study forecasted
expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the
Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and
historical relationships.

For the pension benefits, the following table reflects the total benefits expected to be paid
from the plans’ or the Company’s assets. Of the pension benefits expected to be paid in 2007,
$2,272,000 is expected to be paid from employer assets. Expected contributions reflect amounts
expected to be contributed to funded plans. For other postretirement benefits, the table below
reflects only the Company’s share of the benefit cost without regard to income from federal subsidy
payments received pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (MMA). Expected MMA subsidy payments, which will reduce the Company’s cost for the plan, are
shown separately.

The Company has a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all of its domestic employees. The Company’s
matching contributions are determined based on 20% of the
first 6% of the covered employee’s salary. Total plan expense
was approximately $6,824,000 in 2006, $6,722,000 in
2005, and $6,034,000 in 2004.

8. Guarantees

The amended and restated master agreement to our $85,000,000
construction and lease agreement (the “Agreement”), discussed
further in Note 4, has a term of six years expiring in 2009 and
contains residual value guarantee provisions and other guarantees
which would become due in the event of a default under the
operating lease agreement, or at the expiration of the operating
lease agreement if the fair value of the leased properties is less
than the guaranteed residual value. The maximum amount of
the Company’s potential guarantee obligation, representing the
residual value guarantee, at December 31, 2006, is approximately
$72,640,000. The Company believes the likelihood of funding the
guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease
agreements is remote.

The Company also guarantees the borrowings of certain independently
controlled automotive parts stores (independents)
and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a minority
equity ownership interest (affiliates). Presently, the independents
are generally consolidated by unaffiliated enterprises that have
a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity. The Company has no voting interest
or other equity conversion rights in any of the independents. The
Company does not control the independents or the affiliates, but
receives a fee for the guarantee. The Company has concluded that
it is not the primary beneficiary with respect to any of the independents
and that the affiliates are not variable interest entities.
The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to
the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee.

At December 31, 2006, the total borrowings of the independents
and affiliates subject to guarantee by the Company were approximately
$186,473,000. These loans generally mature over periods
from one to ten years. In the event that the Company is required
to make payments in connection with guaranteed obligations of
the independents or the affiliates, the Company would obtain and
liquidate certain collateral (e.g. accounts receivable and inventory)
to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee.
When it is deemed probable that the Company will incur a loss in
connection with a guarantee, a liability is recorded equal to this
estimated loss. To date, the Company has had no significant
losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and
affiliates’ borrowings.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

In accordance with FIN No. 45 and based on available information,
the Company has accrued for those guarantees related to the
independent and affiliates’ borrowings and the construction
and lease agreement as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. These
liabilities are not material to the financial position of the Company
and are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

9. Segment Data

The Company’s automotive segment distributes replacement
parts (other than body parts) for substantially all makes and
models of automobiles, trucks and other vehicles.

The Company’s industrial segment distributes a wide variety
of industrial bearings, mechanical and fluid power transmission
equipment, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material
handling components, and related parts and supplies.

The Company’s office products segment distributes a wide variety
of office products, computer supplies, office furniture, and
business electronics.

The Company’s electrical/electronic materials segment distributes a
wide variety of electrical/electronic materials, including insulating and
conductive materials for use in electronic and electrical apparatus.

The Company’s reportable segments consist of automotive, industrial,
office products and electrical/electronic materials. Within the
reportable segments, certain of the Company’s operating segments
are aggregated because they have similar: economic characteristics,
products and services, type and class of customers, and distribution
methods. Inter-segment sales are not significant. Operating
profit for each industry segment is calculated as net sales less
operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses, interest
expense, equity in income from investees, amortization and
minority interests. Approximately $43,500,000, $39,700,000,
and $34,700,000 of income before income taxes was generated
in jurisdictions outside the United States for the years ending
December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Net sales and
net long-lived assets by country relate directly to the Company’s
operations in the respective country. Corporate assets are principally
cash and cash equivalents and headquarters’ facilities and
equipment.

For management purposes, net sales by segment exclude the effect
of certain discounts, incentives and freight billed to customers. The
line item “other” represents the net effect of the discounts, incentives
and freight billed to customers, which are reported as a component of
net sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
