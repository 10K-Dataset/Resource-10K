In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm equipment, marine equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.

The Company's automotive parts network was expanded in


via the acquisition of various store groups and automotive operations in North America, Europe and Australasia.



AAG made a number of acquisitions to further expand their automotive operations in 2019, consisting of several small tuck-in businesses and three larger ones. Hennig Fahrzeugteile ("Hennig"), acquired on January 1, 2019, is headquartered in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, and is one of Germany's leading suppliers of vehicle parts.  Hennig serves more than 9,000 customers, predominantly independent workshops and retailers.

Distribution System

.

In


, the Company operated 56 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution centers located in 39 states and approximately 1,130 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 44 states. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company had either a noncontrolling, controlling or other interest in 8 corporations, which operated approximately 256 auto parts stores in 15 states. The Company’s domestic automotive operations have access to approximately 530,000 different parts and related supply items. These items are purchased from more than 100 different suppliers, with approximately 49% of


automotive parts inventories purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company's domestic operations have had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve the company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores and approximately 4,800 independently-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the U.S. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, sales to these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 61% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 20% of the Company’s total sales.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a leader in the distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks and is also a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries in Canada. NAPA Canada/UAP operates a network of nine NAPA automotive parts distribution centers, three heavy duty parts distribution centers and one fabrication/remanufacturing facility supplying 592 NAPA stores and 120 Traction wholesalers. The NAPA stores and Traction wholesalers in Canada include 207 company-owned stores, 11 joint ventures and 24 progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and 470 independently owned stores. NAPA and Traction operations supply bannered installers and independent installers in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service stations and repair shops operating under the banners of national accounts.

These products are categorized into over 238 different product categories purchased from approximately 500 domestic suppliers and over 100 foreign manufacturers. Balkamp provides the NAPA system with over 1,300



SKUs of oils and chemicals. BALKAMP

®

, a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.

The Company's Rayloc division operates four facilities focused on providing cost effective, quality service in engineering, cataloging, global sourcing, and distribution. Rayloc delivers over 10,000 part numbers, including brake pads, brake drums, chassis, and bearings through a nationwide distribution network.

Finally, the Company operates domestically two TW Distribution heavy duty parts distribution centers which serve 22 company-owned Traction Heavy Duty parts stores located in eight states. This group distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small and large fleet owners and operators.

Products

.

The Company’s automotive distribution network provides access to hundreds of thousands of different parts and related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. The majority of orders are filled and shipped the same day they are received. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed in North America under the NAPA

®

name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products. Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market. In Australasia and Europe, products are distributed under several brand names, including many of the national brands.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores

.

The Company believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its North American automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.

The Company has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances, including predictive analytics, and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 25 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

NAPA

.

The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, LLC a voluntary association formed in 1925 to promote the distribution of automotive parts for its members. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose sole member in


owned and operated 56 distribution centers located throughout the U.S. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at

December 31, 2019

, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive products purchased by the Company from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. Generally, the Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and it may, and does, purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources.

The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA

®

as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company funds NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with the former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

Competition

.

The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes



with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains), and with other parts distributors and retailers, including online retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group operates in both North America and Australasia. Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, operates in North America.  Inenco Group ("Inenco"), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company headquartered in Sydney, Australia, operates across Australasia.

Motion distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission products, industrial automation and robotics, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components, industrial and safety supplies and material handling products to MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”). The Mexican market is served by Motion Mexico S de RL de CV (“Motion Mexico”).

In


, Motion served approximately 200,000 customers in all types of industries located throughout North America, including the equipment and machinery, food and beverage, forest products, primary metals, pulp and paper, mining, automotive, oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted specialty industries such as power generation, alternative energy, government, transportation, ports, and others. Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of 8.7 million parts. Additionally, Motion provides U.S. government agencies access to approximately 72,000 products and replacement parts through a Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule.

The Company's Industrial Parts Group network expanded in


via the acquisition of various tuck-in acquisitions and industrial operations in North America and Australasia. In North America, the Company expanded its industrial operations with two tuck-in acquisitions, which in total are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $78 million.

In Australasia, the Company purchased the remaining 65% stake in Inenco, a leading distributor of industrial replacement parts and accessories in Australasia. In total, Inenco is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $400 million.

The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through the Company’s On-Site Solutions offering. This service provides inventory management, asset repair and tracking, vendor managed inventory ("VMI"), as well as radio frequency identification ("RFID") asset management of the customer’s inventory.  Motion also provides a wide range of services and repairs such as: gearbox and fluid power assembly and repair, process pump assembly and repair, hydraulic drive shaft repair, electrical panel assembly and repair, hose and gasket manufacture and assembly, as well as many other value-added services. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer. These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in providing the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect.

Distribution System

.

In North America, the Industrial Parts Group stocks and distributes more than 195,000 different items purchased from more than 880 different suppliers. Its service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 40% of total industrial product purchases in


were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s facilities located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and nine provinces in Canada and Mexico.

In Australasia, the Industrial Parts Group operated a network of distribution centers and branches across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore as of December 31, 2019.

Most branches have warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market areas served.

Products

.

The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its customers, which are primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, industrial supplies, assembly tools, test equipment, adhesives and chemicals. Motion also offers systems and automation products that support sophisticated motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment.  The nature of Motion's business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with many of its national account customers which, collectively, represent approximately 45% of the annual sales volume.



Supply Agreements

.

Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent.

Competition

.

The industrial parts distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”

Senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, the media and others that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to future operations, including the anticipated synergies and benefits of any acquisitions or divestitures, as well as prospects, strategies, including the 2019 Cost Savings Plan, financial condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry conditions and demand for our products and services. The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent Forms 10-Q, 8-K and other reports filed with the SEC.

Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our securities.

We may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow our sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, strategic acquisitions, geographic expansion (including through acquisitions), sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. If we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if these initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors contained in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:

•

the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or to increase promotional spending;

•

our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for our products in a timely manner;

•

our ability to successfully enter new markets, including by successfully identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition targets in these new markets;

•

our ability to effectively manage our costs;

•

our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses in our existing operations, including in particular the challenges associated with the integration of foreign operations to ensure the adequacy of internal controls;

•

our ability to identify and successfully implement appropriate technological, digital and e-commerce solutions;

•

the occurrence of unusually severe weather events, which can disrupt our operations (forcing temporary closure of retail and distribution centers, prohibiting shipment of inventory and products) and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies;

•

the occurrence of political unrest and strikes, which can disrupt our operations and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies;

•

volatility in oil prices, which could have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states in which we operate;



•

the adequacy of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; and

•

the economy in general, including the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment and short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and the fiscal policies of the U.S. government.

Our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows.

Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.

With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the number of vehicles in the automotive fleet, a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates, as a steady or growing total vehicle population supports the continued demand for maintenance and repair;

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles;

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;

•

the addition of electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, ride sharing services, alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto;

•

gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles;

•

changes in travel patterns, which may cause consumers to rely more on other transportation;

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks; and

•

the economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer discretionary spending.

With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors are:

•

the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization, as these indices reflect the need for industrial replacement parts;

•

changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy;

•

the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas, which subsequently reduces demand for our products;

•

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies which could impact international trade among our multi-national customer base and cause reduced demand for our products; and

•

the economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output.

With respect to our business products group, the primary factors are:

•

consolidation of customers and consolidation of the industry;

•

the increasing digitization of the workplace, as this negatively impacts the need for certain office products;

•

the level of unemployment, especially as it relates to white collar and service jobs, as high unemployment reduces the need for office products;

•

the level of office vacancy rates, as high vacancy rates reduces the need for office products; and

•

the economy in general, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for business products consumption.



Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Certain political developments, including, among others: (i) the results of elections in the U.S. and globally and the impact of such results on political decision-making, and (ii) unrest in the U.K. and Europe, have resulted in increased economic uncertainty for multi-national companies operating within the U.K. and Europe. These developments may result in economic and trade policy actions that could impact economic conditions in many countries and continue to change the landscape of international trade. Our business is global, so changes to existing international trade agreements, blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues and/or increases in pricing, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.  For instance, the United States imposed Section 232 tariffs on many imported products of steel and aluminum in March 2018 and expanded the tariffs to additional derivative products of steel and aluminum effective February 8, 2020.  The United States imposed Section 301 tariffs on most imported products from China starting in July 2018. Although the United States and China reached a Phase One trade deal in January 2020, most of these tariffs remain in place and uncertainty persists in the trade relationship between the two countries that impacts the global trade landscape. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Act, which reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.

The U.K.'s exit from the European Union (“E.U.”) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited from the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). While a transition period of 11-month begins, during which the U.K. will continue to follow the E.U. rules, including remaining a member of the E.U. single market and Customs union, the final U.K./E.U. relationship is still uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. Brexit has impacted global markets, including various currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies.  The fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. Volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its new rules and trade deals with the E.U. during the transition period and after. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of final tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.

Uncertainty and/or deterioration in general macro-economic conditions domestically and globally, including unemployment, inflation or deflation, changes in tax policies, changes in energy costs, uncertain credit markets, or other economic conditions, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions, including domestic outputs, political uncertainty and unrest, employment rates, inflation or deflation, changes in tax policies, instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. Both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources, which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products. Our vendors could experience similar negative conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. Future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.

The sale of automotive parts, industrial parts and business products is highly competitive and impacted by many factors, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, changing customer preferences, store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we may be forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased competition among distributors of automotive, industrial parts and office products, including increased availability among digital and e-commerce providers across the markets in which we do business, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its three business segments in the foreseeable future.

In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with national, international and regional auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers, internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops, both new and established.

Furthermore, both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industries continue to experience consolidation. Consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position, provide them with the ability to offer more



competitive prices to customers for whom we compete, and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

In addition, the loss or significant reduction in purchase volume of a major customer in the business products group could significantly impact its results of operations.

We depend on our relationships with our suppliers, and a disruption of our suppliers relationships or a disruption in our suppliers’ operations could harm our business.

As a distributor of automotive parts, industrial parts and business products, our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our suppliers. We depend on our suppliers to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, raw material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity, labor disputes, tariff legislation, transportation disruptions, tax and other legislative uncertainties, pandemics and/or weather conditions, could adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner.

Furthermore, financial or operational difficulties with a particular suppliers could cause that suppliers to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. In addition, we would suffer an adverse impact if our suppliers limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The impact to our supply chain cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. At the time of this filing, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in China, although cases have been confirmed in other countries. The Company does not currently sell any products in China, but it does source a portion of its products from China. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.

We recognize the growing demand for business-to-business and business-to-customer digital and e-commerce options and solutions, and we could lose business if we fail to provide the digital and e-commerce options and solutions our customers wish to use.

Our success in digital and e-commerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through digital and e-commerce platforms across our business segments, and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide an efficient on-line experience with the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use (including mobile) with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment.

If we experience a security breach, if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing, integrating or upgrading our information systems, our business operations could be materially affected.

We depend on information systems to process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost effective operations, provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results, among many other things.

Despite our implementation of various security measures, our IT systems and operations could be subject to damages or interruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized physical or electronic access, power outages, telecommunications failure, computer system or network failures, wire transfer failure, employee error/malfeasance, cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other similar disruptions. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of IT systems change frequently and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. Maintaining, operating, and protecting these systems and related personal information about our employees, customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures, employee training, and third-party services which the Company has made and will continue to make. A security breach could result in, among other things, sensitive and confidential data being lost, manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory. While we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information, there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised.

A serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses, decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers, employees or suppliers' information. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, compliance with these requirements could also result in



significant additional costs. As threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent, it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure.

Our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.

We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. Additionally, we consider and enter into divestitures from time to time, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in cost savings and various other benefits. Strategic divestitures are subject to uncertainty and can be a complex and time-consuming process. If the divestiture is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the divestiture.

Because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm.

We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various reasons. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, we are subject to numerous laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes, environmental protection, product quality standards, data privacy, building and zoning requirements, and employment law matters. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons could harm our business.

Our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. We believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan. We also will need to continue to attract, motivate and retain other key personnel. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees, the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.

We have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:

•

make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements;

•

limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms; and

•

expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.

In addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The



occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition.

GAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs.

Our stock price is subject to fluctuations, and the value of your investment may decline.

The trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations, and may be subject to fluctuations in the future based upon external economic and market conditions. The stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. These broad market, geopolitical and industry factors among others may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance and growth outlook, and the value of your investment may decline.

We may be affected by global climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.

The concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”). For example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to GHG continue to be considered by policy makers in the U.S. and elsewhere. Laws enacted to reduce GHG could directly or indirectly affect our suppliers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.

Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, investors, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected. As we continue to grow our business, our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources. Any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results. In addition, if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of each fiscal year end, we may be exposed to negative publicity, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price.

Additionally, the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause



stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.

We may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, for our variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities.

Our business relies upon a large volume of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict whether banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates is likely to occur during the next several years.

While we have established a working group consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company to monitor developments relating to LIBOR uncertainty and changes and to guide the Company’s response, the impact of these developments on our business and financial results is not yet known. The transition from LIBOR may cause us to incur increased costs and additional risk. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans originated prior to 2021. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently, which may affect our net interest income, change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk, pricing and hedging strategies. Any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.

OVERVIEW

Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the global distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts and business products. We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In


, the Company conducted business in North America, Europe and Australasia from approximately

3,600

locations.

The Company's Automotive Parts Group operated in the U.S., Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand in


, and accounted for

57%

of total revenues for the year. Our Industrial Parts Group entered


with operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and expanded its operations into Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore in July


with the addition of the Inenco business. The Industrial Parts Group accounted for

34%

of the Company's total revenues in


. Our Business Products Group operated in the U.S. and Canada in


, although its Canadian operations were divested, effective January 1, 2020. The Business Products Group accounted for

9%

of total revenues in


.



At Genuine Parts Company, our mission is to be a world-class service organization and the employer of choice, supplier of choice, valued customer, good corporate citizen and investment of choice. Our strategic financial objectives are intended to align with our mission and drive value for all our stakeholders. Our strategic financial objectives include: (1) top line revenue growth (2) improved operating margin, (3) strong balance sheet and cash flow and (4) effective capital allocation.

Top Line Revenue

The Company's strategy for top line revenue growth includes a combination of organic and acquisitive initiatives designed to outpace the industry, improve the market share in each of our business segments and position the Company for sustained long-term growth. In 2019, this strategy led to

1.7%

comparable sales growth and a

4.6%

contribution from acquisitions. Comparable store sales (also called organic sales or core sales) refer to period‑over‑period comparisons of our net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency.

Our strategic initiatives also led us to divest of certain non-core businesses determined to be slower-growth and lower-margin operations. These divestitures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset our total sales growth for the year.

Operating Margins

The Company targets continuous operating margin improvement each year. In 2019, the competitive dynamics across our businesses, as well as the continued cost pressures and the need to invest in a more productive and efficient cost structure led us to expand and accelerate our initiatives to improve the operating performance of the Company. These efforts produced improved gross margins in 2019 and we believe created a path for significant cost savings in the years ahead.

In October of 2019, the Company approved and began to implement certain restructuring actions across its subsidiaries primarily targeted at simplifying organizational structures and distribution networks (the "2019 Cost Savings Plan"). The Company expects the 2019 Cost Savings Plan to result in $100 million in annualized operating expense reductions by allowing it to more effectively and efficiently manage its businesses. Among other things, the 2019 Cost Savings Plan will result in workforce reductions and facility closures and consolidations. The Company executed a voluntary retirement program ("VRP") for its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with this plan. The Company is well underway in executing the 2019 Cost Savings Plan.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

The Company is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows to support our growth initiatives. In 2019, we deployed less total working capital and improved our working capital efficiency, or working capital as a percent of total revenues, to

8.0%

.

The Company generated

$892.0 million

in cash from operations and also benefited from cash proceeds associated with the sale of certain non-core businesses in 2019, as noted before. We utilized our cash for effective capital allocation.

Capital Allocation

The Company's priorities for effective capital allocation have remained consistent for many years. In 2019, we used cash for key investments in the form of capital expenditures and accretive acquisitions, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders via cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our results of operations are summarized below for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


.

Net Sales

Consolidated net sales for the year ended

December 31, 2019

totaled

$19.4 billion

, up

3.5%

from


.


net sales included an approximate

4.6%

contribution from acquisitions, net of store closures and an approximate

1.7%

increase in core sales. The Company's sale of certain non-core businesses determined to be slower-growth and lower-margin operations partially offset total sales by

1.4%

. Additionally, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset total sales by

1.4%

.



The Company's core sales growth, which represents the Company's comparable sales, included both the increase in sales volume and product inflation. The impact of product inflation varied by business segment in


, with prices up approximately

2.4%

in the U.S. Automotive and Industrial segments and up approximately

3.0%

in the Business Products segment. Due to the Company's global initiatives to grow revenues, we believe it is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.

Automotive Group

Net sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) were

$11.0 billion

in


, a

4.4%

increase from


. The increase in sales consists of an approximate

5.0%

contribution from acquisitions, a

2.3%

comparable sales increase and a

2.3%

negative impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in Canada, Australasia, Europe and Mexico. In addition, the sale of Auto Todo in 2019, the Company's legacy automotive business in Mexico, slightly offset total sales for the Automotive Group.

Automotive sales were positively impacted by product inflation of

2.4%

in the U.S. operations. In


, total Automotive revenues were up approximately

2.3%

in the first quarter, up

1.4%

in the second quarter, up

5.3%

in the third quarter and up

8.7%

in the fourth quarter, with the higher third and fourth quarter increases due to the positive impact of various acquisitions. In particular, we expanded our European footprint in June with the acquisition of PartsPoint Group in the Netherlands and Belgium. Sound industry fundamentals and effective growth strategies drove organic growth of approximately

3%

or more in the U.S., Canada and Australasia. This was offset by core sales declines in our European operations, which faced several challenges in 2019 primarily related to regional economic and geopolitical concerns. Our team in Europe worked throughout the year to navigate these challenges, resulting in improved sales trends in Europe in the last half of the year. In our view, the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including trends related to the overall number and age of the vehicle population, as well as the continued increase in miles driven, remain supportive of sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items across the markets we serve. We expect these fundamentals and our ongoing sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the Automotive Group in 2020.

Industrial Parts Group

Net sales for the Industrial Parts Group (“Industrial”) were

$6.5 billion

in


, up

3.6%

from


. The increase in sales reflects an approximate

5.2%

contribution from acquisitions and a

1.7%

increase in comparable sales, offset by an approximate

3.1%

decrease in net sales related to the sale of EIS, a non-core component of the industrial business due to its slower-growth and lower-margin profile. Total Industrial sales were positively impacted by product inflation of

2.4%

, as a portion of this increase was passed through to customers and is included in the comparable sales increase. Industrial revenues were up approximately

5.7%

in the first quarter of


, up

4.9%

in the second quarter, up

9.9%

in the third quarter and down

5.9%

in the fourth quarter. These quarterly results reflect the impact of several factors, including the slowing trend in the industrial economy throughout the course of the year, as evidenced by weakening economic indicators such as Manufacturing Industrial Production and the Purchasing Managers Index, among others. In addition, the July acquisition of Inenco, one of Australasia's leading industrial distributors, and the sale of EIS on September 30, 2019, impacted the quarterly sales comparisons for the Industrial Group in 2019. We are confident in our growth plans for 2020, both in North America and Australasia, but also expect to experience a relatively slow industrial economy through at least the first half of the year.

Business Products Group

Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group (“Business Products”), were

$1.9 billion

in


, a decrease of

1.8%

from


. The decrease in sales reflects the decline in core sales and was especially pronounced in the fourth quarter, which was significantly slower relative to the first three quarters of the year

due

to

industry consolidation

and

incr

eased

competition.

Sales were up approximately

1.0%

in the first quarter, down

1.1%

in the second quarter, down

0.9%

in the third quarter and down

6.3%

in the fourth quarter of


. While the business products industry continues to face significant challenges, our strategy to diversify our traditional product offering into the large and growing Facilities, Breakroom and Safety Supplies ("FBS") category has partially offset these challenges. On January 1, 2020, we divested of our Canadian operations in the Business Products Group to simplify our business model and focus on our U.S. operations. As we look ahead, we remain focused on our core growth initiatives and maximizing the growth prospects for our diversified business, but will also continue to evaluate all opportunities that may help us more effectively navigate the evolving industry dynamics in which this group competes.

Cost of Goods Sold

The Company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise, which represents the vast majority of this line item. Other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in-bound freight from the suppliers, net of any vendor allowances and incentives. Cost of goods sold was

$13.1 billion

in


, a

2.5%

increase from $

12.8 billion

in


. The increase in cost of goods sold in


compares to a

3.5%

total sales increase and is a positive reflection of our global supply chain initiatives, the lower cost of goods sold models at certain acquired companies such as PartsPoint and Inenco, and the sale of the lower margin EIS business. These items were slightly offset by relatively unchanged levels of supplier incentives in


compared to


. Cost of goods sold represented

67.4%

of net sales in


, decreasing from

68.1%

of net sales in


.



In


and


, each of the Company's business segments experienced vendor price increases. In 2019, tariffs on certain goods sourced directly or indirectly from China were a contributing factor in the price increases for the automotive and business products segments. Historically where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these increases along to them.

Operating Expenses

The Company includes in selling, administrative and other expenses (“SG&A”) all personnel and personnel-related costs at its headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for more than

60%

of total SG&A. Additional costs in SG&A include our facilities, delivery, marketing, advertising, technology, digital, legal and professional costs.

SG&A of

$4.9 billion

in


increased by

$0.3 billion

or approximately

6.9%

from


. This represents

25.4%

of net sales in


compared to

24.6%

of net sales in


. The increase in SG&A expenses from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including the impact of increased sales for the year. In addition, our expenses reflect the impact of higher cost and higher gross margin models at certain acquired businesses, including PartsPoint and Inenco, as well as the sale of EIS, which had a lower level of SG&A expenses relative to total sales. We also experienced rising costs in areas such as labor, freight and delivery, insurance, legal and professional and technology for the year, although our labor and freight costs trended more favorably in the fourth quarter. Further, we incurred incremental costs associated with our acquisitions during the year. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in


relative to the prior year reflects the cost increases described above as well as the loss of leverage associated with the

1.7%

comparable sales growth for the Company.

To improve on our SG&A expense levels, we continue to execute on our growth initiatives to better leverage our expenses. Additionally, we are working towards a lower cost and highly effective infrastructure via steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions, investments to enhance our productivity and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies across our operations. Through the 2019 Costs Savings Plan discussed above, the Company expects to reduce expenses by an annualized run-rate of

$100 million

by the end of 2020.

Depreciation and amortization expense was

$270.3 million

in


, an increase of approximately

$28.7 million

, or

11.9%

, from


, due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year. The provision for doubtful accounts was

$14.9 million

in


, a

$2.2 million

decrease from


. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at

December 31, 2019

.

In addition, the Company approved and began to implement the 2019 Cost Savings Plan discussed above, which resulted in the recognition of

$112.2 million

in restructuring costs that are accounted for as a component of operating expenses. The restructuring costs are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs, including a voluntary retirement program, and facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of operations. Refer to the restructuring footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to its Business Products Group totaling

$82.0 million

. S

everal factors that

developed in the

fourth

quarter

of


led to this charge, including

:

(i) greater uncertainty associated with long-term industry trends and the competitive environment and (ii) fourth quarter results, including segment profitability, that were below management expectations due primarily to a reduction in volume with certain national account customers

. Management concluded that no other assets were impaired

. Refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

If there are sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions in future periods affecting the projected earnings and cash flows at our reporting units, among other things, there can be no assurance that goodwill at one or more reporting units may not be impaired. Nonetheless, as of

December 31, 2019

, we believe the remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet is recoverable at each respective reporting unit.

Non-Operating Expenses and Income

Non-operating expenses included interest expense of

$95.7 million

in


and

$101.9 million

in


. The

$6.2 million

decrease in interest expense in


reflects the combination of the repayment of debt throughout the year and lower interest rates on certain variable interest debt instruments. To offset potential rising interest rates, the Company has entered into interest hedge products to increase our fixed interest rate debt relative to total debt.

The Company recorded

$42.8

million in special termination costs related to benefits provided through the Company's defined benefit plans to employees that accepted the VRP package as part of the Company's 2019 Cost Savings Plan. Refer to the restructuring footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In “Other”, the net benefit of interest income, equity method investment income, investment dividends, noncontrolling interests and pension income in


was

$66.0 million

, an approximate

$1.8 million

decrease from the prior year primarily driven by lower interest income.



Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes was

$830.3 million

in


, down

22.8%

from


. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was

4.3%

in


compared to

5.7%

in


. Adjusted for certain costs noted above and presented in Non-GAAP Measures below, income before income taxes was relatively unchanged from the prior year at

$1.1 billion

and

5.7%

of net sales.

Income before income taxes is used as the measure of segment profit for each business segment. Segment profit is calculated as net sales less operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses, interest expense, equity in income from investees, intangible asset amortization, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and other unallocated amounts that are driven by corporate initiatives and adjusted in Non-GAAP Measures (as described further below). Segment profit as a percent of revenues reflects the segment margin for each business segment.

Automotive Group

Automotive's segment profit decreased

2.8%

in


from


and segment margin was

7.6%

in


as compared to

8.1%

in


. The decrease in segment margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to the 2.3% growth in comparable sales for Automotive, as this group requires approximately 3.0% comparable sales growth to leverage its fixed costs. In addition, rising costs in several areas as described above negatively impacted Automotive's segment margin. By geography, the Company's European automotive operations were most challenged in 2019 and primarily account for Automotive's decline in margin for the year. To improve Automotive's segment margin, this group is focused on several initiatives to grow sales and has also enhanced its cost management initiatives to drive savings in 2020 and the years ahead.

Industrial Group

Industrial’s segment profit increased

7.1%

in


from


and segment margin was

8.0%

, an increase from

7.7%

in


. The improvement in segment margin for this group primarily reflects the benefit of improved gross margins, despite the slowing sales trend during the year and 1.7% comparable sales growth. 2019 was a transformative year for Industrial, given the the addition of Inenco in Australasia and sale of EIS. The Company believes that the Industrial Group is well-positioned for further growth in 2020.

Business Products Group

Business Product's segment profit was down

12.4%

in


from


and segment margin decreased to

4.1%

from

4.6%

. The decrease in segment margin primarily reflects the pressures associated with rising costs and the deleveraging of expenses due to the decrease in sales for this group caused by

industry consolidation

and

incr

eased

competition.

Nonetheless, t

he Business Products Group enters 2020 focused on its core growth initiatives, the further diversification of its business and the ongoing evaluation of options for new and enhanced opportunities to maximize the growth prospects for this business.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate of

25.2%

in


increased from

24.6%

in


. The increase in rate is primarily due to geographic income tax rate mix shifts and the impact of one-time transaction and other costs, as well as changes in the realizability of future tax benefit adjustments recorded in the comparable periods.

Net Income

Net income was

$621.1 million

in


, a decrease of

23.4%

from

$810.5 million

in


. On a per share diluted basis, net income was

$4.24

in


, down

22.9%

compared to

$5.50

in


. Net income was

3.2%

of net sales in


compared to

4.3%

of net sales in


. Adjusted net income was

$833.2 million

in


, down

0.3%

from adjusted net income in


. On a per share diluted basis, adjusted net income was

$5.69

, a

0.2%

increase compared to adjusted diluted net income per share of

$5.68

in


. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share, both Non-GAAP measures, in


and


exclude those items noted above. See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for more information and for a reconciliation to GAAP.

Non-GAAP Measures

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and diluted net income per common share to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share to account for the impact of adjustments. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the Company’s ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the Company’s core operations. The Company



does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.

(1) Adjustment reflects restructuring and special termination costs related to the 2019 Cost Savings Plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2019. The costs are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs, including a voluntary retirement program, and facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of operations.

(2) Adjustment reflects a fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge related to our Business Products reporting unit.

(3) Adjustment reflects realized currency and other divestitures losses primarily related to the sale of EIS and Grupo AutoTodo.

(4)  Adjustment reflects a termination fee received in the third quarter of 2018 related to the attempted Business Products Group spin-off .

(5) Adjustment relates to the gain recognized upon remeasuring the Company's preexisting 35% equity investment to fair value upon acquiring the remaining equity of Inenco on July 1, 2019.

(6) Adjustment reflects transaction and other costs related to acquisitions and divestitures in 2019.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company’s cash balance of

$277.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

compares to cash of

$333.5 million

at

December 31, 2018

, as discussed further below. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, the Company used

$724.7 million

for acquisitions and other investing activities,

$438.9 million

for dividends paid to the Company’s shareholders, and

$297.9 million

for investments in the Company via capital expenditures. These items were offset by the Company’s earnings and net cash provided by operating activities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was

1.24

to 1 at

December 31, 2019

and 1.28 to 1 at


, and our liquidity position remains solid. We continue to negotiate extended payment dates with our vendors. Certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions that allow the vendors to receive payment earlier while we pay the financial institution based on the underlying vendor invoice amounts and due dates. The Company’s total debt outstanding at

December 31, 2019

increased by

$282.8 million

or

9.0%

from

December 31, 2018

, due primarily to additional private placement debt to fund various acquisitions.



Sources and Uses of Cash

A summary of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows:

Operating Activities

The Company continues to generate cash, and in


net cash provided by operating activities totaled

$892.0 million

, a

$253.2 million

, or

22.1%

, decrease from


. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in working capital in 2019 as compared to 2018, as the Company's increase in accounts payable was less than in the prior year.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$563.2 million

in


compared to

$496.1 million

in


, a

$67.1 million

, or

13.5%

, increase. In 2019, net cash used in investing activities included

$724.7 million

used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities, an increase of

$446.4 million

, or

160.3%

, from


, and capital expenditures of

$297.9 million

, an increase of

$65.4 million

, or

28.2%

, from the prior year. Capital expenditures were in-line with our original estimate of $300 million for the year, and we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2020 will be in the range of $300 million to $330 million. The Company received

$434.6 million

in proceeds for the divestiture of businesses during the year and

$24.8 million

in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. These items partially offset the net cash used in investing activities described above.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in


totaled

$386.0 million

, a decrease of

$222.9 million

, or

36.6%

, from the

$608.8 million

in cash used in financing activities in


. Primarily, the decrease reflects the net proceeds from debt issued in 2019 as compared to the net payments on debt in 2018. For the years presented, the Company's financing activities also included the use of cash for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the Company’s common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of

$438.9 million

and

$416.0 million

during


and


, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During


and


, the Company repurchased

$74.2 million

and

$92.0 million

, respectively, of the Company’s common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary and is at the discretion of the Company's board of directors.

Notes and Other Borrowings

The Company maintains a $2.6 billion multi-currency Syndicated Facility Agreement (the "Syndicated Facility") with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in October 2022 and bears interest at London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, which is based on the Company’s debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The Company also has the option to increase the borrowing capacity up to an additional $1 billion, as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice. At

December 31, 2019

, approximately $1.4 billion was outstanding under this line of credit. Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately

$65 million

and $64 million outstanding at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

At

December 31, 2019

, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding of $2.0 billion. These borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 2.18% at

December 31, 2019

and 2.71% at

December 31, 2018

. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $91.3 million, $92.1 million and $38.7 million in


,


and 2017, respectively. Refer to the credit facilities footnote the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Contractual and Other Obligations

The following table shows the Company’s approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2019

:



Contractual Obligations

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2019

, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore,

$18.0 million

of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to the income taxes footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings. The following table shows the Company’s approximate commercial commitments as of

December 31, 2019

:

Other Commercial Commitments

In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in


were

$15.8 million

. We expect to make

$6.9 million

in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2020, however, contributions required for 2020 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations.

Share Repurchases

In


, the Company repurchased approximately

0.8 million

shares of its common stock and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately

15.6 million

shares of its common stock at

December 31, 2019

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions



about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories — Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and a majority are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts — Methodology

The Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately

$14.9 million

,

$17.1 million

, and

$13.9 million

, respectively.

Consideration Received from Vendors

The Company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2020 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives.

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Company’s pension plan assets. The plans in Europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rates of return. The Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (47% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 7% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, 5% DJ Global Moderate Index, 3% MSCI Emerging Market Net, and 28% Barclays U.S. Long Govt/Credit).

We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these assumptions.



Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring


pension income is

7.11%

for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.

The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of

3.4%

reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective December 31, 2013. No further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of December 31, 2013. Refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.

Business Combinations

When the Company acquires businesses, it applies the acquisition method of accounting and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, which requires significant estimates and assumptions. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method requires the Company to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period. The Company must complete the accounting during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year. Adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company typically measures customer relationship and other intangible assets using an income approach. Significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset (e.g., future revenue growth rates, operating margins and attrition rates). If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, the Company could record impairment charges. In addition, the Company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If the Company's estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.

Legal and Product Liabilities

The Company accrues for potential losses related to legal disputes, litigation, product liabilities, and regulatory matters when it is probable (more likely than not) that the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

To calculate product liabilities, the Company estimates potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional, similar claims being filed against the Company in the future. To estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future, the Company considers claims pending against the Company, claim filing rates, the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements, and the amount of loss by claim type. The estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using risk-free interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities. The Company uses an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring its product liabilities. Refer to the commitments and contingencies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding product liabilities.

Self Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority of its group health insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the Company’s claims administrators. These reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.

Long-term insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the Company's workers’ compensation program. In addition, the Company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. The Company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis calculates development factors, which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program. While the Company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate,



significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes. In addition, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income, future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent financial operations and tax planning strategies.

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


:

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we approved and began to implement the 2019 Cost Savings Plan, which resulted in recognizing

$154.9 million

in total restructuring costs and special termination costs primarily due to planned workforce reductions and facility closures and consolidations. Also in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Business Products reporting unit totaling

$82.0 million

. Refer to the restructuring footnote and the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share.

The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments, the accrual of bad debts, the accrual of insurance reserves, customer sales returns and volume incentives earned, among others. Inventory adjustments (including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method) are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and LIFO valuation, which is performed each year-end. Reserves for bad debts, insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim



basis based upon historical experience. Volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Income taxes are estimated on an interim basis to reflect the impact of tax reform assumptions and other considerations. The estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at year-end, and such changes may be significant. The effect of these adjustments in


and


was not significant.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

.

Although the Company does not face material risks related to commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.

Foreign Currency

The Company incurs translation gains or losses resulting from the translation of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. For the periods presented, the Company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposures are the Euro, the functional currency of our European operations; the Canadian dollar, the functional currency of our Canadian operations; and the Australian dollar, the functional currency of our Australasian operations. We monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time, we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Canadian and Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, negatively impacted our results for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Canadian and Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro and Mexican peso, positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2018.

During


and


, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $513 million and $486 million, respectively. A 15% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $770 million in


and $729 million in


. A 20% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $1,026 million in


and $972 million in


.

Interest Rates

The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Based on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by $5.5 million in


and $12 million in 2018. However, these increases in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increases in interest income related to higher interest rates.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019. See below for discussion of our related critical audit matter.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.







How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls over the Company’s process for estimating loss contingencies related to product liabilities. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above and the reconciliation of claims data to that used by the Company’s actuarial specialist.

To test the estimated loss contingencies related to product liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodology used, testing the significant assumptions, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, and comparing significant assumptions to historical claims as well as external data. We evaluated the legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel, held discussions with legal counsel, and performed a search for new or contrary evidence affecting the estimate. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodology and assumptions used by management and to independently develop a range of estimated product liabilities using the Company’s historical data as well as other information available for similar cases. We compared the Company's estimated loss contingencies related to product liabilities to the range developed by our actuarial specialists. We also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures, included in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, in relation to these matters.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Genuine Parts Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries (the "Company") is a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts and materials and business products. The Company serves a diverse customer base through approximately

3,600

locations in North America, Australasia and Europe and, therefore, has limited exposure from credit losses to any particular customer, region, or industry segment. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is not material to the Company’s consolidated net income. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the differences could be material.

Revenue Recognition

The Company applied ASU 2014-09, using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. The cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 and its amendments resulted in a reduction to the opening retained earnings balance of

$

8,000

prior to the tax adjustment, at January 1, 2018 and a related adjustment to other current liabilities as of that date. Revenue for periods prior to January 1, 2018 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition (ASC 605)

.

The Company primarily recognizes revenue at the point the customer obtains control of the products or services and at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those products or services. Contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and recognizes revenue upon delivery or as services are rendered.

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, variable consideration and any taxes collected from customers that will be remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue recognized over time is not significant. Payment terms with customers vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of significant financing components based on the expectation that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant. Liabilities for customer incentives, discounts, or rebates are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Product Distribution Revenues

The Company generates revenue primarily by distributing products through wholesale and retail channels. For wholesale customers, revenue is recognized when title and control of the goods has passed to the customer. Retail revenue is recognized at the point of sale when the goods are transferred to customers and consideration is received. Shipping and handling activities are performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the products. Costs associated with shipping and handling are considered costs to fulfill a contract and are included in selling, administrative and other expenses in the period they are incurred.

Other Revenues

The Company offers software support, product cataloging, marketing, training and other membership program and support services to certain customers. This revenue is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from these services is recognized over a short duration and the impact to our consolidated financial statements is not significant.



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Variable Consideration

The Company’s products are generally sold with a right of return and may include variable consideration in the form of incentives, discounts, credits or rebates. The Company estimates variable consideration based on historical experience to determine the expected amount to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes estimated variable consideration as an adjustment to the transaction price when control of the related product or service is transferred. The realization of variable consideration occurs within a short period of time from product delivery; therefore, the time value of money effect is not significant.

Foreign Currency Translation

The consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and comprehensive income of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at the current and average exchange rates, respectively. The foreign currency translation adjustment is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Trade Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


, and


, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately

$

14,905

,

$

17,147

, and

$

13,932

, respectively. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately

$

37,905

and

$

21,888

, respectively.

Merchandise Inventories, Including Consideration Received From Vendors

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for a majority of U.S. automotive and industrial parts, and generally by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method for business products and certain non-U.S. and other inventories. If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories, cost would have been approximately

$

531,800

and

$

479,500

higher than reported at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. During 2019 and 2017, reductions in industrial parts inventories resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers, which reduced cost of goods sold by approximately

$

10,400

and

$

2,000

, respectively. There were

no

LIFO liquidations in 2018.

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.

The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in


and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of amounts due from vendors, prepaid expenses, and income and other taxes receivable.



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Goodwill

The Company reviews its goodwill annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or a level below an operating segment (a component). A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information and operating results are available and management regularly reviews that information. However, the Company may aggregate two or more components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.

To review goodwill at a reporting unit for impairment, the Company generally elects to first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include adverse macroeconomic, industry or market conditions, cost factors, or financial performance. If the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment or concludes from its assessment of qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company must perform a quantitative test to evaluate goodwill impairment.

To perform a quantitative test, the Company calculates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that amount to the reporting unit's carrying value. The Company typically calculates the fair value by using a combination of a market approach and an income approach that is based on a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used in the market approach generally include benchmark company market multiples and the assumptions used in the income approach generally include the projected cash flows of the reporting unit, which are based on projected revenue growth rates and operating margins, and the estimated weighted average costs of capital, working capital and terminal value. The Company uses inputs and assumptions it believes are consistent with those a hypothetical marketplace participants would use. The Company recognizes goodwill impairment (if any) as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote for further information on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing.

Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill

The Company assesses its long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. To analyze recoverability, the Company projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recognized, resulting in a write-down of assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. Impairment losses, if any, are measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized long-lived asset impairments of

$

7,792

related to certain assets expected to be abandoned in connection with the 2019 Cost Savings Plan (refer to the restructuring footnote for more information). The Company also assessed the finite-lived, identifiable tangible and intangible assets at the Business Products reporting unit for impairment under the undiscounted cash flows approach and concluded there was no impairment.

No

impairments were recognized in


or


.

Other Assets

Other assets consist primarily of cash surrender value of life insurance policies, equity method investments, guarantee fees receivable, and deferred compensation benefits.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are primarily determined on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of each asset: buildings and improvements,


to


years; machinery and equipment,


to


years.

Other Current Liabilities

Other current liabilities consist primarily of reserves for sales returns expected within the next year, accrued compensation, accrued customer incentives, accrued income and other taxes, and other reserves for expenses incurred.

Other Long-term Liabilities

Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of reserves for sales returns expected after the next year, guarantee obligations, accrued taxes and other non-current obligations.



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for the majority its group health insurance costs. A reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the Company’s claims administrators. These reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year.

Long-term insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the Company's workers’ compensation program. In addition, the Company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities. The Company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary. The analysis calculates development factors, which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program. While the Company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

The following table presents the amounts that comprise accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") as well as the changes in those amounts by component for the years ended on

December 31, 2019

and


:

The accumulated other comprehensive loss components related to the pension benefits are included in the computation of net periodic benefit income in the employee benefit plans footnote. The components related to the cash flow and net investment hedges are included in the derivatives and hedging footnote.

Business Combinations

When the Company acquires businesses, it applies the acquisition method of accounting and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, which requires significant estimates and assumptions. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method requires the Company to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period. The Company must complete the accounting during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year. Adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company typically measures customer relationship and other intangible assets using an income approach. Significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

flows expected to be generated from the asset (e.g., future revenue growth rates, operating margins and attrition rates). If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, the Company could record impairment charges. In addition, the Company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If the Company's estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.

Legal and Product Liabilities

The Company accrues for potential losses related to legal disputes, litigation, product liabilities, and regulatory matters when it is probable (more likely than not) that the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

The amount of the product liability reflects the Company’s reasonable estimate of losses based upon currently known facts. To calculate the liability, the Company estimates potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional, similar claims being filed against the Company in the future. To estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future, the Company considers claims pending against the Company, claim filing rates, the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements, and the amount of loss by claim type. The estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using risk-free interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities. The Company uses an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring its product liabilities.

Fair Value Measurements

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, and borrowings under the line of credit and term loan approximate their respective fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the fair value of fixed rate debt was approximately

$

2,013,542

and

$

1,427,381

, respectively. The fair value of fixed rate debt is designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., significant observable inputs) and is based primarily on the discounted value of future cash flows using current market interest rates offered for debt of similar credit risk and maturity. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying value of fixed rate debt, net of debt issuance costs, was

$

1,945,387

and

$

1,466,803

, respectively, and is included in long-term and short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. They are valued using inputs other than quoted prices, such as foreign exchange rates and yield curves.

Fair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analyses of goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets. These involve fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability).

Derivatives and Hedging

The Company is exposed to various risks arising from business operations and market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates and certain foreign currencies. When deemed appropriate, the Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The objective of using these tools is to reduce fluctuations in the Company’s earnings, cash flows and net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries associated with changes in these rates. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company has not historically incurred, and does not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default related to derivative instruments.

The Company formally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow to be paid. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivative and non-derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. When a designated instrument is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

Accounting for Legal Costs

The Company’s legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as such costs are incurred.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company maintains various long-term incentive plans, which provide for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based awards. SARs represent a right to receive upon exercise an amount, payable in shares of common stock, equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise over the base value of the grant. The terms of such SARs require net settlement in shares of common stock and do not provide for cash settlement. RSUs represent a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock at a future date. The majority of awards previously granted vest on a pro-rata basis for periods ranging from

one

to

five years

and are expensed accordingly on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The Company issues new shares upon exercise or conversion of awards under these plans.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes. In addition, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income, future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent financial operations and tax planning strategies.

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted net income per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and nonvested restricted stock awards options. Options to purchase approximately

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Leases (Topic 842)

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

, which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, including operating leases. Expanded disclosures with additional qualitative and quantitative information are also required. ASU 2016-02 and its amendments were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption was permitted.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its amendments as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and utilized the optional transition method to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840,

Leases

, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed the Company to carryforward its historical assessments of: (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In addition, the Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. The Company elected a policy of not recording leases on its consolidated balance sheets when the leases have a term of 12 months or less and the Company is not reasonably certain to elect



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

an option to purchase the leased asset. The Company recognizes payments on these leases within selling, administrative and other expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company's adoption of the standard resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase retained earnings by

$

4,797

, net of taxes, as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated net income or liquidity. The standard did not have an impact on debt-covenant compliance under the Company's current debt agreements.

Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02,

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

. The ASU permits a company to make a one-time election to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The ASU also requires companies to disclose their accounting policies for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2018-02 was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with an election to adopt early. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 as of January 1, 2019 and recognized an adjustment to increase retained earnings and to adjust accumulated other comprehensive loss by approximately

$

122,526

.

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

. The ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 requires applying a one-step quantitative test and recording the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 as of October 1, 2019 and performed its annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with this standard, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge in 2019 of

$

81,968

related to the Company's Business Products reporting unit.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 220)

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. Among other things, the ASU and its amendments replace the incurred loss impairment model for receivables and certain other financial instruments with a current expected credit loss model. The new model measures impairment based on expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset, considering available information about the collectability of cash flows, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required. ASU 2016-13 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with an option to adopt early. The Company plans to adopt the ASU and its amendments on January 1, 2020. On this date the Company currently expects to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings as a result of the adoption. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 and its amendments is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14,

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

. The updated accounting guidance modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing, adding and clarifying certain disclosures. These provisions must be applied retrospectively. ASU 2018-14 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with an option to adopt early. The adoption of ASU 2018-14 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or disclosures. The Company does not plan to early adopt the standard.

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15,

Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract

. ASU No. 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop internal-use software. These provisions should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. ASU 2018-15 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with an option to adopt early. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or disclosures. The Company does not plan to early adopt the standard

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


by reportable segment, as well as other identifiable intangible assets, are summarized as follows:

The Company completed both qualitative and quantitative goodwill assessments as of October 1, 2019. Due to s

everal factors that

developed in the

fourth

quarter

of

2019, the Company performed an interim impairment test as of

December 31, 2019 for its

Business Products reporting unit and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$

81,968

. As such, total goodwill is net of

$

81,968

of accumulated impairment loss.

The factors that

developed in the

fourth

quarter

of

2019 at the Business Products reporting unit included:

(i) greater uncertainty associated with long-term industry trends and the competitive environment and (ii) fourth quarter results, including segment profitability, that were below management expectations due primarily to a reduction in volume with certain national account customers

. The Company

performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that the full amount of goodwill allocated to the

Business Products reporting unit was impaired. The Company determined that the fair values of its remaining reporting units are in excess of their carrying amounts and there were no other indicators that goodwill was impaired.

Derivatives and Hedging

The following table summarizes the location and carrying amounts of the derivative instruments and the foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, that are designated and qualify as part of hedging relationships:

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate variability in forecasted interest payments on a portion of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt. The interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment. The Company designates the interest rate swaps as qualifying hedging instruments and accounts for them as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses from fair value adjustments on the cash flow hedges are initially classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to interest expense on the dates interest payments are accrued.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has designated certain derivative instruments and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, as hedges of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of the Company's Euro-denominated net investment in a European subsidiary. The Company applies the spot method to assess the hedge effectiveness of the derivative instruments and this assessment for each instrument excludes the initial value related to the difference at contract inception between the foreign exchange spot rate and the forward rate (i.e., the forward points). The initial value of this excluded component is recognized as a reduction to interest expense in a systematic and rational manner over the term of the derivative instrument. All other changes in value for the net investment hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and would only be reclassified to earnings if the European subsidiary were liquidated, or otherwise disposed.

Leased Properties

The Company primarily leases real estate for certain retail stores, distribution centers, office space and land. The Company also leases equipment (primarily vehicles).

Most real estate leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend the lease term from

one

to


years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's discretion. The Company evaluates renewal options at lease inception and on an ongoing basis, and includes renewal options that it is reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities. Lease agreements generally do not require material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

The table below presents the locations of the operating lease assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019:

The depreciable lives of operating lease assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term.

The Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. The Company used incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date.

The reasons for the difference between total tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes are as follows:

(1)

U.S. statutory rates applied to income are as follows: 2019 and 2018 at

21%

, 2017 at

35%

.

(2)

The Company's effective tax rate reflects the net benefit of having operations outside of the U.S. which are taxed at statutory rates different from the U.S. statutory rate, with some income being fully or partially exempt from income taxes due to various operating and financing activities.

(3)

Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted December 22, 2017.

The Company accounts for Global Intangible Low Taxed income in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost.

The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S., various states, and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015 or subject to non-United States income tax examinations for years ended prior to 2013. The Company is currently under audit in the U.S. and some of its foreign jurisdictions. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not possible to estimate the effect, if any, of the amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of

December 31, 2019

and


was approximately

$

24,347

and

$

20,669

, respectively, of which approximately

$

and

$

, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

During the years ended

,


, and


, the Company paid, received refunds, or accrued insignificant amounts of interest and penalties. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

December 31, 2019

As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that it has an outside basis difference in certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$

900,000

, which includes the cumulative undistributed earnings from the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Company continues to be indefinitely reinvested in this outside basis difference. Determining the amount of net unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis difference in these entities is not practicable. This is due to the complexities associated with the calculation to determine residual taxes on the undistributed earnings, including the availability of foreign tax credits, applicability of any additional local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the distribution of these earnings.

9.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s defined benefit pension plans cover employees in the U.S., Canada, and Europe who meet eligibility requirements. The plan covering U.S. employees is noncontributory and the Company implemented a hard freeze for the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2013. No further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of December 31, 2013. The Canadian plan is contributory and benefits are based on career average compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute an amount equal to the minimum required contribution under applicable pension legislation. For the plans in the U.S. and Canada, the Company may increase its contribution above the minimum, if appropriate to its tax and cash position and the plans’ funded position. The European plans are funded in accordance with local regulations.

The Company also sponsors supplemental retirement plans covering employees in the U.S. and Canada. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and supplemental retirement plans.

Several assumptions are used to determine the benefit obligations, plan assets, and net periodic income. The discount rate for the U.S. pension plan is calculated using a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy the projected benefit payments. The bond matching approach reflects the process that would be used to settle the pension obligations. The discount rate for non U.S. plans are set by using Willis Towers Watson's RATE:Link model. For each plan, this approach reflects yields available on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay the plan's benefits when due. The expected return on plan assets is based on a calculated market-related value of plan assets, where gains and losses on plan assets are amortized over a

five

year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. Other non-investment unrecognized gains and losses are amortized in future net income based on a “corridor” approach, where the corridor is equal to

10%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. The unrecognized gains and losses in excess of the corridor criteria are amortized over the average future lifetime or service of plan participants, depending on the plan. These assumptions are updated at each annual measurement date.

The Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the funds. The plans in Europe are unfunded and, therefore, there are no plan assets. The pension plan strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada as well as fiduciary standards. The long-term primary investment objectives for the pension plans are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power, and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long-term rates of return.

, by asset category, are shown in the tables below. Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s pension plan assets. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. Level 1 represents observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 represents other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.). Level 3 represents significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). Certain investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value ("NAV") per share as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded on the last day of the calendar plan year. Debt securities including corporate bonds, U.S. Government securities, and asset-backed securities are valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for an investment as of the last day of the calendar plan year.

Guarantees

The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). Presently, the independents are generally consolidated by unaffiliated enterprises that have a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the independent. The Company has no voting interest or other equity conversion rights in any of the independents. The Company does not control the independents or the affiliates, but receives a fee for the guarantee. The Company has concluded that the independents are variable interest entities, but that the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Specifically, the equity holders of the independents have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance including, but not limited to, decisions about hiring and terminating personnel, local marketing and promotional initiatives, pricing and selling activities, credit decisions, monitoring and maintaining appropriate inventories, and store hours. Separately, the Company concluded the affiliates are not variable interest entities. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee. While such borrowings of the independents and affiliates are outstanding, the Company is required to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

At

December 31, 2019

, the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the Company were approximately

$

904,662

. These loans generally mature over periods from

one

to

six years

. In the event that the Company is required to make payments in connection with guaranteed obligations of the independents or the affiliates, the Company would obtain and liquidate certain collateral (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory) to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee. When it is deemed probable that the Company will incur a loss in connection with a guarantee, a liability is recorded equal to this estimated loss. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings.

The Company has recognized certain assets and liabilities amounting to

$

90,000

and

$

78,000

for the guarantees related to the independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. These assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Matters

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, many involving routine litigation incidental to the businesses, including approximately

1,615

pending product liability lawsuits resulting from its national distribution of automotive parts and supplies. Many of these involve claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by the Company.



Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2019

The amounts accrued for product liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were

$

146,230

and

$

141,203

, respectively. While litigation of any type contains an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that its insurance coverage and its defense, and ultimate resolution of pending and reasonably anticipated claims will continue to occur within the ordinary course of the Company’s business and that resolution of these claims will not have a material effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

On April 17, 2017, a jury awarded damages against the Company of

$

81,500

in a litigated automotive product liability dispute.

Through post-trial motions and offsets from previous settlements, the initial verdict was reduced to

$

77,100

. The Company believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or the law and was contrary to the Company’s role in the automotive parts industry.  The Company challenged the verdict through an appeal to a higher court. On February 19, 2020, the higher court issued an order entirely reversing the jury’s finding on damages and ordering a new trial on damages.  Absent any further appeal, the matter will be remanded to the trial court for a new trial on damages only. At the time of the filing of these financial statements, based upon the Company’s legal defenses, insurance coverage, and reserves, the Company does not believe this matter will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Fire at S.P. Richards Headquarters and Distribution Center

On July 19, 2019, a fire occurred at the S.P. Richards headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The building primarily held the S.P. Richards headquarters office and was connected to its Atlanta distribution center. The Company maintains property and casualty loss insurance coverage. The Company expects to recover all losses on inventory, property, plant and equipment and other fire-related costs from insurance proceeds.

%

acquisition, the Company accounted for its


%

investment in Inenco under the equity method of accounting. Upon acquisition the Company recognized the


%

investment at its acquisition-date fair value of

$

123,385

. The difference between the acquisition-date fair value and the carrying amount of the equity method investment resulted in the recognition of a gain of

$

38,663

on the acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value was determined using a market and income approach with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. The gain is included in the line item "other" within non-operating (income) expenses on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Restructuring

In October of 2019, the Company approved and began to implement certain restructuring actions (the "2019 Cost Savings Plan") across its subsidiaries primarily targeted at simplifying organizational structures and distribution networks. The Company believes these actions will reduce costs in the future and allow it to more effectively and efficiently manage its businesses. Among other things, the 2019 Cost Savings Plan will result in workforce reductions and facility closures and consolidations. The Company executed a VRP for its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with this plan.

The table below summarizes costs associated with the 2019 Cost Savings Plan:

The 2019 Cost Savings Plan was approved and funded by the Company's corporate office and therefore these costs are not allocated to the Company's segments. See the segment data footnote for more information.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Genuine Parts Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company’s published consolidated financial statements. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

i. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

iii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired Hennig Fahrzeugteile Group ("Hennig"), PartsPoint Group, Axis New England, Axis New York and Inenco Group Pty Ltd (“Inenco”) and have included their balances as of December 31, 2019 in our consolidated balance sheet and the results of their operations in our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we elected to exclude these acquisitions, which constituted approximately 7.9% of total assets as of December 31, 2019 and 3.2% and 1.1% of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. Our integration of the systems and processes of these businesses could cause changes to our internal controls over financial reporting in future periods.

The Company’s management, including our CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) ("COSO") in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Remediation of previously identified material weakness

As previously disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we identified a material weakness in Alliance Automotive Group's ("AAG") internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, AAG did not adequately identify, design and maintain internal controls at the transaction level that mitigated the risk of material misstatement in financial reporting processes nor did it maintain appropriate information technology controls. During 2019, management implemented a previously disclosed remediation plan that included initiation of compensating controls and enhanced and revised design of existing financial reporting controls, information technology applications and procedures at AAG. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed testing the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2019.



Changes in internal control over financial reporting

Other than with respect to the remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter ended

December 31, 2019

that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Hennig Fahrzeugteile Group ("Hennig"), PartsPoint Group, Axis New England, Axis New York and Inenco Group Pty Ltd (“Inenco”), which are included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted collectively 7.9% of total assets  as of December 31, 2019 and 3.2% and 1.1% of net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hennig, PartsPoint Group, Axis New England, Axis New York and Inenco.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis of Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
