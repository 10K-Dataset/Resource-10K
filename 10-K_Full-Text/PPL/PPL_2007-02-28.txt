PPL
        EnergyPlus markets or brokers the electricity produced by PPL Generation
        subsidiaries, along with purchased power, natural gas and oil, in competitive
        wholesale and deregulated retail markets in order to take advantage of
        opportunities in the competitive energy marketplace.

PPL
        EnergyPlus buys and sells energy at competitive prices. PPL EnergyPlus purchases
        electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level, and also sells electric
        capacity and energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs.
        PPL
        EnergyPlus enters into these agreements to market available energy and capacity
        from PPL Generation's assets and to profit from market price fluctuations.
        PPL
        EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios to maximize the value of PPL's
        generating assets and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. PPL EnergyPlus
        also purchases and sells energy forward and futures contracts as well as
        other
        commodity-based financial instruments in accordance with PPL's risk management
        policies, objectives and strategies.

PPL
        EnergyPlus has executed contracts to provide electricity to PPL Electric
        sufficient for it to meet its PLR obligation through 2009, at the predetermined
        capped rates PPL Electric is entitled to charge its customers during this
        period. This arrangement with PPL Electric accounted for 32% of PPL Energy
        Supply's operating revenues in 2006. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements
        for
        more information concerning these contracts.

PPL
        EnergyPlus currently is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers

Pennsylvania
                  Delivery Segment -

Includes
                  the regulated electric and gas delivery operations of PPL Electric
                  and PPL
                  Gas Utilities.

PPL
                  Electric

PPL
        Electric provides electricity delivery service to approximately 1.4 million
        customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and
        central Pennsylvania. The largest cities in this territory are Allentown,
        Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Hazleton, Lancaster, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and
        Williamsport.

In
        addition to providing electricity delivery service in its service territory
        in
        Pennsylvania, PPL Electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers
        in that territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. As part of the
        PUC
        Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to provide this electricity supply at
        predetermined capped rates through 2009. PPL Electric has executed two contracts
        to purchase electricity from PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to
        meet
        its PLR obligation through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates. PPL
        Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant
        to
        rules that have not yet been promulgated. In February 2007, the PUC issued
        proposed PLR regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation
        and
        implementation of those regulations. The PUC is requesting public comment
        on
        both the regulations and policy statement.

Refer
        to
        "Power Supply" for additional information, as well as Notes 15 and 16 to
        the
        Financial Statements.

During
        2006, about 95% of PPL Electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated
        electricity delivery and supply as a PLR. About 5% of 2006 operating revenues
        were from wholesale sales, primarily the sale to PPL EnergyPlus of power
        purchased from NUGs. During 2006, about 42% of electricity delivery and PLR
        revenues were from residential customers, 37% from commercial customers,
        20%
        from industrial customers and 1% from other customer classes.

PPL
        Electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of PJM, which operates
        the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-Atlantic
        and Midwest regions of the U.S. Bulk electricity is transmitted to wholesale
        users throughout a geographic area including all or part of Delaware, Illinois,
        Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,
        Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
        As of January 1, 2006, PPL Electric became a member of the RFC. The purpose
        of
        the RFC is to preserve and enhance electric service reliability and security
        for
        the interconnected electric systems within its territory and to be a regional
        entity under the framework of the North America Electric Reliability Council
        (NERC). The RFC's key functions are the development of regional standards
        for
        reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and
        non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both NERC and
        regional standards.

PJM
        serves as a FERC-approved RTO in order to accommodate greater competition
        and
        broader participation in the region. An RTO, like an ISO, is a designation
        provided by the FERC to a FERC-approved independent entity that operates
        the
        transmission system and typically administers a competitive power market.
        A
        primary purpose of the RTO/ISO is to separate the operation of, and access
        to,
        the transmission grid from PJM electric utilities' generation interests.
        PJM
        also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.
        Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets, but the RTO/ISO
        directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. PPL Electric
        fully recovers from retail customers the charges that it pays to PJM for
        transmission-related services. PJM imposes these charges pursuant to its
        FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff.

PPL
        Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain
        of
        its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal
        Power Act.

PPL
        Electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional,
        state
        and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental
        matters. Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the Occupational
        Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.

In
        November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards
        legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as PPL
        Electric, and electric generation suppliers serving retail load to provide
        18%
        of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from alternative
        sources within 15 years (by 2020). Under this new state legislation, alternative
        sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel
        cells.
        An electric distribution company will pay an alternative compliance payment
        of
        $45 for each MWh that it is short of its required alternative energy supply
        percentage. Since PPL Electric's PLR generation rates are capped through
        2009 as
        described above and the legislation allows for a cost recovery exemption
        period,
        PPL Electric will not be subject to the requirements of this legislation
        until
        2010. In that year, PPL Electric will have to supply about 9% of the total
        amount of electricity it delivers to its PLR customers from alternative energy
        sources. At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the impact of this
        legislation on its future results of operations because the impact will depend
        on a number of factors that will not be known until 2010, including customer
        load requirements, PLR contract terms and available alternative energy sources
        in the market.

In
        February 2007, Pennsylvania Governor Rendell announced an Energy Independence
        Strategy (Strategy). The Strategy encourages development of energy conservation,
        energy management and alternative energy resources and proposes the creation
        of
        an $850 million Energy Independence Fund (Fund) to support these policy
        objectives through rebates, grants and loans to qualifying programs. The
        Fund
        would be raised with revenue bonds and financed through a non-bypassable
        charge
        on retail electric bills. The Strategy also contains three initiatives to
        address PLR issues. Retail customers could elect to phase-in over three years
        any rate increase approved by the PUC. Also, PLR providers would be required
        to
        obtain a "least cost portfolio" of supply by purchasing power in the spot
        market
        and through contracts of varying lengths and the provider would be required
        to
        procure energy conservation resources before acquiring additional power.
        In
        addition, PLR providers could enter into long-term contracts with large energy
        users and alternative energy developers. The Rendell Administration has released
        draft legislative language to implement the Strategy, which is currently
        under
        review by PPL. The announcement of this Strategy and the draft legislation
        is
        the first step in an expected long legislative process involving all of the
        affected stakeholders. Moreover, it is expected that the implementation details
        of the Strategy, including the issues of deferral of costs and recovery of
        interest for the customer rate phase-in program and the timing of PUC approval
        for PLR supply portfolios, will be delegated to the PUC. At this time, PPL
        cannot predict the final outcome of this legislative and regulatory process
        or
        its ultimate impact.

PPL
                  Gas Utilities

PPL
        Gas
        Utilities was formed in 1946, and PPL acquired the company in 1998. PPL Gas
        Utilities operates a natural gas distribution and propane business in portions
        of various counties in Pennsylvania, as well as in a small area of Maryland
        and
        Delaware, providing natural gas and propane services to approximately 110,000
        customers. PPL Gas Utilities provides its natural gas services in Pennsylvania
        subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC. PPL Gas Utilities also
        provides intrastate and interstate natural gas storage service from storage
        fields in Pennsylvania. The intrastate storage service is regulated by the
        PUC
        and the interstate storage service is regulated by the FERC. However, under
        a
        1992 FERC Order, rates for interstate storage services are the rates set
        by the
        PUC for intrastate service. The propane delivery service is not subject to
        the
        regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC or the FERC.

International
                  Delivery Segment -

Includes
                  regulated electricity distribution companies in the U.K. and Latin
                  America.

PPL
        Global provides electricity delivery service to approximately 3.7 million
        customers in the U.K. and Latin America.

In
        the
        U.K., WPD, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates two electric
        distribution companies that together serve approximately 2.6 million
        end-users.

PPL
        Global also has controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution
        companies serving customers in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia. Emel, of which
        PPL Global owns 95.4%, serves approximately 575,000 customers through subsidiary
        distribution companies in northern Chile and just south of its headquarters
        in
        Santiago, Chile. DelSur, of which PPL Global owns 86.4%, is an electric
        distribution company headquartered in San Salvador, which serves approximately
        290,000 customers in the central and southern regions of El Salvador, including
        a portion of the city of San Salvador. Elfec, of which PPL Global owns 92.1%,
        is
        the second largest electric distribution company in Bolivia, and serves
        approximately 281,000 customers in the Cochabamba region. In the recent past,
        Bolivia has experienced political and social unrest. At this time, PPL is
        unable
        to predict the potential effect on its Bolivian operations.

Seasonality

Demand
        for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather. As a result,
        PPL's
        overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a
        seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat
        waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern
        of
        this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the
        facilities PPL owns and the terms of the contracts to purchase or sell
        electricity.

FINANCIAL
        CONDITION

See
        PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion
        and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this
        information.

CAPITAL
        EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

See
        "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in PPL's, PPL Energy
        Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
        of
        Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning
        estimated capital expenditure requirements for the years 2007-2011. See Note
        to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning expected
        capital expenditures for environmental matters.

COMPETITION

The
        unregulated businesses and markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate
        are highly competitive. The U.S. electric industry has experienced an increase
        in the level of competition in the energy markets due to federal and state
        deregulation initiatives. For instance, in 1992, the Energy Act amended the
        Federal Power Act to provide open access to electric transmission systems
        for
        wholesale transactions. In 1996, the Customer Choice Act was enacted in
        Pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry in order
        to
        create retail access to a competitive market for the generation of electricity.
        Certain other states in which PPL's subsidiaries operate have also adopted
        "customer choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier.
        PPL and its subsidiaries believe that competition in deregulated energy markets
        will continue to be intense. In "Item 1A. Risk Factors," see

"We
        face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
        affect our ability to operate profitably,"

and

"If
        the present trend towards competitive markets is reversed, discontinued or
        delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially
        adversely affected"

for more
        information concerning the risks PPL faces with respect to competition in
        the
        deregulated energy markets.

Pursuant
        to PPL Electric's authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
        the
        PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service
        area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its distribution
        business. Although the majority of PPL Global's international electricity
        transmission and distribution companies operate in non-exclusive concession
        areas in their respective countries, these companies currently face little
        or no
        competition with respect to residential customers. See "Franchises and Licenses"
        for more information.

        the
        operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised
        periodically to reflect changed circumstances.

This
        generation represented a 4% decrease below the output for 2005 due to milder
        weather in the eastern U.S. and the sale of PPL's ownership interest in the
        Griffith plant, as well as planned and unplanned plant outages. Of this
        generation, 57% of the energy was generated by coal-fired stations, 30% from
        nuclear operations at the Susquehanna station, 9% from hydroelectric stations
        and 4% from oil/gas-fired stations.

PPL
        estimates that, on average, approximately 89% of its expected annual generation
        output for the period 2007 through 2009 will be used to meet:

·

PPL
                  EnergyPlus' obligation under two contracts to provide electricity
                  for PPL
                  Electric to satisfy its PLR obligation under the Customer Choice
                  Act
                  through 2009;

·

PPL
                  EnergyPlus' obligation under contracts to provide electricity to
                  NorthWestern through June 2007 and from July 2007 through June
                  2014;
                  and

·

other
                  contractual sales to other counterparties for terms of various
                  lengths.

PPL
        has
        started to and will continue to enter into new power sales contracts over
        the
        next few years to obtain firm commitments for a portion of the output of
        its
        generating facilities, in advance of the expiration of the PLR contracts.
        PPL
        has already entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for
        the
        years 2010 and later.

PPL's
        strategy for 2007 is to obtain commitments for 30 to 50 percent of its 2010
        baseload generation output in the PJM. PPL has already obtained commitments
        at
        the lower end of this range.

Based on the way in which the
        wholesale markets have developed over the last several years, PPL expects
        that
        these new contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter duration than
        the
        PLR contracts, which at inception had terms of approximately nine
        years.

See
        Note
        15 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding PPL's wholesale
        energy commitments and Note 16 for more information regarding the PLR contracts.
        These contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are an integral part
        of,
        PPL's strategy for its energy supply business, which includes the matching
        of
        PPL's anticipated energy supply (including PPL's generation as well as purchase
        commitments) with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths
        with creditworthy counterparties, to capture profits while effectively managing
        PPL's exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit
        risk.

FUEL
        SUPPLY

Coal

Pennsylvania

PPL
        Coal
        Supply provides coal to Iris Energy LLC for the production of synthetic fuel.
        In
        2006, synthetic fuel from Iris Energy provided 55% of the fuel requirements
        for
        three Pennsylvania power plants operated by PPL Generation. The contract
        to
        provide coal to Iris Energy terminates at the end of 2007. At the termination
        of
        this contract, PPL has the option to purchase Iris Energy's membership interest
        in PPL Coal Supply for fair market value, which is expected to be $7 million.
        Coal supply costs are expected to increase by $20 million in 2008 as a result
        of
        the contract ending.

PPL
        Coal
        Supply provides the balance of the Pennsylvania plants' coal requirements.
        PPL
        Coal Supply actively manages its supply base by purchasing coal principally
        from
        mines located in central Appalachia and western and central
        Pennsylvania.

During
        2006, PPL Coal Supply purchased about 95% of the coal delivered to PPL
        Generation's wholly owned Pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term
        contracts and obtained 5% through spot market purchases. These contracts
        provided PPL Coal Supply with about 7.7 million tons of coal. Contracts
        currently in place are expected to provide approximately 7.4 million tons
        in
        2007. At December 31, 2006, the wholly owned Pennsylvania plants had sufficient
        supply for about 39 days of operations. The amount of coal in inventory varies
        from time to time depending on market conditions and plant
        operations.

During
        the third quarter of 2006, PPL entered into a long-term coal purchase agreement
        with CONSOL Energy Inc. The contract will provide more than one-third of
        PPL's
        projected coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants for 2008 through
        2018.

Also
        at
        December 31, 2006, a PPL Generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in
        the
        Keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station. The owners
        of
        the Keystone station have a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel supplier.
        This contract provided 4.4 million tons in 2006 and is projected to provide
        4.5
        million tons in 2007. This contract terminates at the end of 2007. The Keystone
        station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for the balance of its requirements.
        The owners of the Conemaugh station also have a long-term contract with a
        synthetic fuel supplier. This contract provided 2.4 million tons in 2006
        and is
        projected to provide a minimum of 2.4 million tons in 2007. This contract
        terminates at the end of 2007. The balance of the Conemaugh station requirements
        is purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC. PPL's share of Keystone
        and Conemaugh coal supply costs are expected to increase by $4 million in
        as a result of the synthetic fuel contract ending.

Montana

PPL
        Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30%
        leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3. PPL Montana is party to contracts
        to
        purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined quality characteristics
        and
        specifications. The coal supply contract for Units 1 and 2 is in effect through
        December 31, 2009. The coal supply contract for Unit 3 is in effect through
        December 31, 2019.

Coal
        supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality
        characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette station. The
        contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements in 2006. Similar
        contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of the expected coal
        requirements through 2008.

Oil
        and Natural Gas

PPL
        Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. PPL
        EnergyPlus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural gas supply for
        all
        PPL Generation operations. During 2006, 100% of the physical oil and gas
        requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased on the spot market.
        As
        of December 31, 2006, PPL EnergyPlus had no long-term agreements for these
        oil
        requirements.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements
        to
        purchase natural gas for University Park.

PPL
        EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected
        pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility, but has
        no
        long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas.

PPL
        EnergyPlus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in
        place
        for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt.
        Bethel
        facility, but has no long-term supply agreement to purchase natural
        gas.

Nuclear

The
        nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the
        mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the
        conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component;
        the
        enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for
        insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final
        disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

PPL
        Susquehanna has in effect a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying
        expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. These contracts
        are
        expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the
        first
        quarter of 2012 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2011. PPL
        Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued
        operation of the nuclear units.

Federal
        law requires the federal government to provide for the permanent disposal
        of
        commercial spent nuclear fuel. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA),
        the
        DOE initiated an analysis of a site in Nevada for a permanent nuclear waste
        repository. There is no definitive date by which this repository will be
        operational. As a result, it was necessary to expand Susquehanna's on-site
        spent
        fuel storage capacity. To support this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted
        for
        the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry
        cask
        fuel storage technology. The facility is modular, so that additional storage
        capacity can be added as needed. The facility began receiving spent nuclear
        fuel
        in 1999. PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity
        in
        the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility
        at
        Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017,
        under current operating conditions. If necessary, the on-site spent fuel
        storage
        facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are
        obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry
        fuel
        storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be
        discharged through the current licensed life of the plant.

In
        2002,
        President Bush approved the Congressional override of a veto by the State
        of
        Nevada, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the site for development of
        a
        permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste. The next step is for
        the
        DOE to submit a license application to the NRC to build and then operate
        the
        Yucca Mountain repository. The DOE has not announced a date when that license
        application will be submitted.

In
        1996,
        the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that
        the
        NWPA imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent
        nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998. In 1997, the Court ruled that
        the
        contracts between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially adequate
        remedy if the DOE failed to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel by January
        31,
        1998. The DOE did not, in fact, begin to dispose of spent nuclear fuel on
        that
        date. The DOE continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted
        in recoverable damages. In January 2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the
        U.S.
        Court of Federal Claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the
        DOE's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.
        PPL
        cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

ENVIRONMENTAL
        MATTERS

Certain
        PPL subsidiaries, including PPL Electric and PPL Generation subsidiaries,
        are
        subject to certain present and developing federal, regional, state and local
        laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and
        other
        environmental matters. See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial Condition
        -
        Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and
        Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information
        concerning environmental expenditures during 2006 and their estimate of those
        expenditures during the years 2007-2011. Certain environmental laws, regulations
        and developments that may have a substantial impact on PPL are discussed
        below.
        See "Environmental Matters" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
        information regarding these laws and regulations and the status of PPL's
        and its
        subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as legal and
        regulatory proceedings, involving PPL and its subsidiaries.

Air

The
        Clean
        Air Act includes, among other things, provisions that: (a) restrict the
        construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and substantially
        modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b) authorize
        the EPA
        to impose substantial noncompliance penalties per day of violation for each
        facility found to be in violation of the requirements of an applicable state
        implementation plan. The state agencies administer the EPA's air quality
        regulations through the state implementation plans and have concurrent authority
        to impose penalties for non-compliance.

In
        2005,
        the EPA finalized its Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) requiring substantial
        reductions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions in 28 midwestern
        and
        eastern states, including Pennsylvania. Pursuant to a separate rule finalized
        in
        2005, the EPA is requiring mercury reductions nationwide. Montana has already
        finalized, and Pennsylvania is close to finalizing, mercury regulations more
        stringent than the federal rule. Pennsylvania is also considering an initiative
        by the Ozone Transport Commission that would be more stringent than the CAIR.
        In
        addition, there is mounting pressure from various states and environmental
        groups and at the federal level for mandatory carbon dioxide reductions.
        For
        example, several states have already passed legislation capping carbon emissions
        and bills have been introduced at the federal level proposing mandatory
        reductions. Also in 2005, seven northeast states (excluding Pennsylvania)
        signed
        a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a mandatory cap and trade program
        to
        stabilize and then reduce carbon dioxide emissions from their electric
        generating plants. It is not yet clear whether this program or a similar
        program
        will be extended to or adopted by Pennsylvania.

Water

To
        implement the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of
        1972,
        as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,
        the
        EPA has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric stations.
        The states administer the EPA's effluent standards through state laws and
        regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges and water
        quality. The standards adopted by the EPA pursuant to the Clean Water Act
        may
        have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain PPL subsidiaries,
        depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments to regulations.
        The EPA has decided to study the steam electric industry for two years to
        determine if new effluent standards are needed for that industrial
        category.

Pursuant
        to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977, the OSM has adopted effluent
        guidelines which are applicable to PPL subsidiaries as a result of their
        past
        coal mining and coal processing activities. The EPA and the OSM limitations,
        guidelines and standards also are enforced through the issuance of NPDES
        permits. In accordance with the provisions of the Clean Water Act and the
        Reclamation Act of 1977, the EPA and the OSM have authorized the states to
        implement the NPDES program. Compliance with applicable water quality standards
        is assured by state imposition of NPDES permit conditions and requirements
        to
        address acid mine drainage.

Solid
        and Hazardous Waste

The
        provisions of Superfund authorize the EPA to require past and present owners
        of
        contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site
        to
        clean-up the site or pay the EPA or the state for the costs of clean-up.
        The
        generators and past owners can be liable even if the generator contributed
        only
        a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the site. Present owners
        can be
        liable even if they contributed no hazardous substances to the
        site.

State
        laws such as the Pennsylvania and Montana Superfund statutes and the
        Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act also give state agencies broad authority
        to identify contaminated sites or sites with waste that has been improperly
        disposed of, and to order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the sites.
        If responsible parties cannot or will not perform the clean-up, the agency
        can
        hire contractors to clean-up the sites and then require reimbursement from
        the
        responsible parties after the clean-up is completed. Another Pennsylvania
        statute, the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards, encourages
        voluntary clean-ups by allowing responsible parties to choose from a menu
        of
        clean-up standards and providing liability protection commensurate with the
        clean-up standard chosen.

Furthermore,
        the EPA and several states, including Montana, are considering establishing
        regulations that could impact the disposal and management of coal combustion
        products including ash and scrubber wastes and other by-products. PPL cannot
        predict at this time what impact, if any, such regulation would have on the
        operating facilities.

Certain
        federal and state statutes, including federal and state Superfund statutes,
        also
        impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged
        natural resources.

Low-Level
        Radioactive Waste

Under
        federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive
        waste generated in that state. States may join in regional compacts to jointly
        fulfill their responsibilities. The states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware
        and West Virginia are members of the Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive
        Waste Compact. Efforts to develop a regional disposal facility in Pennsylvania
        were suspended by the Pennsylvania DEP in 1998. The Commonwealth retains
        the
        legal authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it
        be
        necessary. Low-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation of the
        Susquehanna facility is currently being sent to Barnwell, South Carolina,
        and
        Clive, Utah, for disposal. In the event these or other emergent disposal
        options
        become unavailable or no longer cost-effective, the low-level radioactive
        waste
        will be stored on-site at Susquehanna. PPL Susquehanna cannot predict the
        future
        availability of low-level waste disposal facilities or the cost of such
        disposal.

Electric
        and Magnetic Fields

Concerns
        have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
        effects of power frequency electric and/or magnetic fields (EMFs), which
        are
        emitted by all devices carrying electricity, including electric transmission
        and
        distribution lines and substation equipment. Government officials in the
        U.S.
        and the U.K. have reviewed this issue.

The
        U.S.
        National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that,
        for
        most health outcomes, there is no evidence of EMFs causing adverse effects.
        The
        agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an
        association with childhood leukemia, but that this evidence is difficult
        to
        interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. The U.K. National Radiological
        Protection Board (now part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded
        in
        2004 that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that
        EMFs
        cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
        existing exposure guidelines.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether EMFs cause
        adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce EMFs,
        where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities.
        PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the EMF
        issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the U.S. or
        abroad, and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might
        incur
        related to the EMF issue.

General

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving
        environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities
        and operations. In complying with statutes, regulations and actions by
        regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of
        water
        and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic
        substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease
        operating certain of their facilities. PPL's subsidiaries may also incur
        significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which
        are not
        now determinable, but could be significant.

FRANCHISES
        AND LICENSES

PPL
        Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout
        its
        service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
        corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded
        and
        as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right
        to
        enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain
        conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution,
        permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political
        subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

See
        "Background - Supply Segment" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses
        in
        various states. PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the DOE to
        sell
        capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.

PPL
        Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating licenses. In
        September 2006, PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for 20-year license renewals
        for each of the Susquehanna units to extend their expiration dates, from
        2022 to
        2042 for Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2. PPL cannot predict whether
        or
        when NRC approval will be obtained.

PPL
        Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant
        to a
        license renewed by the FERC in 1980 and expiring in 2014. PPL Holtwood operates
        the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license
        renewed
        by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044. PPL Holtwood also owns one-third
        of
        the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation (Safe Harbor), which
        holds a project license that extends the operation of its hydroelectric
        generating station until 2030. The total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating
        station is 418 MW, and PPL Holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third
        of the
        total capacity.

The
        hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from Montana
        Power
        in 1999 are licensed by the FERC. These licenses expire periodically, and
        the
        generating facilities must be relicensed at such times. The FERC license
        for the
        Mystic facility expires in 2009; the Thompson Falls and Kerr licenses expire
        in
        2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine Missouri-Madison
        facilities expire in 2040. PPL Montana currently is working to have the Mystic
        facility relicensed, and it filed the final license application for the new
        license in December 2006.

In
        connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, FERC may,
        under
        applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee,
        or
        the U.S. government may take over the facility. If the original licensee
        is not
        relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not
        to
        exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other
        property affected by the lack of relicensing.

PPL
        Global's international electricity transmission and distribution companies
        are
        authorized by the governments of their respective countries to provide electric
        distribution services within their concession areas and service territories,
        subject to certain conditions and obligations. For instance, each of these
        companies is subject to governmental regulation on the prices that it can
        charge
        and the quality of service it must provide, and the companies can be fined
        or
        even have their licenses or concessions revoked if they do not meet the mandated
        quality of service.

WPD
        operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by
        Ofgem.
        The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue is normally
        determined every five years. The most recent review was completed in late-2004,
        and new prices became effective April 1, 2005.

Emel
        is
        subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by Chile's National Energy Commission.
        The components of the distribution tariffs are energy and capacity prices,
        a
        transmission surcharge and the value added on account of distribution costs
        (VAD). The VAD includes a targeted return on invested capital of 10% per year.
        The energy and capacity prices are a direct pass-through to regulated customers
        of the energy charge that Emel pays to the generation companies. The tariffs
        are
        calculated every four years. The most recent tariff review was completed
        and
        revised rates became effective as of November 2004.

DelSur
        is
        subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by El Salvador's General Superintendent
        of Electricity and Telecommunications. The three components of the distribution
        tariff are an energy price, a commercialization charge and a distribution
        charge. DelSur's tariff specifies the energy price as a trailing six-month
        average of the spot market price. The tariffs are calculated every five years
        and are adjusted for inflation on January 1 of each year. The next comprehensive
        tariff review will take place in 2007 and be effective in 2008.

Elfec
        is
        subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by Bolivia's Superintendent of
        Electricity. Tariffs are calculated every four years based on the trailing
        three-year average of the equity returns from companies listed in the Dow
        Jones
        Utility Index. Tariffs are adjusted on a monthly basis for local inflation
        and
        every six months to reflect any changes in the energy node prices, which
        is a
        pass-through to regulated customers of the energy charge that Elfec pays
        to
        generation companies. The tariffs are calculated every four years. The most
        recent ordinary tariff review was completed in January 2004 and new prices
        became effective at that time. An extraordinary tariff review was completed
        in
        November 2006 and new prices became effective at that time. The next ordinary
        tariff review will be completed by January 2008.

Includes
                  union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose number
                  tends
                  to fluctuate due to the nature of this business.

(b)

Includes
                  employees of WPD and PPL Global's consolidated subsidiaries in
                  Latin
                  America.

Approximately
        60%, or 5,252, of PPL's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with
        four IBEW locals representing 3,605 employees. The other unions primarily
        represent employees of the mechanical contractors and gas utility employees
        in
        Pennsylvania. The bargaining agreement with the largest union was negotiated
        in
        May 2006 and expires in May 2010. Eight four-year contracts with smaller
        gas
        utility locals in Pennsylvania were negotiated in 2003. In June 2004, the
        IBEW
        representing 240 employees at the Montana Colstrip power plant approved a
        four-year labor agreement expiring in June 2008. In April 2005, a three-year
        contract expiring in April 2008 was negotiated with an IBEW local in Montana
        that represents 80 employees at the hydroelectric facility and at the Corette
        plant.

Approximately
        78%, or 3,022, of PPL's international workforce are members of labor unions.
        WPD
        employs the majority of the international workforce. WPD recognizes five
        unions,
        the largest of which represents 38% of union members. WPD has two employment
        agreements that are negotiated with the unions. The largest agreement, the
        Electricity Business Agreement, covers 2,033 union employees; it may be amended
        by agreement between WPD and the unions and is terminable with 12 months
        notice
        by either side.

PPL's
        Latin American subsidiaries have 910 union employees that are represented
        by 13
        unions. Emel concluded labor negotiations in 2006, and now has agreements
        in
        place until 2009. DelSur concluded negotiations in January 2007, and the
        new
        agreement is in place until 2010. Annually, Elfec negotiates adjustments
        to its
        compensation and benefits.

ITEM
        1A. RISK FACTORS

PPL,
        PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with their
        businesses. While we have tried to identify below the risks we currently
        consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we face. Additional
        risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may
        also
        impair our business operations. Our businesses, financial condition, cash
        flows
        or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of
        these
        risks. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other
        statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. See
        "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
        and
        Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the risks
        described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could
        impact
        our businesses and financial results.

As
        used
        in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and
        its
        consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its
        consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International
        Delivery segment discussions, or PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities and their
        consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Delivery
        segment discussion.

Risks
        Related to Supply Segment

(

PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply

)

Adverse
        changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy
        margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash
        flows.

Our
        energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power
        exceed our costs of supplying power, are impacted by changes in the market
        prices for electricity, as well as fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel
        transportation costs, emission allowances, renewable energy credits, electricity
        transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. Unlike most
        other
        commodities, there is limited ability to store electric power and it must
        be
        consumed at the time of production. As a result, the wholesale market prices
        for
        electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of
        time
        and can be unpredictable. Among the factors that can influence such prices
        are:

See
        Exhibit 99(b) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in
        wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five
        years.

Whether
        we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power
        sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements in order to mitigate
        market price and supply risk may affect our earnings.

As
        a
        result of the PLR contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion
        of our anticipated generation production is currently committed through 2009
        under power sales agreements of various terms that include fixed prices for
        our
        electric power. In connection with such agreements we have entered into
        longer-term fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements that include
        fixed
        prices. Whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into such
        agreements or renew existing agreements and the market conditions at that
        time
        will affect our financial performance. For instance, in the absence of long-term
        power sales agreements, we would sell the energy, capacity and other products
        from our facilities into the competitive wholesale power markets under contracts
        of shorter duration at then-current market prices.

Although
        the current forward prices for electricity significantly exceed the prices
        available under some of our current power sales agreements, this situation
        may
        not continue. In addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel
        purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our power generation facilities,
        our fuel costs (and the associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed
        the
        revenues that we derive from our energy sales. Given the volatility and
        potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and
        fuel
        and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity sales
        and
        fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be subject
        to
        increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel costs
        (and
        the associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may be
        materially adversely affected.

Disruptions
        in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability
        to
        operate our generation facilities.

We
        purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel,
        including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties,
        labor
        relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel
        suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities,
        which
        could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect
        our
        results of operations.

Our
        generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our
        expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our
        financial performance.

Our
        ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants
        is
        critical to our financial performance. Operation of our power plants at expected
        capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of
        equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel interruption.
        In
        addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt our generation plants.
        Weather conditions also have a direct impact on the river flows required
        to
        operate our hydroelectric plants at expected capacity levels. Depending on
        the
        timing and duration of both planned and unplanned complete or partial outages
        at
        our power plants (in particular, if such outages are during peak periods
        or
        during periods of, or caused by, severe weather), our revenues from energy
        sales
        could be significantly decreased and our expenses significantly increased,
        and
        we could be required to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy
        our energy sales commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages
        for our failure to satisfy them. Many of our generating units are reaching
        mid-life, and we are faced with the potential for more frequent unplanned
        outages and the possibility of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate
        significant investments in major component replacements at these
        facilities.

Changes
        in technology may impair the value of our power
        plants.

A
        basic
        premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants
        achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low
        price.
        There are other technologies for producing electricity, most notably fuel
        cells,
        microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. Research and
        development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in the alternate
        technologies. It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate
        methods of electric production to a level that is equal to or below that
        of most
        central station electric production. Also, as new technologies are developed
        and
        become available, the quantity and the pattern of electricity usage (the
        "demand") by customers could change, thus allowing them to reduce their
        purchases and the corresponding revenues that the generators receive. If
        this
        were to happen, the value of our generation facilities may be significantly
        impaired.

We
        rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control
        to
        deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas. If transmission is disrupted,
        or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to
        sell
        and deliver power may be hindered.

We
        depend
        on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities
        and
        other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell
        to the
        wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric
        generation facilities. If transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather,
        natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by ISOs,
        in
        applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and
        deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered,
        or we
        may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms.

The
        FERC
        has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services
        to
        be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. Although these
        regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
        transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal
        access
        to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission
        capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we desire. We cannot
        predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or
        the
        adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs in
        applicable markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related
        services, efficiently.

The
        PLR contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply, and demand
        significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy
        margins.

PPL
        Electric is obligated to provide electricity supply to its PLR customers
        at
        predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into PUC-approved,
        full
        requirements energy supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at the rates PPL
        Electric is entitled to charge its PLR customers in order to fulfill its
        PLR
        obligation. If PPL Electric's customers obtain electricity from alternate
        suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, PPL EnergyPlus' sales
        of
        electricity under the PLR contracts may decrease.

Alternatively,
        demand that we satisfy pursuant to the PLR contracts could increase as a
        result
        of severe weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over
        which
        we have no control. We satisfy our electricity supply obligations through
        a
        portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets,
        contractual relationships and market purchases.

At
        December 31, 2006, the PLR requirements required about 80% of the normal
        operating capacity of our existing Pennsylvania generation assets

.

A
        significant increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins
        because
        we are required under the terms of the PLR contracts to provide the energy
        supply to fulfill this increased demand at the capped rates, which we expect
        to
        remain significantly below the wholesale prices at which we would have to
        purchase the additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity,
        the
        prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional supply. Accordingly,
        any
        significant increase in demand could have a material adverse effect on our
        results of operations or financial position.

PPL
        Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant
        to
        rules that have not yet been promulgated. While regulations governing PLR
        obligations after 2009 have been proposed for comment by the PUC, at this
        time,
        we cannot predict the content of the final regulations, including whether
        they
        will include requirements regarding the length, pricing or other terms of
        PLR
        contracts, or when the regulations will be finalized. We also cannot predict
        the
        extent to which PPL EnergyPlus will sell power to PPL Electric after
        2009.

We
        face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
        affect our ability to operate profitably.

Unlike
        our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured
        of
        any rate of return on our capital investments through predetermined rates,
        and
        our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our ability to operate
        in a competitive environment. An important focus of our supply business over
        the
        next several years will be the enhancement and expansion of our wholesale
        marketing and trading of electricity and related products and services, but
        we
        may not be successful because of the intense competition that we face in
        the
        deregulated electricity markets. Competition is impacted by electricity and
        fuel
        prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets,
        technological advances in power generation, the actions of regulatory
        authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact
        our ability to sell electricity and related products and services and the
        prices
        which we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely
        affect
        our results of operations and our ability to grow our business.

Following
        the expiration of our existing power sales agreements, we currently expect
        to
        sell our available capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through
        contracts of various duration. Competition in the wholesale power markets
        will
        occur principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser
        extent,
        on the basis of reliability and availability. We expect the commencement
        of
        commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where
        we
        own or control generation capacity will continue to increase the competitiveness
        of the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have a
        material adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity.

We
        also
        face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary
        services. We primarily compete with other electricity merchants based on
        our
        ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources
        and
        to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and
        transmission from electric utilities and ISOs. We also compete against other
        energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access
        to
        credit sources, and many of our competitors have greater financial resources
        than we have.

Competitors
        in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL
        EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies,
        non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities.
        In
        the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other
        investments in the electric utility sector. Entirely new competitors, including
        financial institutions, may enter the energy markets as a result of the repeal
        of PUHCA. The repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our industry,
        resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than
        we
        have.

If
        the present trend towards competitive markets is reversed, discontinued or
        delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially
        adversely affected.

Some
        deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price
        volatility. In some of these markets, state legislators, government agencies
        and
        other interested parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring,
        change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets
        that
        have previously been deregulated or permit electricity delivery companies
        to
        construct or acquire generating facilities. For example, in 2001, the FERC
        instituted a series of price controls designed to mitigate (or cap) prices
        in
        the entire western U.S. to address the extreme volatility in the California
        electricity markets. These price controls have had the effect of significantly
        lowering spot and forward electricity prices in the western market. In addition,
        the independent system operators, or ISOs, that oversee the transmission
        systems
        in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized
        to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in
        the
        power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may
        reduce
        the profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would
        have
        realized based on competitive market conditions absent such limitations and
        mechanisms. Although we generally expect electricity markets to continue
        to be
        competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and
        legislative or other action, affecting the electric power restructuring process
        may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in the states
        in
        which we currently, or may in the future, operate.

We
        are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling
        and
        marketing products in the wholesale electricity
        markets.

We
        purchase and sell electricity at the wholesale level under market-based tariffs
        authorized by the FERC throughout the United States and also enter into
        short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our
        generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price
        fluctuations. If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under
        these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. These damages would
        generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
        replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of the undelivered
        capacity or electricity. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale
        electricity markets, such damages could be significant. Extreme weather
        conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, transmissions disruptions,
        and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause
        significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and
        electricity.

In
        addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us
        to post
        collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy
        varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds. At December 31, 2006,
        we
        posted $228 million of collateral, in the form of letters of credit, under
        these
        contracts. Although we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity
        facilities to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these
        contracts, we have increased our available liquidity facilities to $2.4 billion
        at December 31, 2006, in order to satisfy these collateral obligations
        and to maintain our credit ratings due, in significant part, to the potential
        collateral requirements under these contracts. In addition, we expect to
        increase our available liquidity facilities in 2007 to support contracts
        that we
        expect to enter as we seek to expand our wholesale marketing and trading
        business, including power contracts for the sale of electricity that will
        become
        available following the expiration of our PLR contracts with PPL
        Electric.

We
        also
        face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their
        performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a
        lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed
        at
        the time of contract. We attempt to mitigate these risks through various
        means,
        including through agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral
        for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices
        beyond certain thresholds. However, there can be no assurance that we will
        avoid
        counterparty non-performance. Counterparty non-performance could adversely
        impact our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which
        could
        in turn subject us to claims for damages.

We
        do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price
        volatility.

We
        attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity
        sales arrangements by either reserving generation capacity to deliver
        electricity or purchasing the necessary products and services through the
        competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. We also routinely
        enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale
        commitments, to hedge our exposure to weather conditions, fuel requirements
        and
        other electricity-related commodities. However, based on economic and other
        considerations, we may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from
        commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity
        price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be
        adversely affected.

Our
        risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices,
        interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned,
        and we may suffer economic losses despite such
        programs.

We
        actively manage the market risk inherent in our electricity and fuel, debt,
        foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. We have implemented
        procedures to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management policy
        and
        programs, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification
        of
        risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting
        of various risk measurement metrics. Nonetheless, our risk management programs
        may not work as planned. For instance, actual electricity and fuel prices
        may be
        significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and
        assumptions upon which we based our risk management positions. Similarly,
        interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant
        ways that our risk management procedures were not set up to address. As a
        result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions
        may have on us if actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our
        risk
        management positions were intended to hedge. If our risk management positions
        are ineffective in this way, we could be subject to mark-to-market accounting
        with respect to certain of our risk management contracts, which could lead
        to
        significant volatility in our earnings and our balance sheet.

In
        addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed
        to
        the credit risk that counterparties that owe us money, electricity or fuel
        will
        breach their obligations. We have established a risk management policy and
        programs, including credit risk programs, to evaluate counterparty credit
        risk.
        However, if counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may
        be
        forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.
        In
        that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely
        affected.

Despite
        federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still
        subject
        to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues,
        or
        prevent or delay operation of our facilities.

Our
        U.S.
        generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. Generally,
        our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to
        regulation by the FERC. The FERC has authorized us to sell generation from
        our
        facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.
        The
        FERC retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority
        and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is
        not
        workably competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging
        just and reasonable rates. Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may
        receive
        or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could
        materially adversely affect our results of operations. See "FERC Market-Based
        Rate Authority" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for information regarding
        recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's market-based rate authority
        program.

In
        addition, the acquisition, ownership and operation of electricity generation
        facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates
        from
        federal, state and local governmental agencies. We may not be able to obtain
        or
        maintain all required regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining
        any
        required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required
        approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation
        of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed
        or
        become subject to additional costs.

Our
        planned generation growth plans may not achieve the desired financial
        results.

We
        currently plan to expand our generation capacity over the next several years
        through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential
        construction of new power plants and the potential acquisition of existing
        plants. The acquisition, development and construction of additional generation
        capacity through any of these means involve numerous risks. Any planned power
        uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher
        operating and other costs. With respect to the construction of new plants
        or the
        acquisition of existing plants, we may be required to expend significant
        sums
        for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and
        other
        expenses in preparation for competitive bids that we may not win or before
        it
        can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive
        or
        capable of being financed. The success of both a new project and a
        newly-acquired plant would likely be contingent upon, among other things,
        the
        negotiation of satisfactory fuel supply and power sales contracts. Our success
        in developing a new plant would likely be contingent upon, among other things,
        negotiation of satisfactory engineering and construction contracts, receipt
        of
        required governmental permits and satisfactory completion of construction.
        If we
        were unable to complete the construction of a facility, we would generally
        not
        be able to recover our investment in the project. Furthermore, we may be
        unable
        to run any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could
        result in higher-than-projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings.

Our
        costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to
        continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital
        expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely
        affect our profitability and liquidity.

Our
        business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules
        and
        regulations relating to environmental protection. To comply with existing
        and
        future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution
        control
        measures we may take, we expect to spend substantial amounts in the future
        on
        environmental control and compliance.

As
        a
        result of existing and recently-enacted federal environmental laws and
        regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-burning plants, PPL's
        current installation plan for the scrubbers and other pollution control
        equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate, nitrogen oxides
        and
        mercury emissions reduction) through 2011 reflects a total cost of approximately
        $1.5 billion. Many states and environmental groups have challenged certain
        of
        the federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being
        sufficiently strict. As a result, it is possible that state and federal
        regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations
        on
        emissions than are currently in effect, which could require us to incur
        significantly greater capital expenditures for pollution control equipment.

We
        may
        not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals
        necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary
        to
        our business. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental
        regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any
        such
        approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or subjected
        to
        additional costs. Furthermore, at some of our older facilities it may be
        uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment, which may cause us
        to
        shut down those generation units.

There
        also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide
        and
        other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global warming).
        Various
        legislative proposals are being considered in Congress, and several states
        already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions.

For
        more
        information regarding environmental matters, including the existing and proposed
        federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are
        subject, see "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
        Statements.

We
        are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our
        Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety
        requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures,
        and
        uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its
        licensed life.

Nuclear
        generation accounted for about 30% of our 2006 generation output. The risks
        of
        nuclear generation generally include:

·

the
                  potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting
                  from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling
                  and
                  disposal of radioactive materials;

·

limitations
                  on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to
                  cover
                  losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear
                  operations; and

·

uncertainties
                  with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
                  nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
                  lives.

The
        NRC
        has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as
        well
        as security-related and safety-related requirements for the operation of
        nuclear
        generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority
        to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment
        of
        the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In addition,
        revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate
        substantial capital or operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear
        plant.
        In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident
        at our Susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational
        loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results
        of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Risks
        Related to International Delivery Segment

(

PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply

)

Our
        international delivery businesses are also subject to risks with respect
        to rate
        regulation and operational performance.

Like
        our
        Pennsylvania delivery businesses, our international delivery businesses are
        rate-regulated. In addition, their ability to manage operational risk is
        critical to their financial performance. Accordingly, these businesses are
        subject to the same risks as those described below under "Risks Related to
        Pennsylvania Delivery Segment."

Our
        international delivery businesses expose us to risks related to laws of other
        countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
        rates, political and social conditions and policies of foreign governments.
        These risks may reduce our results of operations from our delivery
        businesses.

The
        acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects outside of
        the
        United States entail significant financial risks, which vary by country,
        including:

Our
        international operations are subject to regulation by various foreign
        governments and regulatory authorities. The laws and regulations of some
        countries may limit our ability to hold a majority interest in some of the
        projects that we may develop or acquire, thus limiting our ability to control
        the development, construction and operation of those projects. In addition,
        the
        legal environment in foreign countries in which we currently own assets or
        projects or may develop projects in the future could make it more difficult
        for
        us to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects. Our
        international projects also may be subject to risks of being delayed, suspended
        or terminated by the applicable foreign governments or may be subject to
        risks
        of contract invalidation by commercial or governmental entities.

Despite
        contractual or other protections we have against many of these risks for
        our
        international operations or potential investments in the future, our actual
        results and the value of our investments may be adversely affected by the
        occurrence of any of these events.

Risks
        Related to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment

(

PPL
        and PPL Electric

)

Regulators
        may not approve the rates we request.

Our
        Pennsylvania delivery businesses are rate-regulated. While such regulation
        is
        generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs, including
        energy
        supply costs for PLR customers, and a reasonable rate of return on invested
        capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are subject
        to
        authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities, and there is no
        guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match our actual costs
        or
        provide a particular return on invested capital at any given time.

Our
        transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which
        may
        increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse
        effect
        on our financial performance.

Our
        ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and
        distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery
        business. Our delivery business also faces several risks, including the
        breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due
        to
        severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes. Operation
        of
        our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenues or
        increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs.

PPL
        Electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able
        to
        obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge
        to
        its PLR customers.

In
        order
        to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply,
        through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates we may charge to our PLR
        customers, we have entered into PUC-approved, full requirements energy supply
        agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at these capped rates. Under one of the PLR
        contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits with PPL
        EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract
        price
        by more than our contract collateral threshold. Conversely, PPL EnergyPlus
        is
        required to make performance assurance deposits with us when the market price
        of
        electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its contract
        collateral threshold. Over the past few years, market prices for electricity
        have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at December 31,
        2006,
        the market price of electricity exceeded the contract price in total by
        approximately $2.2 billion. Accordingly, at December 31, 2006, PPL
        EnergyPlus was required to provide us with performance assurance of $300
        million, the maximum amount of collateral required under the contract. If
        PPL
        EnergyPlus is unable to satisfy its energy supply obligations to us under
        the
        PLR contracts, we would be required to obtain energy supply in the wholesale
        market at then-current market rates to meet our PLR obligation. While the
        Customer Choice Act provides generally for PLR costs to be borne by customers,
        it is not clear whether we would be able to pass on to our customers any
        costs
        of this replacement energy supply that exceed the predetermined capped
        rates.

Our
        PLR
        obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant to rules that
        have
        not yet been promulgated. While regulations governing PLR obligations after
        have been proposed for comment by the PUC, at this time, we cannot predict
        the
        content of the final regulations, including the specific mechanism for recovery
        from customers of our costs for energy supply, or when the regulations will
        be
        finalized. Recognizing the uncertain status of the PLR rules, we have requested
        permission from the PUC to purchase generation supply in 2007 through 2009
        to
        meet our PLR obligation in 2010 and to recover all costs of those purchases
        from
        our PLR customers in 2010. The request currently is pending before the PUC,
        and
        we cannot predict the outcome. We expect that PLR supply and cost recovery
        issues for 2011 and beyond will be addressed by the PLR rules.

Other
        Risks Related to All Segments

(

PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric

)

Our
        operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result
        of
        severe weather conditions.

Our
        businesses may be seasonal. For example, in some markets demand for, and
        market
        prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other
        markets
        such peaks occur in the cold winter months. As a result, our overall operating
        results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis,
        especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold
        weather or storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of
        this
        fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities
        we
        acquire or develop and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity.

We
        cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently
        being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities.
        An
        adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial
        condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We
        are
        involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing
        state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations,
        the
        most significant of which are summarized in "Legal Matters," "Regulatory
        Issues"
        and in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
        Statements. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor
        can we
        reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially result
        from a
        negative outcome in each case.

We
        may need significant additional financing to pursue growth
        opportunities.

We
        continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may
        enter
        into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the
        future. An acquisition agreement or development commitment may require access
        to
        substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable terms. We also may
        need
        external financing to fund capital expenditures, including capital expenditures
        necessary to comply with environmental regulations or other regulatory
        requirements. Our ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are
        dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, credit
        availability and our financial performance. The inability to obtain sufficient
        financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability
        to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital
        expenditures.

A
        downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access
        capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any
        new
        debt.

Our
        current credit ratings by Moody's, Fitch and S&P are listed in

"Item
        7.
        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

While we
        do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund our short-term
        liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any ratings downgrades
        could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability
        to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term
        debt.

Significant
        increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including our health
        care
        and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and
        liquidity.

We
        continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation
        and
        maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost
        pressures, especially with respect to health care and pension costs. Pursuant
        to
        our collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide
        specified levels of health care and pension benefits to current employees
        and
        retirees covered by the contracts, and we provide a similar level of benefits
        to
        our management employees, which benefits give rise to significant expenses.
        We
        have experienced significant health care cost inflation in the last few years,
        and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage,
        to
        continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to continue
        to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the
        costs
        of their health care benefits. In addition, we expect to continue to experience
        significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans that
        we
        sponsor for our employees and retirees. The measurement of our expected future
        health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent
        on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control.
        These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care
        cost
        trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan
        participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our costs could
        be
        significantly increased.

There
        is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future
        for
        certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our
        earnings.

Under
        GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an
        annual
        basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these
        assets
        may be impaired. While no goodwill impairments were required based on our
        annual
        review in the fourth quarter of 2006, we are unable to predict whether any
        impairment charges may be necessary in the future.

We
        also
        review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances
        indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
        During
        2006, PPL recorded a loss on the sale of our interest in the Griffith plant
        and
        fully impaired our synfuel-related assets. See Notes 10 and 15 to the Financial
        Statements. We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other
        losses
        on sale of other assets or businesses, may be necessary in the future. In
        particular, our ability to recover our investment in our gas-fired generation
        facilities, and to avoid any future impairment charges with respect to these
        assets, will depend upon future electricity and fuel price levels (which
        are
        subject to substantial fluctuations), as well as applicable accounting rules
        and
        other factors.

ITEM
        7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF
        OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
        is an
        energy and utility holding company with headquarters in Allentown, PA. Please
        refer to Exhibit 99(a) in Item 15 for a listing of the current corporate
        organization and to "Item 1. Business - Background," for descriptions of
        PPL's
        reportable segments, which are Supply, International Delivery and Pennsylvania
        Delivery. Through its subsidiaries, PPL is primarily engaged in the generation
        and marketing of electricity in two key markets - the northeastern and western
        U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity in Pennsylvania, the U.K. and Latin
        America. PPL's overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth in energy
        supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings
        and to
        achieve stable, long-term growth in regulated delivery businesses through
        efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations. More
        specifically, PPL's strategy for its electricity generation and marketing
        business is to match energy supply with load, or customer demand, under
        contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture
        profits
        while effectively managing exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices
        and
        counterparty credit risk. PPL's strategy for its electricity delivery businesses
        is to own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost while
        maintaining high levels of customer service and reliability.

PPL
        faces
        several risks in its generation business. The principal risks are electricity
        and capacity wholesale price risk, fuel price risk, power plant performance,
        evolving regulatory frameworks and counterparty credit risk. PPL attempts
        to
        manage these risks through various means. For instance, PPL operates a portfolio
        of generation assets that is diversified as to geography, fuel source, cost
        structure and operating characteristics. PPL currently expects to expand
        its
        generation capacity over the next several years through power uprates at
        certain
        of its power plants, the potential construction of new plants and the potential
        acquisition of existing plants or businesses. PPL is and will continue to
        remain
        focused on the operating efficiency and availability of its existing and
        any
        newly constructed or acquired power plants. In addition, PPL has executed
        and
        continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel
        supply, and other means to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes
        in
        the difference, or margin, between the cost to produce electricity and the
        price
        at which PPL sells it. Whether PPL decides to, or is able to, continue to
        enter
        into long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel purchase agreements
        or
        renew its existing agreements and the market conditions at that time will
        affect
        its future profitability. Currently, PPL's commitments for energy sales are
        substantially satisfied through its own generation assets - i.e., PPL primarily
        markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through
        integrated generation, marketing and trading functions. However, PPL's future
        marketing efforts may rely less on PPL's generation assets and more on supply
        contracted from others. PPL has in place risk management programs that, among
        other things, are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility
        of
        earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest
        rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the
        operational performance of its generating units.

The
        principal challenge that PPL faces in its electricity delivery businesses
        is to
        maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective
        manner. PPL's electricity delivery businesses are rate-regulated. Accordingly,
        these businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that
        they
        may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer
        rates.
        PPL Electric's PLR obligation and the associated recovery from customers
        of its
        energy supply costs after 2009, when PPL Electric's full requirements energy
        supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus expire, will be determined by the PUC
        pursuant to rules that have not yet been promulgated. To address this risk,
        PPL
        Electric has filed a plan with the PUC detailing how it proposes to acquire
        its
        electricity supply for non-shopping customers after 2009. In February 2007,
        a
        PUC Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended decision approving PPL
        Electric's plan with minor modifications. PPL Electric cannot predict when
        the
        PUC will act on the recommended decision or what action it will take. Also,
        in
        February 2007, the PUC issued proposed PLR regulations and a policy statement
        regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. The PUC
        is
        requesting public comment on both the regulations and policy statement. At
        current forward market prices, PPL Electric currently estimates that customer
        rates could increase by about 20% in 2010.

PPL
        faces
        additional financial risks in conducting international operations, such as
        fluctuations in currency exchange rates. PPL attempts to manage these financial
        risks through its risk management programs.

A
        key
        challenge for PPL's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile.
        Investors, analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy
        industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position
        of
        these companies. PPL continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital
        structure and liquidity position, thereby managing its target credit
        profile.

See
        "Item
        1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning the material risks that
        PPL
        faces in its businesses.

The
        purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL's past and
        expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the
        risks and challenges mentioned above. Specifically:

The
        information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL's
        Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

Supply
        Segment

The
        Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
        generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
        Supply.

The
        Supply segment results in 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflect the reclassification
        of
        the Griffith plant revenues and expenses from certain income statement line
        items to "Loss from Discontinued Operations." The Supply segment results
        in 2005
        and 2004 also reflect the reclassification of the Sundance plant revenues
        and
        expenses from certain income statement line items to "Loss from Discontinued
        Operations." See Notes 9 and 10 to the Financial Statements for further
        discussion.

In
                  the first quarter of 2005, PPL recognized a charge for a loss contingency
                  related to litigation with NorthWestern. In September 2005, PPL
                  and
                  NorthWestern reached a final agreement to settle this
                  litigation.

        Outlook

PPL
        projects significantly higher earnings in its supply business segment in
        compared with 2006. Based on current forward energy prices and hedges already
        in
        place, PPL is projecting higher energy margins, driven primarily by the
        replacement of expiring fixed-price supply obligations with higher-margin
        wholesale energy contracts, and an increase in generation prices under the
        PUC-approved PLR contracts between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus for customers
        who choose not to shop for an energy supplier.

While
        PPL
        expects improved baseload power plant performance in 2007, this performance
        will
        be somewhat offset by the retirement in September of two coal units at the
        Martins Creek power plant in Pennsylvania and by more planned outages, including
        the Susquehanna Unit 1 outage to address the remaining control rod friction
        issues. PPL believes these planned outages will improve the overall long-term
        reliability of PPL's generation fleet. PPL also expects a modest increase
        in
        fuel-related expenses and increased operation and maintenance
        expenses.

International
        Delivery Segment

The
        International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
        businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
        electricity. Substantially all of PPL Global's international businesses are
        located in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia.

        Outlook

PPL
        projects the earnings from its international delivery business segment to
        decline in 2007 compared with 2006. Higher delivery margins, due to higher
        unit
        sales in Latin America and higher unit prices in the U.K., are expected to
        be
        offset by increased operating expenses in the majority of these delivery
        businesses and a significantly higher effective tax rate in the U.K. due
        to the
        favorable resolution of several tax-related items in 2006. In addition, PPL
        does
        not expect gains from the sale or liquidation of U.K. non-electricity delivery
        businesses to continue at the same level in 2007 as occurred in 2006.

        Outlook

PPL
        expects the Pennsylvania Delivery segment to have flat earnings in 2007 compared
        with 2006, with modest load growth being offset by increased operation and
        maintenance expenses.

In
        late
        March 2007, PPL Electric expects to file a request with the PUC seeking an
        increase in its distribution rates beginning in January 2008.

Changes
        in Domestic Gross Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
        gross energy margins are generated through PPL's non-trading and trading
        activities. PPL manages its non-trading energy business on a geographic basis
        that is aligned with its generation assets. Additionally, beginning in 2006,
        PPL
        further segregates non-trading activities into two categories: hedge activity
        and economic activity. Economic activity represents the net unrealized effect
        of
        derivative transactions that are entered into as economic hedges, but do
        not
        qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting was not elected, under
        SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
        as amended and interpreted.

Eastern
        U.S.

Eastern
        U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
        due
        to higher PLR sales prices and higher wholesale prices. PLR sales prices
        were
        8.4% higher in 2006, in accordance with the schedule established by the PUC
        Final Order. Partially offsetting these higher margins was lower nuclear
        generation of 3%, as well as higher coal and nuclear fuel prices, which were
        up
        12% and 10%.

In
        2005,
        PPL began participating in the Midwest ISO (MISO), an independent transmission
        system operator that serves the electric transmission needs of much of the
        Midwest. PPL records its business activities within MISO consistent with
        its
        accounting for activities in other RTOs.

Eastern
        U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily
        due to
        higher fuel costs. Average coal prices increased by 12% over 2004, while
        average
        gas and oil prices increased by 24%. Despite record high generation in 2005,
        the
        increased use of higher-cost oil and gas units to cover retail volumes, which
        were up 5% over 2004, and generation output lost during coal and nuclear
        plant
        outages contributed to lower margins. Due to market price increases and changes
        in fuel mix, average fuel prices increased 22% over 2004. Partially offsetting
        the effects of higher fuel costs was a 2% increase in PLR sales prices, in
        accordance with the schedule established by the PUC Final Order.

The
        amount of Eastern non-trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market
        transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for
        which
        hedge accounting was not elected, and from hedge ineffectiveness was a loss
        of
        $8 million in 2006, compared with a loss of $4 million in 2005, and an
        immaterial loss in 2004.

Western
        U.S.

Northwestern
        U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
        due
        to higher wholesale prices. Also contributing to the increase was a 6% increase
        in hydroelectric generation. Partially offsetting these improvements were
        higher
        coal prices, which were up 14%.

Southwestern
        U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2006 compared with 2005, as well as
        in
        2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the sale of PPL's 50% interest
        in the
        Griffith plant in June 2006 and the sale of PPL's Sundance plant in May 2005.

The
        amount of Western non-trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market
        transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for
        which
        hedge accounting was not elected, and from hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial
        in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Net
        Energy Trading

PPL
        enters into certain energy contracts that meet the criteria of trading
        derivatives as defined by EITF Issue 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting
        for
        Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in
        Energy
        Trading and Risk Management Activities." These physical and financial contracts
        cover trading activity associated with electricity, gas and oil.

Net
        energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2006 compared to 2005
        primarily due to contracts reclassified as trading activity from hedge
        (non-trading) transactions related to the Griffith plant after the announced
        plan to sell PPL's interest in the plant. See Note 10 to the Financial
        Statements for additional information.

Net
        energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004,
        primarily due to the inclusion of FTRs. As of July 1, 2005, FTRs were
        deemed to meet the definition of a derivative and were accounted for as such
        prospectively. Therefore, the forward and realized value for FTRs entered
        into
        for speculative purposes is accounted for as part of "Net energy trading
        margins" on the Statement of Income. From July 1 through December 31, 2005,
        gains on speculative FTRs totaled $10 million.

The
        amount of energy trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market transactions
        was
        a $9 million gain in 2006, a $5 million loss in 2005, and a $13 million gain
        in
        2004.

Energy-related
        Businesses

Energy-related
        businesses contributed $31 million more to operating income in 2006 compared
        with 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to:

·

$18
                  million of lower pre-tax losses from synfuel projects. This reflects
                  $29
                  million of lower operating losses due to lower production levels,
                  partially offset by an impairment charge of $10 million on the
                  synfuel-related assets;

·

an
                  $8 million increase from PPL Telcom due to an increase in
                  transport-related sales, as well as reduced spending on a product
                  line
                  (before depreciation, interest expense and income taxes);
                  and

·

a
                  $3 million increase from WPD's telecommunications
                  business.

Energy-related
        businesses contributed $8 million more to operating income in 2005 compared
        with
        2004. The increase was attributable to:

See
        Note
        15 to the Financial Statements for an overall assessment of synthetic fuel
        tax
        credits and a further discussion of the impairment of these facilities and
        the
        temporary shutdown of one of these facilities.

Other
        Operation and Maintenance

For
        the
        year ended 2006, PPL's other operation and maintenance expense was reduced
        by a
        $36 million pre-tax one-time credit in connection with the realization of
        benefits related to the ability to use excess Black Lung Trust assets to
        make
        future benefit payments for retired miners' medical benefits. See Note 13
        to the
        Financial Statements for additional information.

Excluding
        this one-time credit, the increases in other operation and maintenance expenses

Taxes,
        Other Than Income

A
        $6
        million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense, offset by a $2 million
        decrease in domestic capital stock tax expense and a $2 million decrease
        in
        domestic real estate tax expense, are the primary reasons for the $3 million
        increase in taxes, other than income, in 2006 compared with 2005.

In
        2004,
        PPL Electric reversed a $14 million accrued liability for 1998 and 1999 PURTA
        taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings
        regarding the Susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment. The rights of
        third-party intervenors to further appeal expired in 2004. The reversal and
        a
        $19 million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense, offset by an
        $8
        million decrease in domestic capital stock expense in 2005, are the primary
        reasons for the $30 million increase in taxes, other than income in 2005,
        compared with 2004.

Discontinued
        Operations

In
        2006,
        PPL recorded a $23 million loss, which is net of a tax benefit of $16 million,
        in connection with the sale of its ownership interest in the Griffith plant.
        The
        "Loss from Discontinued Operations" also includes the acceleration of net
        unrealized gains on derivatives associated with the Griffith plant of $7
        million
        after tax. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on this
        sale,
        along with information regarding operating results recorded prior to the
        sale.

In
        2005,
        PPL recorded a $47 million loss, which is net of a tax benefit of $26 million,
        in connection with the sale of its Sundance power plant. See "Discontinued
        Operations" in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information on this
        sale,
        along with information regarding operating losses recorded prior to the sale
        of
        the Sundance plant and for operating losses recorded in 2004 related to the
        sale
        of PPL Global's investment in a Latin American telecommunications
        company.

Cumulative
        Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

PPL
        adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
        an
        Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," in 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that
        an
        entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional
        ARO when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.
        FIN
        47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
        estimate the fair value of an ARO. Application of the interpretation resulted
        in
        a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that decreased net
        income by $8 million in 2005. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for
        additional information.

Financial
        Condition

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

PPL
        is
        focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and strengthening
        its
        balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit profile. PPL believes
        that its cash on hand, short-term investments, operating cash flows, access
        to
        debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken as a whole,
        provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements,
        future
        security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures. PPL currently
        expects cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of 2007
        to
        be approximately $600 million and expects to increase its credit facilities
        from
        $3.4 billion to greater than $4.0 billion in 2007. However, PPL's cash flows
        from operations and its access to cost-effective bank and capital markets
        are
        subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:

At

Operating
        Activities

Net
        cash
        from operating activities increased by 27%, or $370 million, in 2006 compared
        with 2005, primarily as a result of higher domestic retail electric revenues
        resulting from an 8.4% increase in PLR sales prices and increased international
        delivery revenues, predominantly related to price increases and changes in
        customer mix. The increase from 2005 to 2006 was also due, to a lesser extent,
        to reduced expenditures for oil in 2006 as a result of building up inventory
        in
        2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in domestic delivery
        revenues resulting from a decrease in sales volumes, due in part to milder
        weather in 2006, increased expenditures for coal and increased U.S. income
        tax
        payments, primarily due to lower utilization of foreign tax credits in 2006.

Net
        cash
        from operating activities decreased by 7%, or $109 million, in 2005 compared
        with 2004, primarily as a result of increased income tax payments and fuel
        expenditures, partially offset by favorable margin impacts attributable to
        the
        7.1% increase in distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries effective
        January 1, 2005. Income tax payments increased primarily due to favorable
        impacts of tax credits and refunds realized in 2004. Fuel expenditures increased
        $115 million due to increased prices and inventory build-up in anticipation
        of
        price increases in 2006.

PPL
        expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating activities
        as
        a result of its long-term and intermediate-term power sales commitments from
        wholesale and retail customers and long-term fuel purchase contracts. PPL
        estimates that, on average, approximately 89% of its expected annual generation
        output for the period 2007 through 2009 is committed under long-term and
        intermediate-term power sales contracts. PPL has started and will continue
        to
        layer in sales contracts in the wholesale markets for the capacity and energy
        currently committed under the PLR supply contracts with PPL Electric, which
        expire at the end of 2009. Based on the way in which the wholesale markets
        have
        developed to this point, new contracts may be of a shorter duration than
        the PLR
        supply contracts, which at inception had terms of approximately nine years.

PPL's
        contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require
        cash
        collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of
        a
        portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a
        downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes
        in
        market prices. For example, in addition to limiting its trading ability,
        if
        PPL's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment grade"
        and
        energy prices increased by 10%, PPL estimates that, based on its December
        31,
        2006 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of approximately
        $387 million, compared with $611 million at December 31, 2005. PPL has in
        place
        risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure
        to
        volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices, interest rates,
        foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operational
        performance of its generating units.

Investing
        Activities

The
        primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures. See
        "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2006
        and
        projected expenditures for the years 2007 through 2011.

Net
        cash
        used in investing activities increased 108%, or $838 million, in 2006 compared
        with 2005. There were a few items that contributed to this increase. Capital
        expenditures increased $583 million, primarily as a result of the construction
        of pollution control equipment at coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, as
        discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, and $107 million related
        to
        the purchase of leased equipment. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements
        for
        further discussion of the purchase of leased equipment in connection with
        the
        termination of the related master lease agreements. Additionally, there was
        an
        increase of $298 million in net purchases of short-term investments, and
        PPL
        received $80 million less in proceeds from the sale of power plants in 2006
        compared with 2005. The impact of the above items was partially offset by
        a
        decrease of $75 million in net purchases of emission allowances and a decrease
        of $22 million in the additional amount of cash that became restricted.

Although
        net cash used in investing activities remained stable in 2005 compared with
        2004, there were significant changes in certain components. PPL received
        $190
        million in proceeds from the sale of the Sundance power plant in 2005, compared
        with $123 million of proceeds from the sale of PPL's minority interest in
        CGE in
        2004. Additionally, there was an increase of $58 million in net proceeds
        from
        the sales of short-term investments, an increase of $77 million in capital
        expenditures and an increase of $63 million in net purchases of emission
        allowances, in anticipation of future generation.

Financing
        Activities

Net
        cash
        provided by financing activities was $95 million in 2006, compared with net
        cash
        used in financing activities of $676 million in 2005 and $578 million in
        2004.
        The change from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflects increased issuance of long-term
        debt, as well as the issuance of preference stock. In 2006, cash provided
        by
        financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $277 million,
        net proceeds of $245 million from the issuance of preference stock and $21
        million of common stock sale proceeds, partially offset by common and preferred
        distributions paid of $419 million. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements
        for
        details regarding the preference stock issued by PPL Electric.

The
        increase in cash used in financing activities from 2004 to 2005 primarily
        reflects the continued retirement of long-term debt and increased dividends
        to
        shareowners. In 2005, cash used in financing activities primarily consisted
        of
        net debt retirements of $340 million and common and preferred distributions
        paid
        of $349 million, partially offset by common stock sale proceeds of $37 million.
        In 2004, cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt
        retirements of $863 million and common and preferred distributions paid of
        $299
        million, partially offset by common stock sale proceeds of $596 million,
        of
        which $575 million related to the settlement of the common stock purchase
        contracts that were a component of the PEPS Units and the PEPS Units, Series
        B.

See
        "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans to issue debt
        and
        equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available
        to PPL. Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans
        to
        pay dividends on its common and preferred securities and repurchase common
        stock
        in the future, as well as maturities of PPL's long-term debt.

Convertible
                  Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $298 million were
                  presented for conversion in 2006. The total conversion premium
                  related to
                  these conversions was $121 million, which was settled with 3,448,109
                  shares of PPL common stock, along with an insignificant amount
                  of cash in
                  lieu of fractional shares. After such conversions, $102 million
                  of
                  Convertible Senior Notes remain outstanding and are eligible for
                  conversion in the first quarter of 2007. See Notes 4 and 8 to the

        7.0%
        and maturities from 2011 through 2056. See Note 8 to the Financial
        Statements for more detailed information regarding PPL's financing
        activities.

Forecasted
        Sources of Cash

PPL
        expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the
        near
        term, including various credit facilities, commercial paper programs, an
        asset-backed commercial paper program and operating leases. PPL also expects
        to
        continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets, as necessary,
        for
        its long-term financing needs.

In
        addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
        agreements contain various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants
        beyond
        applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
        and/or termination of the agreements. PPL monitors the covenants on a regular
        basis. At December 31, 2006, PPL was in material compliance with these
        covenants. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants and other borrowing
        conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

During
        2007, PPL intends to maintain the existing $3.4 billion of credit facility
        capacity, which may require the renewal and extension or replacement of certain
        facilities. In addition, PPL expects to increase its credit facility capacity
        by
        up to $1.0 billion in 2007 to support potential collateral requirements under
        contracts that it expects to enter into in connection with expanding its
        wholesale marketing and trading business. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
        for further discussion of PPL's credit facilities, including the termination
        and
        replacement of a £150 million credit facility of WPD (South West) with a new
£150 million credit facility at WPDH Limited in January 2007.

Commercial
        Paper

PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric maintain commercial paper programs for up
        to $500
        million for PPL Energy Supply and for up to $200 million for PPL Electric
        to
        provide them each with an additional financing source to fund their short-term
        liquidity needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported
        by certain credit agreements of each company. PPL Energy Supply had no
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, and $100 million of
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005. PPL Electric had no
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. During 2007,
        PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric may issue commercial paper from time to time
        to
        facilitate short-term cash flow needs.

Asset-Backed
        Commercial Paper Program

PPL
        Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through
        which
        PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
        receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary
        on
        an ongoing basis. The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of
        up to
        an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by
        a
        financial institution. PPL Electric uses the proceeds from the program for
        general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of credit. At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the loan balance outstanding was $42 million,
        all of
        which was used to cash collateralize letters of credit. See Note 8 to the
        Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial
        paper
        program.

Operating
        Leases

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through
        operating leases. PPL's subsidiaries lease office space, land, buildings
        and
        certain equipment. These leasing structures provide PPL with additional
        operating and financing flexibility. The operating leases contain covenants
        that
        are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining
        corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees.

PPL,
        through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units
        and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating
        leases. These operating leases are not recorded on PPL's Balance Sheets,
        which
        is in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The leases place certain
        restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets
        and
        declare dividends. At this time, PPL believes that these restrictions will
        not
        limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination
        of
        the leases. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of other
        dividend restrictions related to PPL subsidiaries.

See
        Note
        11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
        leases.

Long-Term
        Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
        to market conditions in 2007, PPL and its subsidiaries currently plan to
        issue
        up to $1.1 billion in long-term debt securities. PPL expects to use the proceeds
        primarily to fund capital expenditures, to fund maturities of existing debt
        and
        for general corporate purposes. PPL currently does not plan to issue significant
        amounts of common stock in 2007.

Forecasted
        Uses of Cash

In
        addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
        purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL currently expects to incur
        future
        cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations,
        payment
        of dividends on its common and preferred securities and possibly the repurchase
        of a portion of its common stock, beginning in 2009.

Capital
        Expenditures

The
        table
        below shows PPL's actual spending for the year 2006 and current capital
        expenditure projections for the years 2007 through 2011.

(a)

Construction
                  expenditures include capitalized interest and AFUDC, which are
                  expected to
                  be approximately $243 million for the 2007-2011
                  period.

PPL's
        capital expenditure projections for the years 2007-2011 total approximately
        $6.8
        billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes
        in operational, market and regulatory conditions. This table includes projected
        costs related to the planned 349 MW incremental capacity increases. See Note
        to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
        installation cost of sulfur dioxide scrubbers and other pollution control
        equipment, which comprise most of the "Environmental" expenditures noted
        above.

PPL
        plans
        to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2007 with cash on hand, cash from
        operations and the issuance of debt securities.

Contractual
        Obligations

PPL
        has
        assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course
        of
        conducting its business. At December 31, 2006, the estimated contractual
        cash
        obligations of PPL were:

The
                  amounts reflected represent WPD’s contractual deficit pension funding
                  requirements arising from an actuarial valuation performed in March
                  and do not include pension funding requirements for future service
                  or a
                  contingent funding requirement of $59 million payable by March
                  31, 2008,
                  if certain conditions are not met by March 31, 2007. The U.K. electricity
                  regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion
                  of the
                  contributions relating to the plan deficit; however, WPD cannot
                  be certain
                  that this will continue beyond the current review period, which
                  extends to
                  March 31, 2010.

Based
                  on the current funded status of PPL's U.S. qualified pension plans,
                  no
                  contributions are required. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements
                  for a
                  discussion of expected
                  contributions.

Dividends

In
        December 2004, PPL's Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy that provides
        for growing the common stock dividend in the future at a rate exceeding the
        projected rate of growth in earnings per share from ongoing operations until
        the
        dividend payout ratio reaches the 50 percent level. Earnings from ongoing
        operations exclude items that management considers unusual. PPL announced
        in
        February 2006 and again in February 2007 its expectation that the growth
        rate of
        its dividends over the next few years will continue to exceed the growth
        rate in
        the company's earnings per share and, therefore, result in a dividend payout
        ratio above 50 percent after 2006. Any future dividends are subject to the
        Board
        of Directors' quarterly dividend declarations, based on the company's financial
        position and other relevant considerations at the time.

PPL
        Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
        preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

Common
        Stock Repurchase

Given
        the
        continued improvement in its credit profile, PPL expects to be in a position
        to
        repurchase a portion of its common stock beginning in 2009.

Credit
        Ratings

Moody's,
        S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
        preferred securities of PPL and its subsidiaries. Based on their respective
        independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions
        or
        ratings affirmations.

A
        credit
        rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
        associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit
        ratings of PPL and its subsidiaries are based on information provided by
        PPL and
        other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a
        recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL or its subsidiaries.
        Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at
        any
        time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating
        that may be assigned to the securities. A downgrade in PPL's or its
        subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced
        access to capital markets.

The
        following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL and its key subsidiaries
        at
        December 31, 2006.

Securities
                  were redeemed in February 2007.

The
        rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL and its key
        subsidiaries in 2006:

Moody's

In
        March
        2006, Moody's took the following actions related to the credit ratings of
        PPL
        and its subsidiaries:

·

PPL
                  - assigned a Baa2 issuer rating;

·

PPL
                  Capital Funding - upgraded the ratings of its senior unsecured
                  debt and
                  Medium Term Notes to Baa2 from Baa3 and subordinated debt to Baa3
                  from
                  Ba1; and

·

PPL
                  Electric - upgraded the issuer rating to Baa1 from Baa2 and upgraded
                  the
                  ratings of its First Mortgage Bonds and Senior Secured Bonds to
                  A3 from
                  Baa1 and upgraded the rating of its preferred stock to Baa3 from
                  Ba1.

In
        March
        2006, Moody's also reviewed the credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and
        concluded that its ratings remain unchanged.

S&P

In
        connection with PPL Electric's issuance of preference stock in April 2006,
        S&P affirmed all of PPL Electric's credit ratings.

In
        November 2006, S&P completed its annual review of its credit ratings for PPL
        and its domestic rated subsidiaries. At that time, S&P affirmed its credit
        ratings and stable outlook for PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Capital Funding,
        PPL
        Electric and PPL Montana.

Fitch

In
        February 2006, Fitch's Europe, Middle East and Africa group implemented Issuer
        Default Ratings (IDRs) based on its new IDR methodology. This implementation
        led
        to Fitch's assignment of the following IDRs and Fitch's upgrading of its
        ratings
        on the following securities of WPD and its affiliates.

·

WPDH
                  Limited IDR of BBB- and senior unsecured rating to BBB from
                  BBB-;

·

WPD
                  LLP IDR of BBB, senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB and preferred
                  stock rating to BBB from BBB-; and

·

WPD
                  (South Wales) and WPD (South West) IDR of BBB+ and senior unsecured
                  debt
                  rating to A- from BBB+.

In
        August
        2006, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook for PPL, PPL Energy
        Supply, PPL Capital Funding and PPL Electric.

In
        November 2006, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook for WPDH
        Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

Ratings
        Triggers

PPL
        Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are convertible
        upon
        the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term credit ratings
        assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB and Ba2, or
        either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes. The terms of the notes
        require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the notes.
        See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the
        Convertible Senior Notes.

WPD
        (South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
        Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
        for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
        S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
        non-investment grade rating of Ba1or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
        event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse
        change
        to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD (South
        Wales)
        operate. These notes totaled $885 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity exposures caused
        by a
        ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would accelerate the due
        dates
        of borrowings. However, if PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's debt ratings had
        been
        below investment grade at December 31, 2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply would
        have had to post an additional $128 million of collateral to counterparties.

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements

PPL
        provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements
        that enable certain transactions. Some of the guarantees contain financial
        and
        other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated
        affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, require early
        maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability
        to
        enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants
        will not limit access to the relevant funding sources.

PPL
        has
        entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of FIN
        45,
        "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
        Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB
        Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34."
        See
        Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion on guarantees.

Risk
        Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
        Risk

Background

Market
        risk is the potential loss PPL may incur as a result of price changes associated
        with a particular financial or commodity instrument. PPL is exposed to market
        risk from:

PPL
        has a
        risk management policy approved by its Board of Directors to manage market
        risk
        and counterparty credit risk. (Credit risk is discussed below.) The RMC,
        comprised of senior management and chaired by the Vice President-Risk
        Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities
        designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs
        include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of
        transactions and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits,
        sensitivity analyses, daily portfolio reporting, including open positions,
        mark-to-market valuations and other risk measurement metrics.

The
        forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may
        occur
        in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance
        on
        model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those
        presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future
        losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses.

Contract
        Valuation

PPL
        utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured
        deals such as tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy
        to
        minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price,
        interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

When
        available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a
        commodity or financial instrument. This may include exchange prices, quotes
        obtained from brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source,
        such
        as a bank. However, market prices for energy or energy-related contracts
        may not
        be readily determinable because of market illiquidity. If no active trading
        market exists, contract valuations may include the use of internally developed
        models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal group. Although
        PPL
        believes that its valuation methods are reasonable, changes in the underlying
        assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization
        in
        future periods.

To
        record
        energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL discounts the forward values,
        as
        appropriate, using the U.S. Utility BBB+ Curve. Additionally, PPL adjusts
        derivative carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit
        quality and potential market illiquidity for net open positions, as
        follows:

Accounting
        and Reporting

To
        account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
        follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
        and
        Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted (together, "SFAS 133"); EITF
        02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
        Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
        Activities;" and EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
        Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for
        Trading
        Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3." In accordance with SFAS 133, all
        derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as
        an
        asset or liability (unless they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion),
        and
        changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized currently in earnings
        unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

In
        accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL reflects its net realized and unrealized gains
        and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes
        in
        the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of Income.

In
        accordance with EITF 03-11, non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at
        major
        market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at
        those
        same delivery points. A major market delivery point is any delivery point
        with
        liquid pricing available.

These
        contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
        management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets. Short-term derivative contracts
        are included in "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities." Long-term derivative
        contracts are included in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred
        Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities."

Accounting
        Designation

Energy
        contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
        treatment. For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative,
        the
        circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are
        entered into determine their accounting designation. In addition to commodity
        transactions, PPL enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency
        swap
        contracts to hedge interest expense and foreign currency risk associated
        with
        both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL also enters into foreign
        currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated
        in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations. As with commodity
        transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the
        transaction determine a contract's accounting designation. These designations
        are verified by an independent internal group on a daily basis. See Note
        18 to
        the Financial Statements for a summary of the guidelines used for the
        designation of derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
        Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
        price risk is one of PPL's most significant risks due to the level of investment
        that PPL maintains in its generation assets. Several factors influence price
        levels and volatilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal
        changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within
        regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions,
        market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal
        and
        state regulations.

To
        hedge
        the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL's energy-related assets,
        liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
        purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based
        tariffs
        throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
        over-the-counter contracts. PPL segregates its non-trading activities as
        either
        hedge or economic. Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity
        qualify
        for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133. The majority of PPL's energy
        transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting. The non-trading economic
        category includes transactions that address a specific risk, but are not
        eligible for hedge accounting or hedge accounting is not elected. Included
        in
        the non-trading economic category are certain load-following energy obligations
        and related supply contracts, FTRs, crude oil swaps to hedge rail transportation
        charges and hedges of synthetic fuel tax credits. Although they do not receive
        hedge accounting treatment, these contracts are considered non-trading.

Within
        PPL's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy contracts
        is
        influenced by the expected value of PPL's generation. In determining the
        number
        of MWhs that are available to be sold forward, PPL reduces the maximum potential
        output that a plant may produce by three factors - planned maintenance,
        unplanned outages and economic conditions. The potential output of a plant
        is
        first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance
        on a particular unit. Another reduction, representing the unplanned outage
        rate,
        is the amount of MWhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to
        such
        factors as equipment breakage. Finally, the potential output of certain plants
        (such as peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of production
        will
        not allow them to economically run during all hours.

PPL's
        non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts that
        qualify for accrual accounting. The net obligation to serve these contracts
        changes minute by minute. Anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are
        affected by expected load changes, regional economic drivers and seasonality.
        PPL analyzes historical on-peak and off-peak usage patterns, expected load
        changes, regional economic drivers, and weather patterns, among other factors,
        to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the
        usage
        patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility. To satisfy its full
        requirements obligations, PPL may enter into contracts to purchase unbundled
        products of electricity, capacity, renewable energy credits (RECs) and other
        ancillary products. Alternatively, PPL may reserve a block amount of generation
        for full requirements contracts that is expected to be the best match with
        their
        anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks.

Besides
        energy commodities, PPL implemented a program in 2006 to hedge its exposures
        to
        changes in market prices of certain metals necessary for the scrubbers PPL
        is
        installing at the Brunner Island and Montour generating plants. These contracts
        qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

PPL's
        non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various times through
        2012.
        The fair value of the non-trading economic contracts that do not qualify
        for
        accrual or hedge accounting treatment as of December 31, 2006, including
        net
        premiums on options, was $19 million. The following chart sets forth PPL's
        net
        fair market value of all non-trading commodity derivative contracts as of
        December 31.

The
        following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL's non-trading commodity
        derivative contracts at December 31, 2006, based on whether the fair values
        are
        determined by quoted market prices or other more subjective means.

The
        "Prices actively quoted" category includes the fair value of exchange-traded
        natural gas futures contracts quoted on the NYMEX, which has quoted prices
        through 2012.

The
        "Prices provided by other external sources" category includes PPL's forward
        positions and options in natural gas and electricity and natural gas basis
        swaps
        at points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker quotes are available.

The
        "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the
        value
        of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed
        as
        a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of
        the
        market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC broker.
        This category includes the fair value of transactions completed in auction
        markets, where contract prices represent the market value for load-following
        bundled energy prices delivered at illiquid delivery points. The transaction
        prices associated with the contracts did not equal the wholesale bilateral
        market prices at inception (Day 1). However, EITF 02-3 does not generally
        permit Day 1 gains and losses to be recognized unless the fair value is
        derived principally from observable market inputs. Therefore, PPL recorded
        a
        reserve for the modeled Day 1 gain, which is netted against the above fair
        values.

Because
        of PPL's efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets,
        PPL sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward
        basis, resulting in open contractual positions. If PPL is unable to deliver
        firm
        capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements,
        under certain circumstances it could be required to pay damages. These damages
        would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract
        price
        of the commodity. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets,
        such damages could be significant. Extreme weather conditions, unplanned
        power
        plant outages, transmission disruptions, non-performance by counterparties
        (or
        their own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors
        could affect PPL's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant
        increases in the market price of replacement energy. Although PPL attempts
        to
        mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully
        meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for
        failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty non-performance
        in the future.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
        across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value
        of
        the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by approximately $303
        million, compared with a decrease of $275 million at December 31, 2005. For
        purposes of this calculation, an increase in the market price for electricity
        is
        considered an adverse movement because PPL's electricity portfolio is generally
        in a net sales position, and the decrease in the market price for fuel is
        considered an adverse movement because PPL's commodity fuels portfolio is
        generally in a net purchase position. PPL enters into those commodity contracts
        to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity.

In
        accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL does not completely hedge its
        generation output or fuel requirements. PPL estimates that for its entire
        portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical and financial
        energy
        positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones
        and
        time periods would decrease expected 2007 gross margins by $13 million.
        Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices would decrease
        expected 2007 gross margins by $57 million.

The
        data
        in the above tables includes the activity for PPL's synthetic fuel tax credit
        hedges. Additional information regarding these hedges can be found in the
        "Synthetic Fuel Tax Credit Risk" section below.

Commodity
        Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
        also
        executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities. As a
        result, PPL may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that
        could
        result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction
        anticipated. The margins from these trading activities are shown in the
        Statements of Income as "Net energy trading margins."

PPL's
        trading contracts mature at various times through 2010. The following chart
        sets
        forth PPL's net fair market value of trading contracts as of December
        31.

PPL
        will
        reverse a gain of approximately $11 million of the $41 million unrealized
        trading gains over the first three months of 2007 as the transactions are
        realized.

The
        following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL's trading portfolio
        at
        December 31, 2006, based on whether the fair values are determined by quoted
        market prices or other more subjective means.

See
        "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)" for information on the various sources
        of
        fair value.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
        across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value
        of
        the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $37 million, compared
        with a
        decrease of $23 million at December 31, 2005.

Interest
        Rate Risk

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations which exposes
        them
        to interest rate risk. PPL utilizes various financial derivative products
        to
        adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio,
        adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in treasury rates (and
        interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation of future financing,
        when
        appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to
        balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the
        fair
        value of PPL's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest
        rates.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL's potential annual exposure to increased interest
        expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $10 million, compared
        with $7 million at December 31, 2005.

PPL
        is
        also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international
        debt
        portfolios. At December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that its potential exposure
        to a
        change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement
        in interest rates, was $336 million, compared with $200 million at December
        31,
        2005.

PPL
        utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the
        expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments. These risks
        include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable
        rate debt and for future anticipated financing. While PPL is exposed to changes
        in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of
        these
        instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in
        the
        same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. At December
        31,
        2006, the market value of these instruments, representing the amount PPL
        would
        pay upon their termination, was $6 million. At December 31, 2006, PPL
        estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these
        instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in the hedged exposure, was $19
        million, compared with $7 million at December 31, 2005.

PPL
        also
        utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and
        floating interest rates in its debt portfolio. While PPL is exposed to changes
        in the fair value of these instruments, any change in market value is recorded
        with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged.
        At
        December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that its potential additional exposure to
        a
        change in the fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement
        in
        interest rates, was $18 million, compared with $12 million at December 31,
        2005.

WPDH
        Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $784 million
        to
        hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated
        bonds
        with maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to December 2028. The estimated
        value of this position at December 31, 2006, being the amount PPL would pay
        to
        terminate it, including accrued interest, was $205 million.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that its potential additional exposure to
        a
        change in the market value of these instruments was $115 million for a 10%
        adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. At
        December 31, 2005, the potential additional exposure for the cross-currency
        swaps outstanding at that time was $143 million for a 10% adverse movement
        in
        foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Foreign
        Currency Risk

PPL
        is
        exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in affiliates
        in
        the U.K. and Latin America. In addition, PPL may make purchases of equipment
        in
        currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL
        has
        adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain
        foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets
        or
        liabilities and net investments. In addition, PPL enters into financial
        instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected
        earnings.

To
        protect 2007 expected income in Chilean pesos, PPL entered into average rate
        forwards for 12.4 billion Chilean pesos. The settlement date of these forwards
        is November 2007. At December 31, 2006, the market value of these positions,
        representing the amount PPL would receive upon their termination, was not
        significant. PPL estimated that its potential additional exposure to a change
        in
        the market value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in
        foreign
        currency exchange rates, was $2 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL
        has
        entered into forward contracts to purchase 10.2 million Euros in order to
        protect against fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate, in connection with
        the
        purchase of equipment. The settlement dates of these contracts are January
        and January 2008. At December 31, 2006, the market value of these positions,
        representing the amount PPL would receive upon their termination, was not
        significant. PPL estimated that its potential additional exposure to a change
        in
        the market value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in
        foreign
        currency exchange rates, was $1 million at December 31, 2006.

On
        the
        Statements of Income, gains and losses associated with hedges of interest
        payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in "Interest Expense."
        Gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected
        in
        "Depreciation." Gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain
        in
        "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the Balance Sheets until the
        investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

Nuclear
        Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
        connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust
        funds
        to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear station.
        As of
        December 31, 2006, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity
        securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair
        value on PPL's Balance Sheet. The mix of securities is designed to provide
        returns to be used to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate
        for
        inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. However, the equity securities
        included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets,
        and
        the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes
        in
        interest rates. PPL actively monitors the investment performance and
        periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear
        decommissioning trust policy statement. At December 31, 2006, a
        hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity
        prices
        would have resulted in an estimated $38 million reduction in the fair value
        of
        the trust assets, compared with a $33 million reduction at December 31,
        2005. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
        the
        nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Synthetic
        Fuel Tax Credit Risk

At
        this
        time, PPL expects that the current level and the volatility of crude oil
        prices
        may reduce the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that PPL receives through
        its synthetic fuel production. The tax credits are reduced if the annual
        average
        wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase-out range. The
        tax
        credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds the phase-out range.
        See
        "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax Credits" in Note 15 to the
        Financial Statements for more information regarding the phase-out of the
        tax
        credits and shutdown of synfuel projects.

PPL
        implemented a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of the variability
        of
        cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel tax credits by
        hedging the risk that the 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead price for
        domestic crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

At
        the
        end of 2006, PPL settled net purchased options which mitigated some of the
        reductions in 2006 synthetic fuel tax credits since the annual average wellhead
        price for 2006 is expected to fall within the applicable phase-out
        range.

Additionally,
        PPL has net purchased options for 2007 that are expected to mitigate PPL's
        tax
        credit phase-out risk due to an increase of the average wellhead price in
        2007.
        These positions did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The fair
        value
        of these positions at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was a gain of $8 million
        and
        $10 million. These amounts are reflected in "Energy-related businesses" revenues
        on the Statements of Income.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
        of
        crude oil would have an immaterial impact on the value of the synthetic fuel
        hedges. For purposes of this calculation, a decrease in the market price
        for
        crude oil is considered an adverse movement.

Credit
        Risk

Credit
        risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL would incur as a result of
        non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. PPL
        maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties
        (including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings
        criteria) and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or
        collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit
        risk.
        However, PPL has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric
        utilities, natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing
        and
        trading companies. These concentrations of counterparties may impact PPL's
        overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that
        counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory
        or
        other conditions. As discussed above in "Contract Valuation," PPL records
        certain non-performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty
        with contracts that are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint)
        will default in its performance. In this case, PPL would have to sell into
        a
        lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced market. These reserves
        are
        reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in "Price risk management
        assets"
        on the Balance Sheets. PPL also records reserves to reflect the probability
        that
        a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries PPL has made but not
        yet
        billed. These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance
        Sheets. PPL also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales
        to the
        California ISO for which PPL has not yet been paid, which is reflected in
        "Accounts receivable" on the Balance Sheets. See Note 15 to the Financial
        Statements.

Application
        of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL's
        financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods,
        assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting
        policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to
        the
        financial condition or results of operations of PPL, and require estimates
        or
        other judgments of matters inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates
        or
        other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in
        a
        significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements.
        (These accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
        Statements.) PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting
        policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with its Audit
        Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed the following
        disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies
        with
        the Audit Committee.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Among
        other
        things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework
        for
        measuring fair value. PPL must adopt SFAS 157 no later than January 1, 2008.
        The
        adoption of SFAS 157 is expected to impact the fair value component of PPL's
        critical accounting policies related to "Price Risk Management," "Pension
        and
        Other Postretirement Benefits," "Asset Impairment," "Leasing" and "Asset
        Retirement Obligations." See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for additional
        information regarding SFAS 157.

Pension
        and Other Postretirement Benefits

PPL
        and
        certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
        benefit plans applicable to the majority of the employees of PPL and its
        subsidiaries. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting
        for
        Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
        Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these benefits. In addition, PPL
        adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers'
        Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,"
        effective December 31, 2006. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for
        additional information about the plans and for additional information regarding
        the accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. Under these
        accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit
        obligations and the performance of plan assets. Delayed recognition in earnings
        of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is
        a
        guiding principle of these standards. This delayed recognition of actual
        results
        allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the
        employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are:

In
        selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement
        plans, PPL starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream
        for
        its plans. This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.
        A
        portfolio of over 500 Moody's Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with
        make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
        $370
        billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
        yields
        are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve. The results of this analysis
        are considered in conjunction with other economic data and consideration
        of
        movements in the Moody's Aa bond index to determine the discount rate
        assumption. At December 31, 2006, PPL increased the discount rate for its
        domestic pension plans from 5.70% to 5.94% as a result of this assessment
        and
        increased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from
        5.70% to 5.88%.

A
        similar
        process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
        uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as
        its
        base. At December 31, 2006, PPL increased the discount rate for its
        international pension plans from 4.75% to 5.17% as a result of this
        assessment.

In
        selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
        past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held
        by the
        plans. At December 31, 2006, PPL's expected return on plan assets remained
        at
        8.50% for its domestic pension plans and decreased to 7.75% from 8.00% for
        its
        other postretirement benefit plans. For its international plans, PPL's expected
        return on plan assets remained at 8.09% at December 31, 2006.

In
        selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience
        in
        light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2006, PPL's rate of
        compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic plans. For its
        international plans, PPL's rate of compensation increase was changed to 4.0%
        from 3.75% at December 31, 2006.

In
        selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
        forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2006, PPL's health care
        cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2007, gradually declining to 5.5% for
        2012.

A
        variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact
        on
        accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, reported annual
        net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other
        comprehensive income (OCI). The following chart reflects the sensitivities
        in
        the 2006 financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions
        based on PPL's primary pension and other postretirement benefit plans. While
        the
        chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the
        inverse of this change would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement
        benefit liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension and other
        postretirement benefit cost and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite
        direction. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based
        solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax effects.

The
        total
        net pension and other postretirement benefit obligations recognized by PPL,
        including the impact of adoption of SFAS 158, were $604 million as of December
        31, 2006.

In
        2006,
        PPL recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged
        to
        operating expenses of $85 million. This amount represents a $34 million increase
        from 2005. This increase in expense was partially attributable to PPL's
        international plans and increased recognition of prior losses. Increased
        expense
        for PPL's domestic pension plans was attributable to updated demographic
        assumptions, primarily due to updating the mortality table used to measure
        the
        obligations and costs.

3)

Asset
                Impairment

PPL
        performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including intangibles,
        that
        are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with SFAS 144,
        "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." PPL tests
        for
        impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a
        long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such
        events or changes in circumstances are:

For
        a
        long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the
        sum
        of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
        and
        eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment
        loss
        is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.

In
        determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments
        to
        estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
        value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets. Changes in
        assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result
        in
        significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the
        financial statements. For determining fair value, the FASB has indicated
        that
        quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.
        However, when market prices are unavailable, other valuation techniques may
        be
        used. PPL has generally used discounted cash flow to estimate fair value.
        Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams
        and
        applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the
        cash
        flow streams.

PPL
        has
        determined that, when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying
        value of a long-lived asset are being considered, it uses estimated cash
        flows
        from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario
        is
        clearly the most likely outcome. If no scenario is clearly most likely, then
        a
        probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated
        cash
        flows from the alternative scenarios. For assets tested for impairment as
        of the
        balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test
        consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance
        sheet
        date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the
        assets. That assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised
        based
        on events that occur after the balance sheet date.

During
        2006, PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas-fired generation assets
        for
        impairment, as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value
        of
        these assets may not be recoverable. PPL did not record an impairment of
        these
        gas-fired generation assets in 2006. For these impairment analyses, the most
        significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows. PPL estimates
        future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted
        for any recent sale or purchase commitments. Key factors that impact cash
        flows
        include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sale and
        purchase commitments. A 10% decrease in estimated future cash flows for the
        gas-fired generation assets would not have resulted in an impairment charge.

In
        2006,
        PPL recorded impairments of certain long-lived assets. See Note 15 to the
        Financial Statements for a discussion of the impairment of PPL Energy Supply's
        synfuel projects and Note 9 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
        of an
        impairment recorded by PPL Global.

PPL
        performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets." PPL performs an annual impairment test for
        goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
        that
        the asset might be impaired.

SFAS
        requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
        PPL
        has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating
        segments.

Goodwill
        is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the
        goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
        unit
        with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value
        of a
        reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit
        is
        considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair
        value
        of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount
        of
        impairment loss, if any.

The
        second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
        The
        implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
        of
        goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of
        a
        reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that
        unit as
        if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the
        estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire
        the
        reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
        over
        the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
        of
        goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared
        with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the
        implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
        that
        excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting
        unit's goodwill.

In
        2006,
        PPL was required to complete the second step of the assessment for its U.K.
        reporting unit. This assessment did not result in an impairment charge, as
        the
        implied fair value of the goodwill exceeded the reporting unit's carrying
        value
        of the goodwill. PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill
        impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. PPL
        estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows. For the
        U.K.
        reporting unit, an increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points would
        not
        have resulted in an impairment of goodwill; however, a 10% reduction in the
        forecasted cash flows would have resulted in a $68 million impairment of
        goodwill.

In
        2006,
        no other second-step assessments were required for goodwill in other reporting
        units. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10% or an increase of the
        discount rates by 25 basis points also would not have resulted in an impairment
        of goodwill in other reporting units.

PPL
        also
        performs a review of the residual value of leased assets in accordance with
        SFAS
        13, "Accounting for Leases." PPL tests the residual value of these assets
        annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
        that a leased asset's residual value may have declined. The residual value
        is
        defined by SFAS 13 as the estimated fair value of the leased property at
        the end
        of the lease term. If the review produces a lower estimate of residual value
        than was originally recorded, PPL is required to determine whether the decline
        is other than temporary. If it is other than temporary, the residual value
        will
        be revised using the new estimate. This reduction in the residual value will
        be
        recognized as a loss in the period in which the estimate was changed. If
        the
        review provides a higher estimate of residual value than was originally
        recorded, no adjustment will be made.

In
        testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
        assumptions to estimate: future cash flows; the useful lives of the leased
        assets; the fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
        assets.
        Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in significantly different
        outcomes than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.
        PPL
        used discounted cash flow to determine the estimated fair value of the leased
        assets at the end of the lease term.

In
        2006,
        PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain leased assets.
        This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes to the residual value.
        PPL's estimate was based on using projections of electric and fuel prices
        and
        any firm sale and purchase agreements. An increase of the discount rate by
        basis points or a 10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would have resulted
        in a reduction of the residual value of these leased assets of $1 million
        and $6
        million, if it was determined that the reduction was other than temporary.

Leasing

PPL
        applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," to all leasing
        transactions. In addition, PPL applies the provisions of numerous other
        accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the EITF that provide specific
        guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing
        arrangements. In general, there are two types of leases from a lessee's
        perspective: operating leases (leases accounted for off-balance sheet); and
        capital leases (leases capitalized on the balance sheet).

In
        accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
        discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
        useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating
        or
        capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
        whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease,
        thus
        significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
        statements.

In
        addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
        transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex
        when
        they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
        accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
        assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment
        for
        book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
        and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
        transaction. In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the Colstrip
        generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to PPL
        Montana
        under four 36-year leases. This transaction is accounted for as an operating
        lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements related to
        sale/leaseback arrangements. If for any reason this transaction did not meet
        the
        requirements for off-balance sheet operating lease treatment as a
        sale/leaseback, PPL would have recorded approximately $250 million of additional
        assets and approximately $305 million of additional liabilities on its balance
        sheet at December 31, 2006, and would have recorded additional expenses
        currently estimated at $7 million, after-tax, in 2006.

See
        Note
        11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
        leases.

Loss
                Accruals

PPL
        periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions,
        situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. PPL's accounting
        for
        such events is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and
        other
        related accounting guidance. SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing
        condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to
        possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when
        one
        or more future events occur or fail to occur."

For
        loss
        contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
        indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
        of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
        estimated. The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event
        or
        events are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies
        that might result in gains. PPL continuously assesses potential loss
        contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income taxes,
        regulatory penalties and other events.

PPL
        also
        has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
        events have occurred. For example, estimated losses were accrued when long-term
        purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and
        when
        PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated. Under regulatory accounting,
        PPL Electric recorded the above-market cost of energy purchases from NUGs
        as
        part of its purchased power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs
        were recovered in regulated rates. When the generation business was deregulated,
        the estimated loss associated with these long-term purchase commitments to
        make
        above-market NUG purchases was recorded because PPL Electric was committed
        to
        purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover
        these
        costs in regulated rates. PPL considers these losses to be similar to an
        asset
        impairment or inventory write-downs.

The
        accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
        identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
        events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
        as
        to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
        of
        accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL's
        management.

Initial
        Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
        uses
        its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers, tax specialists
        and
        engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has
        been
        incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Two
        significant loss accruals were initially recorded in 2005. One was the loss
        accrual related to the PJM billing dispute. Another involved the accrual
        of
        remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the Martins
        Creek
        generating station. Significant judgment was required by PPL's management
        to
        perform the initial assessment of these contingencies.

See
        Note
        15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on both of these
        contingencies and see "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for
        a
        discussion of the year-end assessments of these contingencies.

PPL
        has
        identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but that
        do not
        meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS 5 requires disclosure,
        but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably possible"
        that a
        loss has been incurred. The FASB defines "reasonably possible" as cases in
        which
        "the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but
        less
        than likely." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other
        potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under
        SFAS 5.

Reducing
        Recorded Loss Accruals

When
        an
        estimated loss is accrued, PPL identifies, where applicable, the triggering
        events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering events
        generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss
        is
        incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated. The
        following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
        of
        certain recorded loss accruals:

The
        largest loss accrual on PPL's balance sheet, and the loss accrual that changed
        most significantly in 2006, was for an impairment of above-market NUG purchase
        commitments. This loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between
        the
        above-market contract terms, under the purchase commitments, and the expected
        fair value of the electricity to be purchased at the date these contracts
        were
        impaired. This loss accrual was originally recorded at $879 million in 1998,
        when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.

When
        the
        loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
        established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced.
        A
        schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases
        over the lives of the NUG contracts. This loss accrual was transferred to
        PPL
        EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000, corporate realignment. PPL EnergyPlus continues
        to reduce the above-market NUG liability based on the aforementioned schedule.
        As PPL EnergyPlus reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases,
        it
        offsets the actual cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power
        purchase expense more in line with expected market prices. The above-market
        loss
        accrual was $136 million at December 31, 2006. This loss accrual will be
        significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts expires.
        The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in 2014.

Ongoing
        Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
        reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded
        potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing communication
        and
        analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, tax specialists,
        operation management and other parties.

As
        part
        of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL's management
        re-assessed the loss accruals recorded in 2005, for the two contingencies
        described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
        Accrual." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
        information.

·

In
                  March 2006, the FERC rejected the proposed settlement agreement
                  that was
                  filed with the FERC in September 2005. Subsequently, in March 2006,
                  PPL
                  Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC a new proposed settlement
                  agreement. In November 2006, the FERC entered an order accepting
                  the March
                  2006 proposed settlement agreement, upon the condition that PPL
                  Electric
                  agree to certain modifications. In December 2006, PPL Electric
                  and Exelon
                  filed with the FERC a modified offer of settlement (Compliance
                  Filing).
                  Under the Compliance Filing, which must be approved by the FERC,
                  PPL
                  Electric would make a single payment through its monthly PJM bill
                  of $38
                  million, plus interest through the date of payment, and PJM would
                  include
                  a single credit for this amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill. Through
                  December 31, 2006, the estimated interest on this payment would
                  be $4
                  million, for a total payment of $42 million. As a result, at December
                  31,
                  2006, the loss accrual was reduced to $42 million. PPL's management
                  will
                  continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in future
                  periods.

·

In
                  2005, PPL also re-assessed the contingency for the Martins Creek
                  ash basin
                  remediation. Based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications
                  with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies, at December
                  31,
                  2005, PPL's management concluded that $48 million was the best
                  estimate of
                  the cost of the remediation effort.

In
                  2006, PPL reduced the estimate of costs to $37 million, primarily
                  due to
                  an insurance claim settlement. This amount represents management's
                  best
                  estimate of the probable loss associated with the Martins Creek
                  ash basin
                  leak. At December 31, 2006, the remaining contingency for this
                  remediation
                  was $9 million. PPL cannot predict the final cost of the remediation,
                  the
                  outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania DEP, the outcome
                  of
                  the natural resource damage assessment, the outcome of the lawsuit
                  brought
                  by the citizens and businesses and the exact nature of any other
                  regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against
                  PPL as a
                  result of the disposal basin leak. PPL also cannot predict with
                  certainty
                  the extent of the fines or damages that may be sought in connection
                  with
                  any such actions or the ultimate financial impact on PPL. PPL's
                  management
                  will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in
                  future
                  periods.

Income
        Tax Uncertainties

Significant
        management judgment is required in developing PPL's contingencies, or reserves,
        for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The ongoing
        assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management's best
        estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year. Annual tax
        provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
        may
        result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities.
        However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised
        by such
        authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In evaluating the exposure
        associated with various filing positions, PPL accounts for changes in probable
        exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount of benefit that
        should be recognized in the financial statements. An allowance is maintained
        for
        the tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes to be adequate.
        The ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment
        of
        whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized. Management considers
        a
        number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets,
        including forecasts of taxable income in future periods.

In
        June
        2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
        an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." PPL adopted FIN 48 effective January
        1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 alters the methodology PPL currently uses
        to
        account for income tax uncertainties. Effective with the adoption of FIN
        48,
        uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed
        in
        accordance with SFAS 5. See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for a more
        detailed discussion of FIN 48 and for information regarding the expected
        impact
        of adoption.

6)

Asset
                Retirement Obligations

SFAS
        143,
        "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
        associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
        liability in the financial statements. The initial obligation should be measured
        at the estimated fair value. An equivalent amount should be recorded as an
        increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over
        the
        useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability
        should
        be increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income
        statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of
        time.

FIN
        47,
        "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation
        of
        FASB Statement No. 143," clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS
        143.
        FIN 47 specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred
        if the
        fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
        determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates
        to
        calculate fair value. Fair value is developed through consideration of estimated
        retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated
        retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred.
        Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of
        the
        fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those
        identified and recorded in the financial statements. Changes in ARO costs
        and
        settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various AROs and the
        related assets, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes
        are incorporated into the latest estimate of the obligations.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL had AROs totaling $336 million recorded on the Balance
        Sheet. Of this amount, $276 million or 82% relates to PPL's nuclear
        decommissioning ARO. PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding AROs
        are the
        forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates.
        A
        variance in the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or the inflation
        rates could have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The
        following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear
        decommissioning ARO liability at PPL as of December 31, 2006, associated
        with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition. There
        is
        no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset
        or the
        annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of changing the
        assumptions. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change
        based
        solely on a change in that assumption.

PPL
        ENERGY SUPPLY, LLC

ITEM
        7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF
        OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
        Energy Supply is an energy company with headquarters in Allentown, PA. Please
        refer to Exhibit 99(a) in Item 15 for a listing of its principal subsidiaries
        and to "Item 1. Business - Background," for descriptions of PPL Energy Supply's
        domestic and international businesses. Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy
        Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International Delivery. PPL Energy
        Supply is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity
        in
        two key markets - the northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery
        of
        electricity in the U.K. and Latin America. PPL Energy Supply's overall strategy
        is to achieve disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting
        volatility in both cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable, long-term
        growth in regulated international delivery businesses through efficient
        operations and strong customer and regulatory relations. More specifically,
        PPL
        Energy Supply's strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business
        is to match energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts
        of
        varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while
        effectively managing exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and
        counterparty credit risk. PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its international
        electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at
        the
        most efficient cost while maintaining high levels of customer service and
        reliability.

PPL
        Energy Supply faces several risks in its generation business. The principal
        risks are electricity and capacity wholesale price risk, fuel supply and
        price
        risk, power plant performance, evolving regulatory frameworks and counterparty
        credit risk. PPL Energy Supply attempts to manage these risks through various
        means. For instance, PPL Energy Supply operates a portfolio of generation
        assets
        that is diversified as to geography, fuel source, cost structure and operating
        characteristics. PPL Energy Supply currently expects to expand its generation
        capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of
        its
        existing power plants, the potential construction of new plants and the
        potential acquisition of existing plants or businesses. PPL Energy Supply
        is and
        will continue to remain focused on the operating efficiency and availability
        of
        its existing and any newly constructed or acquired power plants. In addition,
        PPL Energy Supply has executed and continues to pursue contracts of varying
        lengths for energy sales and fuel supply, and other means to mitigate the
        risks
        associated with adverse changes in the difference, or margin, between the
        cost
        to produce electricity and the price at which PPL Energy Supply sells it.
        Whether PPL Energy Supply decides to, or is able to, continue to enter into
        long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel purchase agreements or
        renew
        its existing agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect
        its
        future profitability. Currently, PPL Energy Supply's commitments for energy
        sales are substantially satisfied through its own generation assets - i.e.,
        PPL
        Energy Supply primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio
        of
        generating assets through integrated generation, marketing and trading
        functions. However, PPL Energy Supply's future marketing efforts may rely
        less
        on PPL Energy Supply's generation assets and more on supply contracted from
        others. PPL Energy Supply has in place risk management programs that, among
        other things, are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility
        of
        earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest
        rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the
        operational performance of its generating units.

PPL
        Energy Supply's international electricity delivery businesses are
        rate-regulated. Accordingly, these businesses are subject to regulatory risk
        in
        terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that
        they
        may collect in customer rates. The principal challenge that PPL Energy Supply
        faces in its international electricity delivery businesses is to maintain
        high
        standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective manner.
        PPL
        Energy Supply faces additional financial risks in conducting international
        operations, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. PPL Energy Supply
        attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management programs.

A
        key
        challenge for PPL Energy Supply's business as a whole is to maintain a strong
        credit profile. Investors, analysts and rating agencies that follow companies
        in
        the energy industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity

Supply
        Segment

The
        Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
        generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
        Supply.

The
        Supply segment results in 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflect the reclassification
        of
        the Griffith plant revenues and expenses from certain income statement line
        items to "Loss from Discontinued Operations." The Supply segment results
        in 2005
        and 2004 also reflect the reclassification of the Sundance plant revenues
        and
        expenses from certain income statement line items to "Loss from Discontinued
        Operations." See Notes 9 and 10 to the Financial Statements for further
        discussion.

(a)

In
                  the first quarter of 2005, PPL Energy Supply recognized a charge
                  for a
                  loss contingency related to litigation with NorthWestern. In September
                  2005, PPL Energy Supply and NorthWestern reached a final agreement
                  to
                  settle this litigation.

        Outlook

PPL
        Energy Supply projects significantly higher earnings in its supply business
        segment in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on current forward energy prices
        and
        hedges already in place, PPL Energy Supply is projecting higher energy margins,
        driven primarily by the replacement of expiring fixed-price supply obligations
        with higher-margin wholesale energy contracts, and an increase in generation
        prices under the PUC-approved PLR contracts between PPL Electric and PPL
        EnergyPlus for customers who choose not to shop for an energy supplier.

While
        PPL
        Energy Supply expects improved baseload power plant performance in 2007,
        this
        performance will be somewhat offset by the retirement in September of two
        coal
        units at the Martins Creek power plant in Pennsylvania and by more planned
        outages, including the Susquehanna Unit 1 outage to address the remaining
        control rod friction issues. PPL Energy Supply believes these planned outages
        will improve the overall long-term reliability of PPL Energy Supply's generation
        fleet. PPL Energy Supply also expects a modest increase in fuel-related expenses
        and increased operation and maintenance expenses.

International
        Delivery Segment

The
        International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
        businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
        electricity. Substantially all of PPL Global's international businesses are
        located in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia.

        Outlook

PPL
        Energy Supply projects the earnings from its international delivery business
        segment to decline in 2007 compared with 2006. Higher delivery margins, due
        to
        higher unit sales in Latin America and higher unit prices in the U.K., are
        expected to be offset by increased operating expenses in the majority of
        these
        delivery businesses and a significantly higher effective tax rate in the
        U.K.
        due to the favorable resolution of several tax-related items in 2006. In
        addition, PPL Energy Supply does not expect gains from the sale or liquidation
        of U.K. non-electricity delivery businesses to continue at the same level
        in
        2007 as occurred in 2006.

                  reviews

                  revenues and energy costs related to the international operations

                  expenses on the Statements of
                  Income.

Changes
        in Domestic Gross Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
        gross energy margins are generated through PPL Energy Supply's non-trading
        and
        trading activities. PPL Energy Supply manages its non-trading energy business
        on
        a geographic basis that is aligned with its generation assets. Additionally,
        beginning in 2006, PPL Energy Supply further segregates non-trading activities
        into two categories: hedge activity and economic activity. Economic activity
        represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions that are
        entered
        into as economic hedges, but do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge
        accounting was not elected, under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted.

Eastern
        U.S.

Eastern
        U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
        due
        to higher PLR sales prices and higher wholesale prices. PLR sales prices
        were
        8.4% higher in 2006, in accordance with the schedule established by the PUC
        Final Order. Partially offsetting these higher margins was lower nuclear
        generation of 3%, as well as higher coal and nuclear fuel prices, which were
        up
        12% and 10%.

In
        2005,
        PPL Energy Supply began participating in the Midwest ISO (MISO), an independent
        transmission system operator that serves the electric transmission needs
        of much
        of the Midwest. PPL Energy Supply records its business activities within
        MISO
        consistent with its accounting for activities in other RTOs.

Eastern
        U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily
        due to
        higher fuel costs. Average coal prices increased by 12% over 2004, while
        average
        gas and oil prices increased by 24%. Despite record high generation in 2005,
        the
        increased use of higher-cost oil and gas units to cover retail volumes, which
        were up 5% over 2004, and generation output lost during coal and nuclear
        plant
        outages contributed to lower margins. Due to market price increases and changes
        in fuel mix, average fuel prices increased 22% over 2004. Partially offsetting
        the effects of higher fuel costs was a 2% increase in PLR sales prices, in
        accordance with the schedule established by the PUC Final Order.

The
        amount of Eastern non-trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market
        transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for
        which
        hedge accounting was not elected, and from hedge ineffectiveness was a loss
        of
        $8 million in 2006, compared with a loss of $4 million in 2005, and an
        immaterial loss in 2004.

Western
        U.S.

Northwestern
        U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
        due
        to higher wholesale prices. Also contributing to the increase was a 6% increase
        in hydroelectric generation. Partially offsetting these improvements were
        higher
        coal prices, which were up 14%.

Southwestern
        U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2006 compared with 2005, as well as
        in
        2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the sale of PPL Energy Supply's
        50%
        interest in the Griffith plant in June 2006 and the sale of PPL Energy Supply's
        Sundance plant in May 2005.

The
        amount of Western non-trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market
        transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for
        which
        hedge accounting was not elected, and from hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial
        in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Net
        Energy Trading

PPL
        Energy Supply enters into certain energy contracts that meet the criteria
        of
        trading derivatives as defined by EITF Issue 02-3, "Issues Involved in
        Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
        Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." These physical
        and
        financial contracts cover trading activity associated with electricity, gas
        and
        oil.

Net
        energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2006 compared to 2005
        primarily due to contracts reclassified as trading activity for hedge
        (non-trading) transactions related to the Griffith plant after the announced
        plan to sell PPL Energy Supply's interest in the plant. See Note 10 to the
        Financial Statements for additional information.

Net
        energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004,
        primarily due to the inclusion of FTRs. As of July 1, 2005, FTRs were
        deemed to meet the definition of a derivative and were accounted for as such
        prospectively. Therefore, the forward and realized value for FTRs entered
        into
        for speculative purposes is accounted for as part of "Net energy trading
        margins" on the Statement of Income. From July 1 through December 31, 2005,
        gains on speculative FTRs totaled $10 million.

The
        amount of energy trading margins from unrealized mark-to-market transactions
        was
        a $9 million gain in 2006, a $5 million loss in 2005, and a $13 million gain
        in
        2004.

The
        increases in utility revenues for 2006 compared with 2005, excluding foreign
        currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to:

·

an
                  increase in the U.K. due to higher average prices and changes in
                  customer
                  mix; and

·

increases
                  in Latin America due to a 7.3% increase in sales volumes in Chile
                  and an
                  8.6% increase in sales volume in El Salvador and higher generation
                  supply
                  average prices in both countries.

The
        increases in utility revenues for 2005 compared with 2004, excluding foreign
        currency exchange rates impacts, were primarily due to:

·

increases
                  in the U.K. primarily due to favorable customer mix and an incentive
                  revenue award for outstanding customer service; and

·

increases
                  in Latin America due to a 6% increase in sales volumes in El Salvador
                  and
                  a 7% increase in sales volumes in Chile and higher generation supply
                  average prices in both countries.

Energy-related
        Businesses

Energy-related
        businesses contributed $23 million more to operating income in 2006 compared
        with 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to:

·

$18
                  million of lower pre-tax losses from synfuel projects. This reflects
                  $29
                  million of lower operating losses due to lower production levels,
                  partially offset by an impairment charge of $10 million on the
                  synfuel-related assets;

·

a
                  $3 million increase from PPL Telcom due to an increase in
                  transport-related sales, as well as reduced spending on a product
                  line
                  (before depreciation, interest expense, and income taxes);
                  and

·

a
                  $3 million increase from WPD's telecommunications
                  business.

Energy-related
        businesses contributed $4 million more to operating income in 2005 compared
        with
        2004. The increase was attributable to:

·

a
                  $15 million pre-tax loss in 2004, related to the sale of CGE (see
                  Note 9
                  to the Financial Statements for additional information);
                  and

·

an
                  aggregate increase of $4 million from various international subsidiary
                  businesses; partially offset by

·

additional
                  pre-tax losses in 2005 of $16 million on synfuel projects. This
                  reflects
                  $26 million of additional operating losses due to higher production
                  levels, offset by a $10 million net unrealized gain on options
                  purchased
                  to hedge a portion of the risk associated with the phase-out of
                  the
                  synthetic fuel tax credits for 2006 and
                  2007.

        15 to the Financial Statements for an overall assessment of synthetic fuel
        tax
        credits and a further discussion of the impairment of these facilities and the
        temporary shutdown of one of these facilities.

Other
        Operation and Maintenance

The
        increases in other operation and maintenance expenses were due to:

Taxes,
        Other Than Income

Taxes,
        other than income, decreased by $1 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The
        decrease was primarily due to a $4 million decrease in domestic capital stock
        tax expense, partially offset by a $2 million increase in local real estate
        taxes.

                  Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." In connection
                  with the purchase, the related financing was repaid and the deferred

Discontinued
        Operations

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply recorded a $23 million loss, which is net of a tax benefit
        of
        $16 million, in connection with the sale of its ownership interest in the
        Griffith plant. The "Loss from Discontinued Operations" also includes the
        acceleration of net unrealized gains on derivatives associated with the Griffith
        plant of $7 million after tax. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
        information on this sale, along with information regarding operating results
        recorded prior to the sale.

In
        2005,
        PPL Energy Supply recorded a $47 million loss, which is net of a tax benefit
        of
        $26 million, in connection with the sale of its Sundance power plant. See
        "Discontinued Operations" in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information
        on this sale, along with information regarding operating losses recorded
        prior
        to the sale of the Sundance plant and for operating losses recorded in 2004
        related to the sale of PPL Global's investment in a Latin American
        telecommunications company.

Cumulative
        Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

PPL
        Energy Supply adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
        Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," in 2005. FIN 47
        clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair
        value
        of a conditional ARO when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be
        reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
        information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. Application
        of the
        interpretation resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
        principle that decreased net income by $8 million in 2005. See Note 21 to
        the
        Financial Statements for additional information.

Financial
        Condition

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

PPL
        Energy Supply is focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position
        and
        strengthening its balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit
        profile. PPL Energy Supply believes that its cash on hand, short-term
        investments, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets
        and
        borrowing capacity, taken as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund
        its
        ongoing operating requirements, future security maturities and estimated
        future
        capital expenditures. PPL Energy Supply currently expects cash, cash equivalents
        and short-term investments at the end of 2007 to be approximately $500 million
        and expects to increase its credit facilities from $3.2 billion to greater
        than
        $4.0 billion in 2007. However, PPL Energy Supply's cash flows from operations
        and its access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to
        risks
        and uncertainties, including but not limited to:

Operating
        Activities

Net
        cash
        from operating activities increased by 48%, or $402 million, in 2006 compared
        with 2005, primarily as a result of an 8.4% increase in sales prices under
        the
        PLR contracts and increased international delivery revenues, predominantly
        related to price increases and changes in customer mix. The increase from
        to 2006 was also due, to a lesser extent, to reduced expenditures for oil
        in
        2006 as a result of building up inventory in 2005. These increases were
        partially offset by a decrease in revenues under the PLR contracts resulting
        from a decrease in sales volumes, due in part to milder weather in 2006,
        increased expenditures for coal and increased U.S. income tax payments,
        primarily due to lower utilization of foreign tax credits in 2006.

Net
        cash
        from operating activities increased by 36%, or $222 million, in 2005 compared
        with 2004, primarily as a result of the posting of $300 million in cash
        collateral to PPL Electric in 2004 related to the PLR energy supply agreements
        and a decrease in income tax payments, partially offset by an increase of
        $95
        million in fuel expenditures due to increased prices and inventory build-up
        in
        anticipation of price increases in 2006.

PPL
        Energy Supply expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating
        activities as a result of its long-term and intermediate-term power sales
        commitments from wholesale and retail customers and long-term purchase
        contracts. PPL Energy Supply estimates that, on average, approximately 89%
        of
        its expected annual generation output for the period 2007 through 2009 is
        committed under long-term and intermediate-term power sales contracts. PPL
        Energy Supply has started and will continue to layer in sales contracts in
        the
        wholesale markets for the capacity and energy currently committed under the
        PLR
        supply contracts with PPL Electric, which expire at the end of 2009. Based
        on
        the way in which the wholesale markets have developed to this point, new
        contracts may be of a shorter duration than the PLR supply contracts, which
        at
        inception had terms of approximately nine years.

PPL
        Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel
        often require cash collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions
        or
        terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement,
        in the
        event of a downgrade of PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's credit ratings
        or adverse changes in market prices. For example, in addition to limiting
        its
        trading ability, if PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's ratings were
        lowered
        to below "investment grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL Energy
        Supply estimates that, based on its December 31, 2006 positions, it would
        have
        had to post additional collateral of approximately $387 million, compared
        with
        $611 million at December 31, 2005. PPL Energy Supply has in place risk
        management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure
        to
        volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices, interest rates,
        foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operational
        performance of its generating units.

Investing
        Activities

The
        primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures. See
        "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2006
        and
        projected expenditures for the years 2007 through 2011.

Net
        cash
        used in investing activities increased 135%, or $724 million, in 2006 compared
        with 2005. There were a few items that contributed to this increase. Capital
        expenditures increased $440 million, primarily as a result of the construction
        of pollution control equipment at coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, as
        discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, and $29 million related
        to the
        purchase of leased equipment. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for
        further discussion of the purchase of leased equipment in connection with
        the
        termination of the related master lease agreements. Additionally, there was
        an
        increase of $312 million in net purchases of short-term investments, and
        PPL
        Energy Supply received $80 million less in proceeds from the sale of power
        plants in 2006 compared with 2005. The impact of the above items was partially
        offset by a decrease of $75 million in net purchases of emission
        allowances.

Although
        net cash used in investing activities remained stable in 2005 compared with
        2004, there were significant changes in the components. PPL Energy Supply
        received $190 million in proceeds from the sale of the Sundance power plant
        in
        2005, compared to $123 million of proceeds from the sale of PPL Energy Supply's
        minority interest in CGE in 2004. Additionally, there was an increase of
        $63
        million in net proceeds from sales of short-term investments, an increase
        of $72
        million in capital expenditures and an increase of $63 million in net purchases
        of emission allowances, in anticipation of future generation.

Financing
        Activities

Net
        cash
        provided by financing activities was $315 million in 2006, compared with
        net
        cash used in financing activities of $437 million in 2005 and net cash provided
        by financing activities of $35 million in 2004. The change from 2005 to 2006
        primarily reflects increased issuance of long-term debt. In 2006, cash provided
        by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $950
        million and $115 million of contributions from Member, partially offset by
        $712
        million in distributions to Member.

Net
        cash
        used in financing activities increased by $472 million in 2005 compared with
        2004, primarily as a result of the repayment in 2005 of a $495 million note
        that
        was issued to an affiliate in 2004 and a decrease of $308 million of
        contributions from Member, partially offset by an increase of $692 million
        in
        net proceeds from non-affiliate debt and a decrease of $132 million in
        distributions to Member.

(a)

Convertible
                  Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $298 million were
                  presented for conversion in 2006. The total conversion premium
                  related to
                  these conversions was $121 million, which was settled with 3,448,109
                  shares of PPL common stock, along with an insignificant amount
                  of cash in
                  lieu of fractional shares. After such conversions, approximately
                  $102
                  million of Convertible Senior Notes remain outstanding and are
                  eligible
                  for conversion in the first quarter of 2007. See Notes 4 and 8
                  to the
                  Financial Statements for discussion of the terms of the Convertible
                  Senior
                  Notes and further discussion of the conversions.

Issuance
                  includes $446 million of index-linked notes.

(c)

Retirement
                  includes $118 million to settle related cross-currency
                  swaps.

Long-term
        debt issued during 2006 had stated interest rates ranging from 1.541% to
        7.0%
        and maturities from 2011 through 2056. See Note 8 to the Financial
        Statements for more detailed information regarding PPL Energy Supply's financing
        activities.

Forecasted
        Sources of Cash

PPL
        Energy Supply expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
        in the near term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper
        program, operating leases and contributions from Member. PPL Energy Supply
        also
        expects to continue to have access to debt capital markets, as necessary,
        for
        its long-term financing needs.

        Facilities

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply's total committed borrowing capacity

        credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
        addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
        agreements contain various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants
        beyond
        applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
        and/or termination of the agreements. PPL Energy Supply monitors the covenants
        on a regular basis. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply was in material
        compliance with these covenants. At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes
        that
        these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these
        funding sources.

During
        2007, PPL Energy Supply intends to maintain the existing $3.2 billion of
        credit
        facility capacity, which may require the renewal and extension or replacement
        of
        certain facilities. In addition, PPL Energy Supply expects to increase its
        credit facility capacity by up to $1.0 billion in 2007 to support potential
        collateral requirements under contracts that it expects to enter into in
        connection with expanding its wholesale marketing and trading business. See
        Note
        8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL Energy Supply's
        credit facilities, including the termination and replacement of a £150 million
        credit facility of WPD (South West) with a new £150 million credit facility at
        WPDH Limited in January 2007.

Commercial
        Paper

PPL
        Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million
        to
        provide it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity
        needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by
        certain credit agreements of PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy Supply had no
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, and $100 million of
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005. During 2007, PPL Energy
        Supply may issue commercial paper from time to time to facilitate short-term
        cash flow needs.

Operating
        Leases

PPL
        Energy Supply and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that
        are
        provided through operating leases. PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries lease
        office
        space, land, buildings and certain equipment. These leasing structures provide
        PPL Energy Supply with additional operating and financing flexibility. The
        operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements,
        such
        as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment
        of
        rent and other fees.

PPL
        Energy Supply, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest
        in
        Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year,
        non-cancelable operating leases. These operating leases are not recorded
        on PPL
        Energy Supply's Balance Sheet, which is in accordance with applicable accounting
        guidance. The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability
        to
        incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends. At this time, PPL
        Energy Supply believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these
        funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases. See Note
        to the Financial Statements for a discussion of other dividend restrictions
        related to PPL Global subsidiaries.

See
        Note
        11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
        leases.

Long-Term
        Debt Securities and Contributions from Member

Subject
        to market conditions in 2007, PPL Energy Supply currently plans to issue
        up to
        $250 million in long-term debt securities. PPL Energy Supply expects to use
        the
        proceeds primarily to fund capital expenditures, to fund maturities of existing
        debt and for general corporate purposes.

From
        time
        to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Energy Supply's Member,
        PPL Energy Funding, makes capital contributions to PPL Energy Supply. PPL
        Energy
        Supply uses these contributions for general corporate purposes, including
        funding maturities of existing debt.

Forecasted
        Uses of Cash

In
        addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
        purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL Energy Supply currently expects
        to
        incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual
        obligations and distributions to Member.

Capital
        Expenditures

The
        table
        below shows PPL Energy Supply's actual spending for the year 2006 and current
        capital expenditure projections for the years 2007 through 2011.

                  expenditures include capitalized interest, which is expected to
                  be
                  approximately $229 million for the 2007-2011
                  period.

PPL
        Energy Supply's capital expenditure projections for the years 2007-2011 total
        approximately $5.1 billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically
        to reflect changes in operational, market and asset regulatory conditions.
        This
        table includes projected costs related to the planned 349 MW incremental
        capacity increases. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
        information regarding the installation cost of sulfur dioxide scrubbers and
        other pollution control equipment, which comprise most of the "Environmental"
        expenditures noted above.

PPL
        Energy Supply plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2007 with
        cash on
        hand, cash from operations, contributions from Member and the issuance of
        debt
        securities.

Contractual
        Obligations

PPL
        Energy Supply has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in
        the
        ordinary course of conducting its business. At December 31, 2006, the estimated

(b)

The
                  payments reflected herein are subject to change, as certain purchase
                  obligations included are estimates based on projected obligated
                  quantities
                  and/or projected pricing under the contracts. Purchase orders made
                  in the
                  ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented.
                  The
                  payments also include obligations related to nuclear fuel and the
                  installation of the scrubbers, which are also reflected in the
                  Capital
                  Expenditures table presented above.

(c)

The
                  amounts reflected represent WPD’s contractual deficit pension funding
                  requirements arising from an actuarial valuation performed in March
                  and do not include pension funding requirements for future service
                  or a
                  contingent funding requirement of $59 million payable by March
                  31, 2008,
                  if certain conditions are not met by March 31, 2007. The U.K. electricity
                  regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion
                  of the
                  contributions relating to the plan deficit; however, WPD cannot
                  be certain
                  that this will continue beyond the current review period, which
                  extends to
                  March 31, 2010.

Based
                  on the current funded status of PPL Energy Supply's U.S. qualified
                  pension
                  plans, no contributions are required. See Note 13 to the Financial
                  Statements for a discussion of expected
                  contributions.

Distributions
        to Member

From
        time
        to time, as determined by its Board of Managers, PPL Energy Supply makes
        return
        of capital distributions to its Member, which uses the distributions for
        general
        corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs.

Credit
        Ratings

Moody's,
        S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
        preferred securities of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries. Based on
        their
        respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings
        revisions or ratings affirmations.

A
        credit
        rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
        associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit
        ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries are based on information
        provided by PPL Energy Supply and other sources. The ratings of Moody's,
        S&P
        and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of
        PPL
        Energy Supply or its subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions
        or
        withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently
        of
        each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. A
        downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could
        result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
        markets.

The
        following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its
        key
        subsidiaries at December 31, 2006.

Securities
                  were redeemed in February 2007.

The
        rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL Energy Supply and
        its
        key subsidiaries in 2006.

Moody's

In
        March
        2006, Moody's reviewed the credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and concluded
        that its ratings remain unchanged.

S&P

In
        November 2006, S&P completed its annual review of its credit ratings for PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Montana. At that time, S&P affirmed its credit ratings
        and stable outlook for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Montana.

Fitch

In
        February 2006, Fitch's Europe, Middle East and Africa group implemented Issuer
        Default Ratings (IDRs) based on its new IDR methodology. This implementation
        led
        to Fitch's assignment of the following IDRs and Fitch's upgrading of its
        ratings
        on the following securities of WPD and its affiliates.

·

WPDH
                  Limited IDR of BBB- and senior unsecured rating to BBB from
                  BBB-;

·

WPD
                  LLP IDR of BBB, senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB and preferred
                  stock rating to BBB from BBB-; and

·

WPD
                  (South Wales) and WPD (South West) IDR of BBB+ and senior unsecured
                  debt
                  rating to A- from BBB+.

In
        August
        2006, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook for PPL Energy
        Supply.

In
        November 2006, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook for WPDH
        Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

Ratings
        Triggers

PPL
        Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are convertible
        upon
        the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term credit ratings
        assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB and Ba2, or
        either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes. The terms of the notes
        require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the notes.
        See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the
        Convertible Senior Notes.

WPD
        (South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
        Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
        for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
        S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
        non-investment grade rating of Ba1or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
        event. A restructuring event includes

the
        loss
        of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution license under which
        WPD
        (South West) and WPD (South Wales) operate. These notes totaled $885 million
        at
        December 31, 2006.

PPL
        Energy Supply and its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity
        exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would
        accelerate the due dates of borrowings. However, if PPL Energy Supply's debt
        ratings had been below investment grade at December 31, 2006, PPL Energy
        Supply
        and its subsidiaries would have had to post an additional $128 million of
        collateral to counterparties.

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements

PPL
        Energy Supply provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing
        arrangements that enable certain transactions. Some of the guarantees contain
        financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the
        consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
        require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
        affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL
        Energy
        Supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant
        funding sources.

PPL
        Energy Supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within
        the
        scope of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
        Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
        Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB
        Interpretation No. 34." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
        on guarantees.

Risk
        Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
        Risk

Background

Market
        risk is the potential loss PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of price
        changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument. PPL
        Energy Supply is exposed to market risk from:

PPL
        Energy Supply has a risk management policy approved by PPL's Board of Directors
        to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk. (Credit risk is discussed
        below.) The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Vice
        President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk
        control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and
        detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval,
        validation of transactions and market prices, verification of risk and
        transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily portfolio reporting, including
        open positions, mark-to-market valuations and other risk measurement
        metrics.

The
        forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may
        occur
        in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance
        on
        model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those
        presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future
        losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses.

Contract
        Valuation

PPL
        Energy Supply utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
        and
        structured deals such as tolling agreements as part of its risk management
        strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
        price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

When
        available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a
        commodity or financial instrument. This may include exchange prices, quotes
        obtained from brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source,
        such
        as a bank. However, market prices for energy or energy-related contracts
        may not
        be readily determinable because of market illiquidity. If no active trading
        market exists, contract valuations may include the use of internally developed
        models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal group. Although
        PPL
        Energy Supply believes that its valuation methods are reasonable, changes
        in the
        underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and
        realization in future periods.

To
        record
        energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL Energy Supply discounts the forward
        values, as appropriate, using the U.S. Utility BBB+ Curve. Additionally,
        PPL
        Energy Supply adjusts derivative carrying values to recognize differences
        in
        counterparty credit quality and potential market illiquidity for net open
        positions, as follows:

Accounting
        and Reporting

To
        account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
        Energy Supply follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted (together,
        "SFAS
        133"); EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
        Held
        for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
        Management Activities;" and EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses
        on
        Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not
        'Held
        for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3." In accordance with SFAS
        133, all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance
        sheet
        as an asset or liability (unless they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion),
        and changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized currently in earnings
        unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

In
        accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and
        unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held
        for
        trading purposes in the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements
        of
        Income.

In
        accordance with EITF 03-11, non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at
        major
        market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at
        those
        same delivery points. A major market delivery point is any delivery point
        with
        liquid pricing available.

These
        contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
        management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets. Short-term derivative contracts
        are included in "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities." Long-term derivative
        contracts are included in "Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits
        and
        Other Noncurrent Liabilities."

Accounting
        Designation

Energy
        contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
        treatment. For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative,
        the
        circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are
        entered into determine their accounting designation. In addition to commodity
        transactions, PPL Energy Supply enters into financial interest rate and foreign
        currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense and foreign currency risk
        associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL Energy
        Supply
        also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value
        of firm
        commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign
        operations. As with commodity transactions, the circumstances and intent
        existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract's accounting
        designation. These designations are verified by an independent internal group
        on
        a daily basis. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a summary of the
        guidelines used for the designation of derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
        Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
        price risk is one of PPL Energy Supply's most significant risks due to the
        level
        of investment that PPL Energy Supply maintains in its generation assets,
        coupled
        with the volatility of prices for energy and energy-related products. Several
        factors influence price levels and volatilities. These factors include, but
        are
        not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available
        generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability
        within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of
        current and potential federal and state regulations.

To
        hedge
        the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related
        assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells
        and
        purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based
        tariffs
        throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
        over-the-counter contracts. PPL Energy Supply segregates its non-trading
        activities as either hedge or economic. Transactions that are accounted for
        as
        hedge activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133. The
        majority of PPL Energy Supply's energy transactions qualify for accrual or
        hedge
        accounting. The non-trading economic category includes transactions that
        address
        a specific risk, but are not eligible for hedge accounting or hedge accounting
        is not elected. Included in the non-trading economic category are certain
        load-following energy obligations and related supply contracts, FTRs, crude
        oil
        swaps to hedge rail transportation charges and hedges of synthetic fuel tax
        credits. Although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment, these
        contracts are considered non-trading.

Within
        PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy
        contracts is influenced by the expected value of PPL Energy Supply's generation.
        In determining the number of MWhs that are available to be sold forward,
        PPL
        Energy Supply reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce
        by
        three factors - planned maintenance, unplanned outages and economic conditions.
        The potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable
        generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit. Another reduction,
        representing the unplanned outage rate, is the amount of MWhs that historically
        is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage. Finally,
        the potential output of certain plants (such as peaking units) is reduced
        because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically
        run
        during all hours.

PPL
        Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy
        contracts that qualify for accrual accounting. The net obligation to serve
        these
        contracts changes minute by minute. Anticipated usage patterns and energy
        peaks
        are affected by expected load changes, regional economic drivers and
        seasonality. PPL Energy Supply analyzes historical on-peak and off-peak usage
        patterns, expected load changes, regional economic drivers, and weather
        patterns, among other factors, to determine a monthly level of a block of
        electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings
        volatility. To satisfy its full requirements obligations, PPL Energy Supply
        may
        enter into contracts to purchase unbundled products of electricity, capacity,
        renewable energy credits (RECs) and other ancillary products. Alternatively,
        PPL
        Energy Supply may reserve a block amount of generation for full requirements
        contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage
        patterns and energy peaks.

Besides
        energy commodities, PPL Energy Supply implemented a program in 2006 to hedge
        its
        exposures to changes in market prices of certain metals necessary for the
        scrubbers PPL Energy Supply is installing at the Brunner Island and Montour
        generating plants. These contracts qualify for hedge accounting
        treatment.

PPL
        Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various
        times through 2012. The fair value of the non-trading economic contracts
        that do
        not qualify for accrual or hedge accounting treatment as of December 31,
        2006,
        including net premiums on options, was $19 million. The following chart sets
        forth PPL Energy Supply's net fair market value of all non-trading commodity
        derivative contracts as of December 31.

The
        following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL Energy Supply's
        non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2006, based on
        whether the fair values are determined by quoted market prices or other more
        subjective means.

The
        "Prices actively quoted" category includes the fair value of exchange-traded
        natural gas futures contracts quoted on the NYMEX, which has quoted prices
        through 2012.

The
        "Prices provided by other external sources" category includes PPL Energy
        Supply's forward positions and options in natural gas and electricity and
        natural gas basis swaps at points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker
        quotes
        are available.

The
        "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the
        value
        of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed
        as
        a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of
        the
        market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC broker.
        This category includes the fair value of transactions completed in auction
        markets, where contract prices represent the market value for load-following
        bundled energy prices delivered at illiquid delivery points. The transaction
        prices associated with the contracts did not equal the wholesale bilateral
        market prices at inception (Day 1). However, EITF 02-3 does not generally
        permit Day 1 gains and losses to be recognized unless the fair value is
        derived principally from observable market inputs. Therefore, PPL Energy
        Supply
        recorded a reserve for the modeled Day 1 gain, which is netted against the
        above fair values.

Because
        of PPL Energy Supply's efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its
        generation assets, PPL Energy Supply sells electricity, capacity and related
        services and buys fuel on a forward basis, resulting in open contractual
        positions. If PPL Energy Supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and
        energy
        or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain
        circumstances it could be required to pay damages. These damages would be
        based
        on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the
        commodity. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets,
        such
        damages could be significant. Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power
        plant
        outages, transmission disruptions, non-performance by counterparties (or
        their
        own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors
        could
        affect PPL Energy Supply's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant
        increases in the market price of replacement energy. Although PPL Energy
        Supply
        attempts to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will
        be able
        to fully meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages
        for failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty
        non-performance in the future.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
        in
        market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
        the value of the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by
        approximately $303 million, compared with a decrease of $275 million at
        December 31, 2005. For purposes of this calculation, an increase in the
        market price for electricity is considered an adverse movement because PPL
        Energy Supply's electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position,
        and
        the decrease in the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement
        because PPL Energy Supply's commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net
        purchase position. PPL Energy Supply enters into those commodity contracts
        to
        reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity.

In
        accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL Energy Supply does not completely
        hedge its generation output or fuel requirements. PPL Energy Supply estimates
        that for its entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical
        and financial energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across
        all
        geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected 2007 gross margins
        by
        $13 million. Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices
        would
        decrease expected 2007 gross margins by $57 million.

The
        data
        in the above tables includes the activity for PPL Energy Supply's synthetic
        fuel
        tax credit hedges. Additional information regarding these hedges can be found
        in
        the "Synthetic Fuel Tax Credit Risk" section below.

Commodity
        Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
        Energy Supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
        opportunities. As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a net open
        position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices
        do
        not move in the manner or direction anticipated. The margins from these trading
        activities are shown in the Statements of Income as "Net energy trading
        margins."

PPL
        Energy Supply's trading contracts mature at various times through 2010. The
        following chart sets forth PPL Energy Supply's net fair market value of trading
        contracts as of December 31.

PPL
        Energy Supply will reverse a gain of approximately $11 million of the $41
        million unrealized trading gains over the first three months of 2007 as the
        transactions are realized.

The
        following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL Energy Supply's trading
        portfolio at December 31, 2006, based on whether the fair values are determined
        by quoted market prices or other more subjective means.

See
        "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)" for information on the various sources
        of
        fair value.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
        in
        market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
        the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $37 million,
        compared with a decrease of $23 million at December 31, 2005.

Interest
        Rate Risk

PPL
        Energy Supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations
        which exposes them to interest rate risk. Both PPL and PPL Energy Supply
        manage
        interest rate risk for PPL Energy Supply by using various financial derivative
        products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy
        Supply's debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock
        in
        treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation
        of
        future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management
        program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense
        and changes in the fair value of PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio due to
        changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply's potential annual exposure to increased
        interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $4 million,
        compared with $2 million at December 31, 2005.

PPL
        Energy Supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic
        and
        international debt portfolios. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply
        estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its
        debt
        portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was $296 million,
        compared with $151 million at December 31, 2005.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce PPL
        Energy Supply's exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of
        its
        debt instruments. These risks include exposure to adverse interest rate
        movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated
        financing. While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value
        of
        these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these instruments are
        recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the same period
        during
        which the item being hedged affects earnings. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy
        Supply had none of these instruments outstanding. At December 31, 2005, PPL
        Energy Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair
        value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in the hedged
        exposure, was $2 million.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust
        the
        mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio.
        While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these
        instruments, any change in market value is recorded with an equal and offsetting
        change in the value of the debt being hedged. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy
        Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value
        of
        these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was
        $1
        million, compared with $2 million at December 31, 2005.

WPDH
        Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $784 million
        to
        hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated
        bonds
        with maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to December 2028. The estimated
        value of this position at December 31, 2006, being the amount PPL Energy
        Supply
        would pay to terminate it, including accrued interest, was $205
        million.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply estimated that its potential additional
        exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments was $115 million
        for a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
        rates. At December 31, 2005, the potential additional exposure for the
        cross-currency swaps outstanding at that time was $143 million for a 10%
        adverse
        movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Foreign
        Currency Risk

PPL
        Energy Supply is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments
        in affiliates in the U.K. and Latin America. In addition, PPL Energy Supply
        may
        make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply have adopted a foreign currency risk management program
        designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm
        commitments, recognized assets or liabilities and net investments. In addition,
        PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial instruments to protect against
        foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings.

To
        protect 2007 expected income in Chilean pesos, PPL Energy Supply entered
        into
        average rate forwards for 12.4 billion Chilean pesos. The settlement date
        of
        these forwards is November 2007. At December 31, 2006, the market value of
        these
        positions, representing the amount PPL Energy Supply would receive upon their
        termination, was not significant. PPL Energy Supply estimated that its potential
        additional exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments,
        through a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates, was $2
        million at December 31, 2006.

PPL
        Energy Supply has entered into forward contracts to purchase 10.2 million
        Euros
        in order to protect against fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate, in
        connection with the purchase of equipment. The settlement dates of these
        contracts are January 2007 and January 2008. At December 31, 2006, the market
        value of these positions, representing the amount PPL Energy Supply would
        receive upon their termination, was not significant. PPL Energy Supply estimated
        that its potential additional exposure to a change in the market value of
        these
        instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange
        rates,
        was $1 million at December 31, 2006.

        Statements of Income, gains and losses associated with hedges of interest
        payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in "Interest Expense."
        Gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected
        in
        "Depreciation." Gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain
        in

Nuclear
        Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
        connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust
        funds
        to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear station.
        As of
        December 31, 2006, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity
        securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair
        value on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheet. The mix of securities is designed
        to
        provide returns to be used to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to
        compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. However,
        the
        equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation
        in
        equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are
        exposed to changes in interest rates. PPL actively monitors the investment
        performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with
        its
        nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement. At December 31, 2006, a
        hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity
        prices
        would have resulted in an estimated $38 million reduction in the fair value
        of
        the trust assets, compared with a $33 million reduction at December 31, 2005.
        See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding the
        nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Synthetic
        Fuel Tax Credit Risk

At
        this
        time, PPL Energy Supply expects that the current level and the volatility
        of
        crude oil prices may reduce the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that
        PPL
        Energy Supply receives through its synthetic fuel production. The tax credits
        are reduced if the annual average wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls
        within a phase-out range. The tax credits are eliminated if this reference
        price
        exceeds the phase-out range. See "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels
        Tax
        Credits" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
        the phase-out of the tax credits and shutdown of synfuel projects.

PPL
        Energy Supply implemented a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of
        the
        variability of cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel
        tax
        credits by hedging the risk that the 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead
        price
        for domestic crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

At
        the
        end of 2006, PPL Energy Supply settled net purchased options which mitigated
        some of the reductions in 2006 synthetic fuel tax credits since the annual
        average wellhead price for 2006 is expected to fall within the applicable
        phase-out range.

Additionally,
        PPL Energy Supply has net purchased options for 2007 that are expected to
        mitigate PPL Energy Supply's tax credit phase-out risk due to an increase
        of the
        average wellhead price in 2007. These positions did not qualify for hedge
        accounting treatment. The fair value of these positions at December 31, 2006
        and
        2005, was a gain of $8 million and $10 million. These amounts are reflected
        in
        "Energy-related businesses" revenues on the Statements of Income.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
        in
        market prices of crude oil would have an immaterial impact on the value of
        the
        synthetic fuel hedges. For purposes of this calculation, a decrease in the
        market price for crude oil is considered an adverse movement.

Credit
        Risk

Credit
        risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL Energy Supply would incur as a
        result
        of non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. PPL
        Energy Supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to
        counterparties (including requirements that counterparties maintain certain
        credit ratings criteria) and requires other assurances in the form of credit
        support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty
        credit risk. However, PPL Energy Supply has concentrations of suppliers and
        customers among electric utilities, natural gas distribution companies and
        other
        energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations of counterparties
        may impact PPL Energy Supply's overall exposure to credit risk, either
        positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected
        by
        changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. As discussed above in
        "Contract Valuation," PPL Energy Supply records certain non-performance reserves
        to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out
        of
        the money (from the counterparty's standpoint) will default in its performance.
        In this case, PPL Energy Supply would have to sell into a lower-priced market
        or
        purchase from a higher-priced market. These reserves are reflected in the
        fair
        value of assets recorded in "Price risk management assets" on the Balance
        Sheets. PPL Energy Supply also records reserves to reflect the probability
        that
        a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries PPL Energy Supply has
        made
        but not yet billed. These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on
        the
        Balance Sheets. PPL Energy Supply also has established a reserve with respect
        to
        certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL Energy Supply has not yet
        been
        paid, which is reflected in "Accounts receivable" on the Balance Sheets.

        Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

Application
        of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL
        Energy Supply's financial condition and results of operations are impacted
        by
        the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
        accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly
        important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL Energy
        Supply, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
        uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these
        accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information
        presented in the Financial Statements. (These accounting policies are also
        discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.) PPL's senior management
        has
        reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions
        regarding them, with its Audit Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management
        has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these
        critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Among
        other
        things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework
        for
        measuring fair value. PPL Energy Supply must adopt SFAS 157 no later than
        January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 is expected to impact the fair
        value
        component of PPL Energy Supply's critical accounting policies related to
        "Price
        Risk Management," "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," "Asset
        Impairment," "Leasing" and "Asset Retirement Obligations." See Note 23 to

Pension
        and Other Postretirement Benefits

As
        described in Note 13 to the Financial Statements, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries
        sponsor various pension and other postretirement plans and participate in,
        and
        are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension
        and other postretirement costs of plans sponsored by PPL Services based on
        participation in those plans. PPL and PPL Energy Supply follow the guidance
        of
        SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers'
        Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting
        for
        these pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, PPL Energy
        Supply
        adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers'
        Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,"
        effective December 31, 2006. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for
        further details. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made
        regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan
        assets. Delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results
        and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.
        This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition
        of
        costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.
        The
        primary assumptions are:

In
        selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement
        plans, PPL Energy Supply starts with an analysis of the expected benefit
        payment
        stream for its plans. This information is first matched against a spot-rate
        yield curve. A portfolio of over 500 Moody's Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
        with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess
        of
        $370 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
        yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve. The results of
        this
        analysis are considered in conjunction with other economic data and
        consideration of movements in the Moody's Aa bond index to determine the
        discount rate assumption. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply increased
        the discount rate for its domestic pension plans from 5.70% to 5.94% as a
        result
        of this assessment and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement
        benefit plans from 5.55% to 5.79%.

A
        similar
        process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
        uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as
        its
        base. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply increased the discount rate
        for
        its international pension plans from 4.75% to 5.17% as a result of this
        assessment.

In
        selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL Energy Supply considers
        tax
        implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of
        investments held by the plans. At December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply's
        expected return on plan assets was increased from 8.22% to 8.27% for its
        domestic pension plans. For its international plans, PPL Energy Supply's
        expected return on plan assets remained at 8.09% at December 31, 2006.

In
        selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL Energy Supply considers past
        experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2006,
        PPL
        Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic
        plans. For the international plans, the rate of compensation increase was
        changed to 4.0% from 3.75% at December 31, 2006.

In
        selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL Energy Supply considers past
        performance and forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2006, the
        health care cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2007, gradually declining to 5.5%
        for
        2012.

A
        variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact
        on
        accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, reported annual
        net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other
        comprehensive income (OCI). The following chart reflects the sensitivities
        in
        the 2006 financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions
        based on PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's primary pension and other postretirement
        plans. While the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each
        assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued pension and
        other postretirement benefit liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension
        and other postretirement benefit cost and OCI by a similar amount in the
        opposite direction. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the
        change
        based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax
        effects.

The

        net pension and other postretirement benefit obligations recognized by PPL
        Energy Supply, including the impact of adoption of SFAS 158, as of December
        31,
        2006, were $380 million, including pension other postretirement benefit
        liabilities allocated from plans sponsored by PPL Services.

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply was allocated and recognized net periodic pension and other
        postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of $47 million. This amount
        represents a $22 million increase compared with the amounts recognized during
        2005. This increase in expense was partially attributable to PPL's international
        plans, and increased recognition of prior losses. Increased expense for PPL's
        domestic pension plans was attributable to updated demographic assumptions,
        primarily due to updating the mortality table used to measure the obligations
        and costs.

        to
        Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding
        pension
        and other postretirement benefits.

Asset
        Impairment

PPL
        Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including
        intangibles that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance
        with
        SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."
        PPL
        Energy Supply tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
        indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable.
        Examples of such events or changes in circumstances are:

For
        a
        long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the
        sum
        of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
        and
        eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment
        loss
        is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.

In
        determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments
        to
        estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
        value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets. Changes in
        assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result
        in
        significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the
        financial statements. For determining fair value, the FASB has indicated
        that
        quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.
        However, when market prices are unavailable, other valuation techniques may
        be
        used. PPL Energy Supply has generally used discounted cash flows to estimate
        fair value. Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash
        flow
        streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present
        value
        of the cash flow streams.

PPL
        Energy Supply has determined that, when alternative courses of action to
        recover
        the carrying value of a long-lived asset are being considered, it uses estimated
        cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one
        scenario is clearly the most likely outcome. If no scenario is clearly most
        likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration
        estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios. For assets tested for
        impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows
        used
        in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at
        the
        balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the future
        sale of the assets. That assessment made as of the balance sheet date is
        not
        revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.

During
        2006, PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas-fired
        generation assets for impairment, as events and circumstances indicated that
        the
        carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. PPL Energy Supply
        did not
        record an impairment of these gas-fired generation assets in 2006. For these
        impairment analyses, the most significant assumption was the estimate of
        future
        cash flows. PPL Energy Supply estimates future cash flows using information
        from
        its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sale or purchase
        commitments. Key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices
        for
        electricity and gas as well as firm sale and purchase commitments. A 10%
        decrease in estimated future cash flows for the gas-fired generation assets
        would not have resulted in an impairment charge.

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply recorded impairments of certain long-lived assets. See
        Note 15
        to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the impairment of PPL Energy
        Supply's synfuel projects and Note 9 to the Financial Statements for a
        discussion of an impairment recorded by PPL Global.

PPL
        Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with
        SFAS
        142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." PPL Energy Supply performs an
        annual impairment test for goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

SFAS
        requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
        PPL
        Energy Supply has determined its reporting units to be one level below its
        operating segments.

Goodwill
        is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the
        goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
        unit
        with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value
        of a
        reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit
        is
        considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair
        value
        of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount
        of
        impairment loss, if any.

The
        second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
        The
        implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
        of
        goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of
        a
        reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that
        unit as
        if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the
        estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire
        the
        reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
        over
        the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
        of
        goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared
        with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the
        implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
        that
        excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting
        unit's goodwill.

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply was required to complete the second step of the assessment
        for
        its U.K. reporting unit. This assessment did not result in an impairment
        charge,
        as the implied fair value of the goodwill exceeded the reporting unit's carrying
        value of the goodwill. PPL Energy Supply's most significant assumptions
        surrounding the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting
        unit fair values. PPL Energy Supply estimated fair values primarily based
        upon
        discounted cash flows. For the U.K. reporting unit, an increase of the discount
        rate by 25 basis points would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill;
        however, a 10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would have resulted
        in a
        $68 million impairment of goodwill.

In
        2006,
        no other second-step assessments were required for goodwill in other reporting
        units. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10% or an increase of the
        discount rates by 25 basis points also would not have resulted in an impairment
        of goodwill in other reporting units.

PPL
        Energy Supply also performs a review of the residual value of leased assets
        in
        accordance with SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases." PPL Energy Supply tests
        the
        residual value of these assets annually or more frequently whenever events
        or
        changes in circumstances indicate that a leased asset's residual value may
        have
        declined. The residual value is defined by SFAS 13 as the estimated fair
        value
        of the leased property at the end of the lease term. If the review produces
        a
        lower estimate of residual value than was originally recorded, PPL Energy
        Supply
        is required to determine whether the decline is other than temporary. If
        it is
        other than temporary, the residual value will be revised using the new estimate.
        This reduction in the residual value will be recognized as a loss in the
        period
        in which the estimate was changed. If the review provides a higher estimate
        of
        residual value than was originally recorded, no adjustment will be
        made.

In
        testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
        assumptions to estimate: future cash flows; the useful lives of the leased
        assets; the fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
        assets.
        Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in significantly different
        outcomes than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.
        PPL
        Energy Supply used discounted cash flow to determine the estimated fair value
        of
        the leased assets at the end of the lease term.

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain
        leased assets. This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes to the
        residual value. PPL Energy Supply's estimate was based on using projections
        of
        electric and fuel prices and any firm sale and purchase agreements. An increase
        of the discount rate by 25 basis points or a 10% reduction in the forecasted
        cash flows would have resulted in a reduction of the residual value of these
        leased assets of $1 million and $6 million, if it was determined that the
        reduction was other than temporary.

Leasing

PPL
        Energy Supply applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases,"
        to all
        leasing transactions. In addition, PPL Energy Supply applies the provisions
        of
        numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the EITF
        that
        provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting
        for
        various leasing arrangements. In general, there are two types of leases from
        a
        lessee's perspective: operating leases (leases accounted for off-balance
        sheet);
        and capital leases (leases capitalized on the balance sheet).

In
        accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
        discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
        useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating
        or
        capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
        whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease,
        thus
        significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
        statements.

In
        addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
        transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex
        when
        they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
        accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
        assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment
        for
        book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
        and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply continued to participate in a significant
        sale/leaseback transaction. In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in
        the
        Colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back
        to
        PPL Montana under four 36-year leases. This transaction is accounted for
        as an
        operating lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements related
        to
        sale/leaseback arrangements. If for any reason this transaction did not meet
        the
        requirements for off-balance sheet operating lease treatment as a
        sale/leaseback, PPL Energy Supply would have recorded approximately $250
        million
        of additional assets and approximately $305 million of additional liabilities
        on
        its balance sheet at December 31, 2006, and would have recorded additional
        expenses currently estimated at $7 million, after-tax, in 2006.

See
        Note
        11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
        leases.

Loss
        Accruals

PPL
        Energy Supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
        conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. PPL
        Energy
        Supply's accounting for such events is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting
        for
        Contingencies," and other related accounting guidance. SFAS 5 defines a
        contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances
        involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will
        ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
        occur."

For
        loss
        contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
        indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
        of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
        estimated. The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event
        or
        events are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies
        that might result in gains. PPL Energy Supply continuously assesses potential
        loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income
        taxes, regulatory penalties and other events.

PPL
        Energy Supply also has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase
        commitments when significant events have occurred. For example, estimated
        losses
        were accrued when long-term purchase commitments were assumed under asset
        acquisition agreements and

when
        PPL
        Electric's generation business was deregulated. Under regulatory accounting,
        PPL
        Electric recorded the above-market cost of energy purchases from NUGs as
        part of
        its purchased power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs were
        recovered in regulated rates. When the generation business was deregulated,
        the
        estimated loss associated with these long-term purchase commitments to make
        above-market NUG purchases was recorded because PPL Electric was committed
        to
        purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover
        these
        costs in regulated rates. As described below, this loss accrual was transferred
        to PPL EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000, corporate realignment. PPL Energy
        Supply's considers these losses to be similar to an asset impairment or
        inventory write-downs.

The
        accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
        identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
        events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
        as
        to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
        of
        accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL Energy Supply's
        management.

Initial
        Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
        Energy Supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers,
        tax specialists and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability
        that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Significant
        loss accruals were initially recorded in 2005 and 2006. One involved the
        accrual
        of remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the Martins
        Creek generating station. Another was the loss accrual related to the PJM
        billing dispute. Significant judgment was required by PPL's and PPL Energy
        Supply's management to perform the initial assessment of these
        contingencies.

See
        Note
        15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on both of these
        contingencies.

PPL
        Energy Supply has identified certain other events that could give rise to
        a
        loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS
        requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is
        "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred. The FASB defines
        "reasonably possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or
        events occurring is more than remote but less than likely." See Note 15 to
        the
        Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies
        that
        have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS 5.

Reducing
        Recorded Loss Accruals

When
        an
        estimated loss is accrued, PPL Energy Supply identifies, where applicable,
        the
        triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering
        events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
        loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.
        The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
        of certain recorded loss accruals:

The
        largest loss accrual on PPL Energy Supply's balance sheet, and the loss accrual
        that changed most significantly in 2006, was for an impairment of above-market
        NUG purchase commitments. This loss accrual reflects the estimated difference
        between the above-market contract terms, under the purchase commitments,
        and the
        expected fair value of the electricity to be purchased at the date these
        contracts were impaired. This loss accrual was originally recorded at $879
        million in 1998, when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.

When
        the
        loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
        established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced.
        A
        schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases
        over the lives of the NUG contracts. This loss accrual was transferred to
        PPL
        EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000 corporate realignment. PPL EnergyPlus continues
        to reduce the above-market NUG liability based on the aforementioned schedule.
        As PPL EnergyPlus reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases,
        it
        offsets the actual cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power
        purchase expense more in line with expected market prices. The above-market
        loss
        accrual was $136 million at December 31, 2006. This loss accrual will be
        significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts expires.
        The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in 2014.

Ongoing
        Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
        Energy Supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that
        the
        recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing
        communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
        tax specialists, operation management and other parties.

As
        part
        of the year-end preparation of its 2005 financial statements, PPL Energy
        Supply's management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the ash basin
        leak
        at Martins Creek, described above under "Initial Identification and Recording
        of
        the Loss Accrual." Based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications
        with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies, PPL Energy Supply's
        management concluded that $48 million was the best estimate of the cost of
        the
        remediation effort.

In
        2006,
        PPL Energy Supply reduced the estimate of costs to $37 million, primarily
        due to
        an insurance claim settlement. This amount represents management's best estimate
        of the probable loss associated with the Martins Creek ash basin leak. At
        December 31, 2006, the remaining contingency for this remediation was $9
        million. PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the final cost of the remediation,
        the
        outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania DEP, the outcome of the
        natural resource damage assessment, the outcome of the lawsuit brought by
        the
        citizens and businesses and the exact nature of any other regulatory or other
        legal actions that may be initiated against PPL Energy Supply as a result
        of the
        disposal basin leak. PPL Energy Supply also cannot predict with certainty
        the
        extent of the fines or damages that may be sought in connection with any
        such
        actions or the ultimate financial impact on PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy
        Supply's management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this
        contingency in future periods.

Income
        Tax Uncertainties

Significant
        management judgment is required in developing PPL Energy Supply's contingencies,
        or reserves, for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.
        The ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in
        management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each
        tax
        year. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay
        assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by
        taxing
        authorities. However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues
        raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In evaluating
        the
        exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL Energy Supply accounts
        for changes in probable exposures based on management's best estimate of
        the
        amount of benefit that should be recognized in the financial statements.
        An
        allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies, the balance of which
        management believes to be adequate. The ongoing assessment of valuation
        allowances is based on an assessment of whether deferred tax assets will
        ultimately be realized. Management considers a number of factors in assessing
        the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets, including forecasts of taxable
        income in future periods.

In
        June
        2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
        an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." PPL Energy Supply adopted FIN
        effective January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 alters the methodology
        PPL
        Energy Supply currently uses to account for income tax uncertainties. Effective
        with the adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax positions are no longer considered
        to
        be contingencies assessed in accordance with SFAS 5. See Note 23 to the
        Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of FIN 48 and for
        information regarding the expected impact of adoption.

6)

Asset
        Retirement Obligations

SFAS
        143,
        "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
        associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
        liability in the financial statements. The initial obligation should be measured
        at the estimated fair value. An equivalent amount should be recorded as an
        increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over
        the
        useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability
        should
        be increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income
        statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of
        time.

FIN
        47,
        "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation
        of
        FASB Statement No. 143," clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS
        143.
        FIN 47 specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred
        if the
        fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
        determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates
        to
        calculate fair value. Fair value is developed through consideration of estimated
        retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated
        retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred.
        Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of
        the
        fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those
        identified and recorded in the financial statements. Changes in ARO costs
        and
        settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various AROs and the
        related assets, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes
        are incorporated into the latest estimate of the obligations.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply had AROs totaling $336 million recorded
        on
        the Balance Sheet. Of this amount, $276 million or 82% relates to PPL Energy
        Supply's nuclear decommissioning ARO. PPL Energy Supply's most significant
        assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount
        rates and the inflation rates. A variance in the forecasted retirement costs,
        the discount rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact
        on the
        ARO liabilities.

The
        following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear
        decommissioning ARO liability at PPL Energy Supply as of December 31, 2006,
        associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial
        recognition. There is no significant change to the annual depreciation expense
        of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as
        a
        result of changing the assumptions. Each sensitivity below reflects an
        evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
        assumption.

ITEM
        7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF
        OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
        Electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central
        Pennsylvania. Its headquarters are in Allentown, PA. See "Item 1. Business
        -
        Background," for a description of PPL Electric's business. PPL Electric's
        strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery
        business while maintaining high standards of customer service and reliability
        in
        a cost-effective manner.

PPL
        Electric's electricity delivery business is rate-regulated. Accordingly,
        this
        business is subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may
        recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates.
        PPL
        Electric's PLR obligation and the associated recovery from customers of its
        energy supply costs after 2009, when PPL Electric's full requirements energy
        supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus expire, will be determined by the PUC
        pursuant to rules that have not yet been promulgated. To address this risk,
        PPL
        Electric has filed a plan with the PUC detailing how it proposes to acquire
        its
        electricity supply for non-shopping customers after 2009. In February 2007,
        a
        PUC Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended decision approving PPL
        Electric's plan with minor modifications. PPL Electric cannot predict when
        the
        PUC will act on the recommended decision or what action it will take. Also,
        in
        February 2007, the PUC issued proposed PLR regulations and a policy statement
        regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. The PUC
        is
        requesting public comment on both the regulations and policy statement. At
        current forward market prices, PPL Electric currently estimates that customer
        rates could increase by about 20% in 2010.

A
        key
        challenge for PPL Electric is to maintain a strong credit profile. Investors,
        analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry
        continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these
        companies. PPL Electric continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate
        capital structure and liquidity position, thereby managing its target credit
        profile.

See
        "Item
        1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning material risks PPL Electric
        faces in its business.

The
        purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Electric's
        past
        and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and challenges

PPL
        Electric's earnings beyond 2006 are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
        See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this
        Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks,
        uncertainties and factors that may impact PPL Electric's future
        earnings.

        Outlook

PPL
        Electric expects to have flat earnings in 2007 compared with 2006, with modest
        load growth being offset by increased operation and maintenance expenses.

In
        late
        March 2007, PPL Electric expects to file a request with the PUC seeking an
        increase in its distribution rates beginning in January 2008.

Retail

The
        increases in revenues from retail electric operations were attributable
        to:

                  vs. 2005

                  vs. 2004

The
        increases in revenues from retail electric operations for 2006 compared with
        2005 were primarily due to increased PLR revenues resulting from an 8.4%
        rate
        increase, offset by a decrease in electric delivery revenues resulting from
        a
        decrease in sales volumes due in part to milder weather in 2006.

The
        increases in revenues from retail electric operations for 2005 compared with
        2004 were primarily due to:

·

higher
                  electric delivery revenues resulting from higher transmission and
                  distribution customer rates effective January 1, 2005, and a 4.3%
                  increase in sales volume; and

·

higher
                  PLR revenues due to a 2% rate increase and a 6% increase in sales
                  volume,
                  in part due to the return of customers previously served by alternate
                  suppliers.

Wholesale
        Electric to Affiliate

PPL
        Electric has a contract to sell to PPL EnergyPlus the electricity that PPL
        Electric purchases under contracts with NUGs. The $9 million increase in
        wholesale revenue to affiliate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due
        to
        an unplanned outage at a NUG facility in 2005. PPL Electric therefore had
        more
        electricity to sell to PPL EnergyPlus in 2006.

The
        $6
        million decrease in wholesale revenue to affiliate in 2005 compared with
        was also primarily due to the unplanned outage at a NUG facility in 2005.

Energy
        Purchases

Energy
        purchases decreased by $81 million for 2006 compared with 2005 primarily
        due to
        the $39 million loss accrual for the PJM billing dispute recorded in 2005
        and
        the $28 million reduction of that accrual recorded in December 2006. See
        Note 15
        to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the PJM
        billing
        dispute. Also, the decrease reflects $14 million in lower ancillary costs
        and a
        reduction of $8 million resulting from the elimination of a charge to
        load-serving entities, which minimized the impacts of integrating into the
        Midwest ISO and PJM markets, contributed to the decrease. These decreases
        were
        partially offset by a $7 million increase due to an unplanned NUG outage
        in
        2005.

Energy
        purchases increased by $49 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due
        to
        the $39 million accrual for the PJM billing dispute. Also, the increase reflects
        a $6 million increase in ancillary costs and a $10 million charge to
        load-serving entities which began in May 2005, retroactive to December 2004.
        This charge minimized the revenue impacts to transmission owners that resulted
        from the integration of the Midwest ISO and PJM markets and continued until
        March 2006. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease
        due
        to an unplanned NUG outage in 2005.

Energy
        Purchases from Affiliate

Energy
        purchases from affiliate increased by $118 million in 2006 compared with
        2005.
        The increase is primarily the result of an 8.4% increase in prices for energy
        purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus needed to
        support
        PLR load, offset by a slight decrease in that load.

Energy
        purchases from affiliate increased by $90 million in 2005 compared with 2004.
        The increase reflects an increase in PLR load, as well as higher prices for
        energy purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus that
        was
        needed to support the PLR load.

Other
        Operation and Maintenance

For
        the
        year ended 2006, PPL Electric's other operation and maintenance expense was
        reduced by a $36 million pre-tax one-time credit in connection with the
        realization of benefits related to the ability to use excess Black Lung Trust
        assets to make future benefit payments for retired miners' medical benefits.
        See
        Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Excluding
        this one-time credit, the increases in other operation and maintenance expenses
        were due to:

                  vs. 2005

                  vs. 2004

Depreciation

Depreciation
        increased by $6 million in 2006 compared with 2005 and by $5 million in 2005
        compared with 2004 primarily due to plant additions. 2006 compared with 2005
        was
        impacted by the purchase of equipment previously leased. See Note 11 to the
        Financial Statements for additional information. 2005 compared with 2004
        was
        impacted by the Automated Meter Reading project.

Taxes,
        Other Than Income

A
        $7
        million increase in gross receipts tax expense, offset by a $2 million decrease
        in real estate tax expense, are the primary reasons for the $4 million increase
        in taxes, other than income, in 2006 compared with 2005.

In
        2004,
        PPL Electric reversed a $14 million accrued liability for 1998 and 1999 PURTA
        taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings
        regarding the Susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment. The rights of
        third-party intervenors to further appeal expired in 2004. The reversal and
        a
        $19 million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense in 2005 are the
        primary reasons for the $33 million increase in taxes, other than income
        in
        2005, compared with 2004.

Financial
        Condition

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

PPL
        Electric is focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and
        strengthening its balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit
        profile. PPL Electric believes that its cash on hand, short-term investments,
        operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing
        capacity, taken as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing
        operating requirements, future security maturities and estimated future capital
        expenditures. PPL Electric currently expects cash, cash equivalents and
        short-term investments at the end of 2007 to be less than $100 million, while
        maintaining approximately $200 million in credit facility capacity and up
        to
        $150 million in short-term debt capacity related to an asset-backed commercial
        paper program. However, PPL Electric's cash flows from operations and its
        access
        to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and
        uncertainties, including but not limited to:

Operating
        Activities

PPL
        Electric's cash provided by operating activities remained flat in 2006 compared
        with 2005. Except for the items explained below, there were no other significant
        changes in the components of PPL Electric's cash provided by operating
        activities. Domestic retail electric revenues increased as a result of an
        8.4%
        increase in PLR sales prices in 2006, but were partially offset by a decrease
        in
        domestic delivery revenues resulting from a decrease in sales volumes, due
        in
        part to milder weather in 2006. The net increase from revenues was offset
        by
        energy purchases PPL Electric made from PPL EnergyPlus under the PLR contracts.
        PPL Electric purchased less energy under the PLR contracts in 2006 but incurred
        a scheduled 8.4% increase in the price it pays under such
        contracts.

Net
        cash
        provided by operating activities decreased by $318 million in 2005 compared
        with
        2004, primarily as a result of receipts in 2004 of $300 million in cash
        collateral related to the PLR energy supply agreements and a federal income
        tax
        refund in 2004. The decrease for 2005 compared with 2004 was partially mitigated
        by the 7.1% increase in distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries
        effective January 1, 2005.

An
        important element supporting the stability of PPL Electric's cash from
        operations is its long-term purchase contracts with PPL EnergyPlus. These
        contracts provide sufficient energy for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
        through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge
        its
        customers over this period. These contracts require cash collateral or other
        credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire
        contract through cash settlement, in the event of adverse changes in market
        prices. Also under the contracts, PPL Energy Supply may request cash collateral
        or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of
        the
        entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of PPL
        Electric's credit ratings. The maximum amount that PPL Electric would have
        to
        post under these contracts is $300 million, and PPL Electric estimates that
        it
        would not have had to post any collateral if energy prices decreased by 10%
        from
        year-end 2006 or 2005 levels.

Investing
        Activities

The
        primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures. See
        "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2006
        and
        projected expenditures for the years 2007 through 2011.

Net
        cash
        used in investing activities increased by $94 million in 2006 compared with
        2005, primarily as a result of an increase of $115 million in capital
        expenditures, of which $52 million related to the purchase of leased equipment.
        See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the purchase
        of leased equipment in connection with the termination of the related master
        lease agreements.

Net
        cash
        used in investing activities decreased by $330 million in 2005 compared with
        2004, primarily as a result of initiating a $300 million demand loan to an
        affiliate in 2004.

Financing
        Activities

Net
        cash
        used in financing activities increased $199 million in 2006 compared with
        2005,
        primarily as a result of the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from
        PPL, an increase of $298 million in net debt retirements and an increase
        of $23
        million in dividends paid to PPL, partially offset by net proceeds of $245
        million from the issuance of preference stock and a $75 million contribution
        from PPL. A portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the preference
        stock was used to fund the repurchase of common stock from PPL. See Note
        7 to
        the Financial Statements for details regarding the preference stock. PPL
        Electric did not issue any long-term debt in 2006. See Note 8 to the Financial
        Statements for more detailed information regarding PPL Electric's debt
        retirements during 2006.

Net
        cash
        used in financing activities decreased by $146 million in 2005 compared with
        2004, primarily due to a decrease of $217 million in net debt retirements,
        partially offset by an increase of $69 million in dividends paid to PPL.

See
        "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans to
        issue
        debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity
        available to PPL Electric. Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion
        of PPL Electric's plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred securities,
        as well as maturities of PPL Electric's long-term debt.

Forecasted
        Sources of Cash

PPL
        Electric expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
        in
        the near term, including a credit facility, a commercial paper program and
        an
        asset-backed commercial paper program. PPL Electric also expects to continue
        to
        have access to debt and equity capital markets, as necessary, for its long-term
        financing needs.

Credit
        Facility

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric's total committed borrowing capacity under
        its
        credit facility and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

Borrowings
                  under PPL Electric's credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based
                  rates
                  plus a spread, depending upon the company's public debt rating.
                  PPL
                  Electric also has the capability to cause the lenders to issue
                  up to $200
                  million of letters of credit under this facility, which issuances
                  reduce
                  available borrowing capacity.

The
                  credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring debt to
                  total
                  capitalization to not exceed 70%. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
                  PPL
                  Electric's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages,
                  as
                  calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were 48% and
                  55%. The
                  credit facility also contains standard representations and warranties
                  that
                  must be made for PPL Electric to borrow under it.

(b)

PPL
                  Electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters
                  of
                  credit are drawn upon.

In
        addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit
        agreement contains various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants
        beyond
        applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
        and/or termination of the agreement. PPL Electric monitors the covenants
        on a
        regular basis. At December 31, 2006, PPL Electric was in material compliance
        with these covenants. At this time PPL Electric believes that these covenants
        and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to this funding source.
        PPL
        Electric intends to renew and extend its $200 million credit facility in
        2007.

Commercial
        Paper

PPL
        Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
        it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
        if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by the $200
        million credit facility of PPL Electric. PPL Electric had no commercial paper
        outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. During 2007, PPL Electric may
        issue commercial paper from time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow
        needs.

Asset-Backed
        Commercial Paper Program

PPL
        Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through
        which
        PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
        receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary
        on
        an ongoing basis. The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of
        up to
        an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by
        a
        financial institution. PPL Electric uses the proceeds from the program for
        general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of credit. At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the loan balance outstanding was $42 million,
        all of
        which was used to cash collateralize letters of credit. See Note 8 to the
        Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial
        paper
        program.

Long-Term
        Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
        to market conditions in 2007, PPL Electric currently plans to issue up to
        $300
        million in long-term debt securities. PPL Electric expects to use the proceeds
        to fund a maturity of existing debt and for general corporate purposes. PPL
        Electric currently does not plan to issue any equity securities in
        2007.

Forecasted
        Uses of Cash

In
        addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
        purchased power, payroll, and taxes, PPL Electric currently expects to incur
        future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations
        and payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities.

The
        table

PPL
        Electric's capital expenditure projections for the years 2007-2011 total
        approximately $1.5 billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically
        to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
        conditions.

PPL
        Electric plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2007 with cash
        on hand
        and cash from operations.

Contractual
        Obligations

PPL
        Electric has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the
        ordinary course of conducting its business. At December 31, 2006, the estimated
        contractual cash obligations of PPL Electric were:

                  made
                  in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts
                  presented.

Dividends

From
        time
        to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Electric pays dividends
        on
        its common stock to its parent, PPL, which uses the dividends for general
        corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs. As discussed in
        Note
        7 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric may not pay dividends on its
        common
        stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends have been paid
        on
        the 6.25% Series Preference Stock for the then-current dividend period. PPL
        Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
        preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

PPL
        Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments
        in the
        event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to
        comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation
        and
        Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other subsidiaries.
        PPL
        Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would
        significantly impact its ability to declare dividends.

Credit
        Ratings

Moody's,
        S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
        preferred securities of PPL Electric and PPL Transition Bond Company. Based
        on
        their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain
        ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A
        credit
        rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
        associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit
        ratings of PPL Electric and PPL Transition Bond Company are based on information
        provided by PPL Electric and other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and
        Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL
        Electric or PPL Transition Bond Company. Such ratings may be subject to
        revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated
        independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to
        their
        securities. A downgrade in PPL Electric's or PPL Transition Bond Company's
        credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access
        to
        capital markets.

        2006, Moody's upgraded the issuer rating of PPL Electric to Baa1 from Baa2,
        upgraded the ratings of its First Mortgage Bonds and Senior Secured Bonds
        to A3
        from Baa1 and upgraded the rating of its preferred stock to Baa3 from Ba1.

In
        connection with PPL Electric's issuance of preference stock in April 2006,
        S&P affirmed all of PPL Electric's credit ratings.

In
        August
        2006, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook for PPL
        Electric.

In
        November 2006, S&P completed its annual review of its credit ratings for PPL
        Electric. At that time, S&P affirmed its credit ratings and stable outlook
        for PPL Electric.

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements

PPL
        Electric has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the
        scope
        of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
        Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation
        of
        FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation

Commodity
        Price Risk - PLR Contracts

PPL
        Electric and PPL EnergyPlus have power supply agreements under which PPL
        EnergyPlus sells to PPL Electric (under a predetermined pricing arrangement)
        energy and capacity to fulfill PPL Electric's PLR obligation through 2009.
        As a
        result, PPL Electric has shifted any electric price risk relating to its
        PLR
        obligation to PPL EnergyPlus through 2009. See Note 16 to the Financial
        Statements for information on the PLR contracts.

Interest
        Rate Risk

PPL
        Electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which increases its interest
        rate risk. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, PPL Electric's potential annual
        exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest
        rates, was not significant.

PPL
        Electric is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio.
        At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric estimated that its potential exposure to
        a
        change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement
        in interest rates, was $37 million, compared with $43 million at December
        31,
        2005.

Related
        Party Transactions

PPL
        Electric is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating
        responsibility by senior management of PPL Electric in outside partnerships,
        including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other
        entities doing business with PPL Electric.

        23 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards
        recently adopted or pending adoption.

Application
        of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL
        Electric's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by
        the
        methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
        accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly
        important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL Electric,
        and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain.
        Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting
        policies could result in a significant change to the information presented
        in
        the Financial Statements. (These accounting policies are also discussed in
        Note
        1 to the Financial Statements.) PPL's senior management has reviewed these
        critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them,
        with its Audit Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed
        the
        following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting
        policies with the Audit Committee.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Among
        other
        things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework
        for
        measuring fair value. PPL Electric must adopt SFAS 157 no later than January
        1,
        2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 is expected to impact the fair value component
        of
        PPL Electric's critical accounting policy related to "Pension and Other
        Postretirement Benefits." See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for additional
        information regarding SFAS 157.

1)

Pension
        and Other Postretirement Benefits

As
        described in Note 13 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric participates
        in,
        and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic
        pension
        and other postretirement costs of plans sponsored by PPL Services based on
        participation in those plans. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers'
        Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
        Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these
        benefits. In addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement date
        provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
        and
        Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31, 2006. See Note 13 to
        the
        Financial Statements for further details. Under these accounting standards,
        assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and
        performance of plan assets. Delayed recognition in earnings of differences
        between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle
        of these standards. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for
        a
        smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who
        benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are:

In
        selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement
        plans, PPL starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream
        for
        its plans. This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.
        A
        portfolio of over 500 Moody's Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with
        make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
        $370
        billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
        yields
        are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve. The results of this analysis
        are considered in conjunction with other economic data and consideration
        of
        movements in the Moody's Aa bond index to determine the discount rate
        assumption. At December 31, 2006, PPL increased the discount rate for its
        domestic plans from 5.70% to 5.94%.

In
        selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
        past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held
        by the
        plans. At December 31, 2006, PPL's expected return on plan assets remained
        at
        8.50% for its domestic pension plans and decreased to 7.75% from 8.00% for
        its
        other postretirement benefit plans.

In
        selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience
        in
        light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2006, PPL's rate of
        compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic plans.

In
        selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
        forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2006, PPL's health care
        cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2007, gradually declining to 5.5% for
        2012.

A
        variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact
        on the
        accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported
        annual
        net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost allocated to PPL
        Electric. The following chart reflects the sensitivities in the 2006 financial
        statements associated with a change in certain assumptions based on PPL's
        primary pension and other postretirement plans. While the chart below reflects
        either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change
        would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities
        and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit
        cost
        by a similar amount in the opposite direction. Each sensitivity below reflects
        an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and
        does
        not include income tax effects.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric's Balance Sheet reflected a net liability
        of
        $133 million for pension and other postretirement benefits allocated from
        plans
        sponsored by PPL Services.

In

        charged to operating expense of $15 million. This amount represents a $4
        million
        increase compared with the charge recognized during 2005. This increase was
        primarily due to updated demographic assumptions, primarily due to updating
        the
        mortality table used to measure obligation and cost.

Loss
        Accruals

PPL
        Electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
        conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. PPL
        Electric's accounting for such events is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting
        for
        Contingencies," and other related accounting guidance. SFAS 5 defines a
        contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances
        involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will
        ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
        occur."

For
        loss
        contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
        indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
        of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
        estimated. The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event
        or
        events are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies
        that might result in gains. PPL Electric continuously assesses potential
        loss
        contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income taxes,
        regulatory penalties and other events.

The
        accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
        identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
        events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
        as
        to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
        of
        accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL Electric's
        management.

Initial
        Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
        Electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers,
        tax
        specialists and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability
        that
        a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In
        2005,
        a significant loss accrual was initially recorded for the PJM billing dispute.
        Significant judgment was required by PPL Electric's management to perform
        the
        initial assessment of this contingency. In 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf
        of its subsidiary, PECO Energy, Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM
        and
        PPL Electric with the FERC, alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April
        1998 through May 2003 as a result of an error by PJM. The complaint requested
        the FERC, among other things, to direct PPL Electric to refund to PJM $39
        million, plus interest of $8 million, and for PJM to refund these same amounts
        to PECO. In April 2005, the FERC issued an Order Establishing Hearing and
        Settlement Judge Proceedings (the Order). In the Order, the FERC determined
        that
        PECO was entitled to reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges
        that
        PECO asserted PJM erroneously billed. The FERC ordered settlement discussions,
        before a judge, to determine the amount of the overcharge to PECO and the
        parties responsible for reimbursement to PECO.

Based
        on
        an evaluation of the FERC Order, PPL Electric's management concluded that
        it was
        probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the PJM billing
        dispute. PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual of $47 million, the amount
        of
        PECO's claim, in the first quarter of 2005. See Note 15 to the Financial
        Statements for additional information.

See
        "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a discussion of the year-end
        assessments of this contingency.

PPL
        Electric has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss,
        but
        that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS 5 requires
        disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably
        possible" that a loss has been incurred. The FASB defines "reasonably possible"
        as cases in which "the chance of the future event or events occurring is
        more
        than remote but less than likely." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements
        for
        disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria
        for accrual under SFAS 5.

Reducing
        Recorded Loss Accruals

When
        an
        estimated loss is accrued, PPL Electric identifies, where applicable, the
        triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering
        events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
        loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.
        The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
        of certain recorded loss accruals:

Ongoing
        Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
        Electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
        recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing
        communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
        tax specialists, operation management and other parties.

As
        part
        of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL Electric's
        management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the PJM billing dispute,
        described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
        Accrual." See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

In
        March
        2006, the FERC rejected the proposed settlement agreement that was filed
        with
        the FERC in September 2005. Subsequently, in March 2006, PPL Electric and
        Exelon
        filed with the FERC a new proposed settlement agreement. In November 2006,
        the
        FERC entered an order accepting the March 2006 proposed settlement agreement,
        upon the condition that PPL Electric agree to certain modifications. In December
        2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC a modified offer of settlement
        (Compliance Filing). Under the Compliance Filing, which must be approved
        by the
        FERC, PPL Electric would make a single payment through its monthly PJM bill
        of
        $38 million, plus interest through the date of payment, and PJM would include
        a
        single credit for this amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill. Through December
        31,
        2006, the estimated interest on this payment would be $4 million, for a total
        payment of $42 million. As a result, PPL Electric reduced the recorded loss
        accrual to $42 million at December 31, 2006. Based on the terms of the latest
        settlement agreement and the effective date and provisions of power supply
        agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, PPL has determined that
        PPL
        Electric is responsible for the claims prior to July 1, 2000 (totaling $12
        million), and that PPL EnergyPlus is responsible for the claims subsequent
        to
        that date (totaling $30 million). Therefore, PPL Electric recorded a receivable
        from PPL EnergyPlus of $30 million at December 31, 2006, for the portion of
        claims allocated to PPL EnergyPlus. As a result of the reduction of the loss
        accrual and allocation to PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric recorded credits to
        expense of $35 million, including $28 million of "Energy purchases" and $7
        million of "Interest Expense" on the Statement of Income. PPL Electric's
        management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency
        in
        future periods.

Income
        Tax Uncertainties

Significant
        management judgment is required in developing PPL Electric's contingencies,
        or
        reserves, for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.
        The
        ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management's
        best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year. Annual
        tax
        provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
        may
        result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities.
        However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised
        by such
        authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In evaluating the exposure
        associated with various filing positions, PPL Electric accounts for changes
        in
        probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount of benefit
        that should be recognized in the financial statements. An allowance is
        maintained for the tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes
        to be adequate. The ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on
        an
        assessment of whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized.
        Management considers a number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization
        of deferred tax assets, including forecasts of taxable income in future periods.

In
        June
        2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
        an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." PPL Electric adopted FIN 48 effective
        January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 alters the methodology PPL Electric
        currently uses to account for income tax uncertainties. Effective with the
        adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to be
        contingencies under SFAS 5. See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for a
        more
        detailed discussion of FIN 48 and for information regarding the expected
        impact
        of adoption.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and statement of long-term
        debt of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006, and the
        related consolidated statements of income, shareowners

'
        common
        equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended. 
Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the year ended
        December 31, 2006 listed in the accompanying Index to Item 15(a). These
        financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
        management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
        statements and schedule based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of PPL Corporation
        and
        subsidiaries at December 31, 2006, and the consolidated results of their
        operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, in
        conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
        opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the year ended December
        31, 2006, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
        as
        a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
        therein.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation:

We
        have
        audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that PPL Corporation
        maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
        31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
        issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (the COSO criteria). PPL Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining
        effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
        of
        the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
        responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an
        opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial
        reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
        to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
        over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management's assessment that PPL Corporation maintained effective
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
        stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
        opinion, PPL Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
        internal control over financial reporting as of

December
        31, 2006, based on

the
        COSO
        criteria

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet and statement
        of
        long-term debt as of December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated statements
        of income, shareowners' common equity and comprehensive income, and cash
        flows
        for the year then ended of PPL Corporation and our report dated February
        26,
        2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

based

on our
          audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
          the
          standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
          Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
          assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
          misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
          test
          basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates

of
        PPL
        Energy Supply, LLC:

We
        have
        audited the consolidated balance sheet and statement of long-term debt of

        statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
        management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
        statements and schedule based on our audit.

We

To
        the
        Board of Managers and Sole Member

of
        PPL
        Energy Supply, LLC:

In
          our
          opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
          index
          present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PPL
          Energy
          Supply, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2005, and the
          results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years
          in
          the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
          generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
          opinion,
          the financial statement schedule, "Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying
          Accounts and Reserves" for the two years ended December 31, 2005, listed
          in the
          accompanying index

presents
          fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
          read in
          conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
          statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
          Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
          financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
          We
          conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards
          of the
          Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
          require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
          about
          whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
          audit
          includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
          disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
          used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
          financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
          reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareowner

of
        PPL
        Electric Utilities Corporation:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and statement of long-term
        debt of PPL Electric Utilities Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
        31,
        2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners

'
        equity,
        and cash flows for the year then ended.  Our audit also included the
        financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2006 listed
        in the
        accompanying Index to Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule
        are
        the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
        express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
        audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of PPL Electric Utilities
        Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006, and the consolidated results
        of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31,
        2006,
        in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
        our
        opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the year ended December
        31, 2006, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
        as
        a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
        therein.

As
        discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company

Summary
        of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Business
        and Consolidation

(PPL)

PPL
        is an
        energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily
        engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in the northeastern
        and
        western U.S. and in the delivery of electricity in Pennsylvania, the U.K.
        and
        Latin America. Based in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal direct subsidiaries
        are
        PPL Energy Funding, PPL Electric, PPL Gas Utilities, PPL Services and PPL
        Capital Funding.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        Energy Funding is the parent of PPL Energy Supply, which serves as the holding
        company for PPL's principal unregulated subsidiaries. PPL Energy Supply is
        the
        parent of PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Global.

PPL
        Generation owns and operates a portfolio of domestic power generating assets.
        These power plants are located in Pennsylvania, Montana, Illinois, Connecticut,
        New York and Maine and use well-diversified fuel sources including coal,
        uranium, natural gas, oil and water. PPL EnergyPlus markets or brokers
        electricity produced by PPL Generation, along with purchased power, natural
        gas
        and oil, in competitive wholesale and deregulated retail markets, primarily
        in
        the northeastern and western portions of the U.S. PPL Global owns and operates
        international energy businesses that are primarily focused on the distribution
        of electricity.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric is a rate-regulated subsidiary of PPL. PPL Electric's principal
        businesses are the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve
        retail
        customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania,
        and
        the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a
        PLR.

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
        consolidated financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
        include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities
        in
        which the company has a controlling financial interest. (See Note 22 for
        additional information regarding the consolidation and deconsolidation of
        variable interest entities.) Investments in entities in which the company
        has
        the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling
        financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. See Note 3
        for
        further discussion. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value.
        All
        significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Any minority
        interests are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

It
        is the
        policy of PPL and PPL Energy Supply to consolidate foreign subsidiaries on
        a
        one-month lag and record earnings from foreign equity method investments
        on a
        three-month lag, based on the availability of financial data on a U.S. GAAP
        basis. Material intervening events, such as debt issuances and retirements,
        acquisitions or divestitures, that occur in the lag period are recognized
        in the
        current Financial Statements, while significant but not material events are
        only
        disclosed.

In
        June
        2004, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries purchased the Sundance and University
        Park
        generation assets from the lessor. Prior to the purchase of the assets, PPL's
        and PPL Energy Supply's consolidated financial statements included the accounts
        of this lessor in accordance with FIN 46(R). See Note 22 for further discussion.
        In May 2005, a subsidiary of PPL Generation completed the sale of its Sundance
        generation assets to Arizona Public Service Company. See Note 9 for further
        discussion.

The
        consolidated financial statements of PPL and PPL Energy Supply include their
        share of undivided interests in jointly-owned facilities, as well as their
        share
        of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 14 for additional
        information.

Regulation

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric and PPL Gas Utilities account for regulated operations in accordance
        with the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
        of
        Regulation," which requires rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects
        of
        regulatory decisions in their financial statements.

The
        following regulatory assets were included in the "Regulatory and Other
        Noncurrent Assets" section of the Balance Sheets at December 31.

The
        recoverable transition costs are the result of the PUC Final Order, which
        allowed PPL Electric to begin amortizing its competitive transition (or
        stranded) costs, $2.97 billion, over an 11-year transition period effective
        January 1, 1999. In August 1999, competitive transition costs of $2.4
        billion were converted to intangible transition costs when they were securitized
        by the issuance of transition bonds. The intangible transition costs are
        being
        amortized over the life of the transition bonds, through December 2008, in
        accordance with an amortization schedule filed with the PUC. The assets of
        PPL
        Transition Bond Company, including the intangible transition property, are
        not
        available to creditors of PPL or PPL Electric. The transition bonds are
        obligations of PPL Transition Bond Company and are non-recourse to PPL and
        PPL
        Electric. The remaining competitive transition costs are also being amortized
        based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the PUC, adjusted
        for
        those competitive transition costs that were converted to intangible transition
        costs. As a result of the conversion of a significant portion of the competitive
        transition costs into intangible transition costs, amortization of substantially
        all of the remaining competitive transition costs will occur in
        2009.

Taxes
        recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes
        that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory
        practices. Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting
        deferred tax liability is recognized. In accordance with SFAS 109, "Accounting
        for Income Taxes," this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are
        not
        offset for general-purpose financial reporting; rather, each is displayed
        separately. Because this regulatory asset does not represent cash tax
        expenditures already incurred by PPL, this regulatory asset is not earning
        a
        current return. This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the
        period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual
        cash taxes are incurred.

On
        December 31, 2006, PPL and PPL Electric established regulatory assets for
        recoverable costs of defined benefit plans as a result of the adoption of
        SFAS
        158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
        Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." These
        regulatory assets do not represent cash expenditures already incurred;
        consequently, these assets are not earning a current return. These regulatory
        assets represent the costs that would have otherwise been recorded in other
        comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS 158, as follows:

Recoverable
                  costs of defined benefit plans

$


$


Of
        these
        costs, $16 million are expected to be amortized into net periodic benefit
        cost
        in 2007. All costs will be amortized over the lives of the defined benefit
        plans. See Note 13 for the disclosures related to the adoption of SFAS
        158.

In
        January 2005, severe ice storms hit PPL Electric's service territory. The
        total
        cost of restoring service, excluding capitalized cost and regular payroll
        expenses, was $16 million. In August 2005, the PUC issued an order granting
        PPL
        Electric's petition for authority to defer and amortize for regulatory
        accounting and reporting purposes a portion of these storm costs subject
        to
        certain conditions. As a result of the PUC Order and in accordance with SFAS
        71,
        PPL Electric deferred $12 million of its previously expensed storm costs.
        The
        ratemaking treatment of these costs will be addressed in PPL Electric's next
        distribution base rate case, which is expected to be filed in late March
        2007.
        PPL and PPL Electric believe that recovery of the remaining portion of these
        costs is probable.

In
        August
        2006, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania overturned the PUC's decision
        of
        December 2004 that previously allowed PPL Electric to recover, over a 10-year
        period, restoration costs incurred in connection with Hurricane Isabel in
        September 2003. As a result of the PUC's 2004 decision and in accordance
        with
        SFAS 71, PPL Electric had established a regulatory asset for the restoration
        costs. Effective January 1, 2005, PPL Electric began billing these costs to
        customers and amortizing the regulatory asset. The Commonwealth Court denied
        recovery of these costs because they were incurred when PPL Electric was
        subject
        to capped rates for transmission and distribution services, through December
        31,
        2004. As a result of the Court's decision, PPL Electric recorded a charge
        of $11
        million, or $7 million after tax ($0.02 per share for PPL), in "Other operation
        and maintenance" on the Statements of Income, reversed the remaining unamortized
        regulatory asset of $9 million and recorded a regulatory liability of $2
        million
        for restoration costs previously billed to customers from January 2005 through
        December 2006.

The
        remainder of the regulatory assets included in "Other" will be recovered
        through
        2013.

        system of accounts for PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities are maintained
        in
        accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and
        adopted by the PUC.

Use
        of
        Estimates

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
        preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
        management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
        of
        assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date
        of
        the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
        during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
        estimates.

Loss
        Accruals

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Loss
        accruals are recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
        and other related accounting guidance. Potential losses are accrued when
        (1)
        information is available that indicates it is "probable" that a loss has
        been
        incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the
        amount
        of the loss can be reasonably estimated. FASB defines "probable" as cases
        in
        which "the future event or events are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not
        generally permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains.
        PPL
        continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental
        remediation, litigation claims, income taxes, regulatory penalties and other
        events. PPL discounts its loss accruals for environmental remediation when
        appropriate.

PPL
        also
        has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
        events have occurred. For example, estimated losses were accrued when long-term
        purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and

when
        PPL
        Electric's generation business was deregulated.

Changes
        in Classification

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
        classification of certain amounts in the 2005 and 2004 financial statements
        have
        been changed to conform to the current presentation. The changes in
        classification did not affect net income or total equity. On the Statements
        of
        Income, components of operating income and losses of the Griffith plant were
        reclassified from certain line items to "Loss from Discontinued Operations."
        See
        Note 10 for further discussion.

Comprehensive
        Income

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Comprehensive
        income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as
        changes
        in equity from transactions not related to shareowners. Comprehensive income
        is
        shown on PPL's Statements of Shareowners' Common Equity and Comprehensive
        Income
        and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Member's Equity and Comprehensive
        Income.

Accumulated
        other comprehensive loss, which is presented on the Balance Sheets of PPL
        and
        included in Member's Equity on the PPL Energy Supply Balance Sheets, consisted
        of these after-tax amounts at December 31.

        Risk Management

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply enter into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge
        the
        variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units
        and
        marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. PPL and PPL Energy
        Supply
        enter into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge their exposure to
        changes
        in the fair value of their debt instruments and to hedge their exposure to
        variability in expected cash flows associated with existing debt instruments
        or
        forecasted issuances of debt. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign
        currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related
        to
        firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions,
        net
        investments and foreign earnings translation.

Contracts
        that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS 133,
        "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
        and
        interpreted. Certain energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements
        of SFAS 133 because they meet the definition of a "normal purchase or normal
        sale." These contracts are reflected in the financial statements using the
        accrual method of accounting.

All
        derivative contracts that are subject to the requirements of SFAS 133 and
        its
        amendments are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value. These
        contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
        management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets. Short-term derivative contracts
        are included in "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities." PPL records
        long-term derivative contracts in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets"
        and
        "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities" and PPL Energy Supply
        records long-term derivative contracts in "Other Noncurrent Assets" and
        "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities." On the date the derivative
        contract is executed, PPL may designate the derivative as a hedge of the
        fair
        value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
        ("fair value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability
        of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
        ("cash flow" hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign
        currency" hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net
        investment" hedge). Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded
        in
        either other comprehensive income or in current-period earnings in accordance
        with SFAS 133.

When
        recognized on the Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from energy
        contracts accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges, are reflected
        in
        "Wholesale energy marketing," "Fuel," or "Energy purchases," consistent with
        the
        hedged item. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices of
        energy
        contracts accounted for as fair value hedges are reflected in "Energy purchases"
        on the Statements of Income, as are changes in the underlying position.
        Additionally, PPL enters into certain energy or energy-related contracts
        to
        hedge future cash flows or fair values, but these contracts are not eligible for
        hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133, or hedge accounting treatment
        is not
        elected. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on these transactions are
        reflected in "Wholesale energy marketing" or "Energy purchases," consistent
        with
        the hedged item. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on options to hedge
        synthetic fuel tax credits are reflected in "Energy-related businesses"
        revenues.

Gains
        and
        losses from interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts that
        hedge
        interest payments, when recognized on the Statements of Income, are accounted
        for in "Interest Expense." Gains and losses from foreign currency derivative
        contracts that economically hedge foreign earnings translation are recognized
        in
        "Other Income - net." Gains and losses from foreign currency derivative
        contracts that hedge foreign currency payments for equipment, when recognized
        on
        the Statements of Income, are accounted for in "Depreciation."

PPL
        Energy Supply accounts for non-trading bilateral sales and purchases in
        accordance with EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
        Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for
        Trading
        Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3," to net non-trading bilateral sales
        of
        electricity at major market delivery points with purchases that offset the
        sales
        at those same delivery points. A major market delivery point is any delivery
        point with liquid pricing available.

See
        Note
        18 for additional information on SFAS 133, its amendments and related accounting

Revenue

Utility
        Revenue

(PPL)

The
        Statements of Income "Utility" line item contains revenues from domestic
        and
        international rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
        Energy Supply)

The
        Statements of Income "Utility" line item contains revenues from the
        international rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
        Electric)

Since
        most of PPL Electric's operations are regulated, it is not meaningful to
        use a
        "Utility" caption. Therefore, the revenues of PPL Electric are presented
        according to specific types of revenue.

Revenue
        Recognition

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Operating
        revenues, except for "Energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy
        deliveries through the end of the calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues
        result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout
        the
        month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues
        for
        a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the
        estimated average cents per kWh. Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded
        at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are
        confirmed and invoiced. At that time, unbilled revenue is reversed and actual
        revenue is recorded.

PPL
        records energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered.
        The wholesale sales and purchases that meet the criteria in EITF 03-11 are
        reported net on the Statements of Income within "Wholesale energy marketing."
        Additionally, the bilateral sales and purchases that are designated as trading
        activities are also reported net, in accordance with EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved
        in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
        Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," and are reported
        on
        the Statements of Income within "Net energy trading margins." Spot market
        activity that balances PPL's physical trading positions is included on the
        Statements of Income in "Net energy trading margins."

Certain
        PPL subsidiaries participate in RTOs, primarily in PJM, but also in the
        surrounding regions of New York (NYISO), New England (ISO-NE) and the Midwest
        (MISO). In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity to its
        customers who have selected it as a supplier and a seller for PPL's generation
        subsidiaries. PPL Electric is a transmission owner and PLR in PJM. In ISO-NE,
        PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity, and a seller for PPL's
        New
        England generating assets. In the NYISO and MISO regions, PPL EnergyPlus
        acts as
        a marketer. PPL Electric does not participate in ISO-NE, NYISO or MISO. A
        function of interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements
        (generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their MWh obligations
        (load plus scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day. If
        the net
        result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited
        with
        a spot-market sale to the ISO at the respective market price for that hour;
        if
        the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market
        purchase from the ISO at the respective market price for that hour. ISO
        purchases and sales are not allocated to individual customers. PPL records
        the
        hourly net sales and purchases in its financial statements as sales to and
        purchases from the respective ISOs.

"Energy-related
        businesses" revenue includes revenues from the mechanical contracting and
        engineering subsidiaries, WPD's telecommunications and property subsidiaries
        and
        PPL Global's proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity or
        cost
        method of accounting, as described in the "Business and Consolidation" section
        of Note 1. The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record
        profits from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method
        of
        accounting. Income from time and material contracts is recognized currently
        as
        the work is performed.

Allowance
        for Doubtful Accounts

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Trade
        receivables are reported in the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount
        adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Accounts
        receivable collectibility is evaluated using a combination of factors, including
        past due status based on contractual terms. Reserve balances are analyzed
        to
        assess the reasonableness of the balances in comparison to the actual accounts
        receivable balances and write-offs. Adjustments are made to reserve balances
        based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables, and historical
        and
        industry trends.

Additional
        specific reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, such as bankruptcies,
        are recorded on a case-by-case basis after having been researched and reviewed
        by management. Unusual items, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable,
        counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions are considered as a
        basis
        for determining the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible account
        balances.

Trade
        receivables are charged-off in the period in which the receivable is deemed
        uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously charged-off are
        recorded when it is known they will be received.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

At
        December 31, 2005, PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's significant specific reserves
        related to receivables from Enron Corporation (Enron), which filed for
        bankruptcy in 2001, and from the California ISO, which has withheld payment
        pending the outcome of regulatory proceedings arising from the California
        electricity supply situation that began in 2000. At December 31, 2005, the
        Enron
        and California ISO reserves accounted for 60% of PPL's total allowance for
        doubtful accounts and 80% of PPL Energy Supply's total allowance for doubtful
        accounts.

The
        reserves related to Enron were for claims against Enron North America and
        Enron
        Power Marketing (Enron Subsidiaries), and against Enron, which had guaranteed
        the Enron Subsidiaries' performance (Enron Corporation Guarantees).

In
        March
        2006, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved agreements between Enron and PPL
        Energy
        Supply that settled the litigation between PPL Energy Supply and Enron regarding
        the validity and enforceability of the Enron Corporation Guarantees. As a
        result
        of the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the settlement of the Enron Corporation
        Guarantees litigation and an assessment of current market price quotes for
        the
        purchase of Enron claims, PPL Energy Supply reduced the associated allowance
        for
        doubtful accounts by $15 million or $9 million after tax ($0.03 per share
        for
        PPL).

In
        July
        2006, PPL Energy Supply executed an agreement to assign its Enron claims
        to an
        independent third party for $17 million and further reduced the associated
        allowance for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of 2006 by $4 million,
        or
        $2 million after tax ($0.01 per share for PPL). PPL Energy Supply received
        the
        payment in July 2006. See "Guarantees and Other Assurances" in Note 15 for
        information regarding the indemnifications PPL Energy Supply provided as
        a
        result of the assignment.

At
        December 31, 2006, the California ISO reserves accounted for 34% of PPL's
        total
        allowance for doubtful accounts and 59% of PPL Energy Supply's total allowance
        for doubtful accounts.

Cash
        and Investments

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Cash
        Equivalents

All
        highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
        months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Short-term
        Investments

Highly
        liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months are
        considered to be short-term investments. Short-term investments consist of
        auction rate and similar securities that provide for periodic reset of interest
        rates, and certificates of deposit. Even though PPL considers these investments
        as part of its liquid portfolio, it does not include these investments in
        cash
        and cash equivalents due to their stated maturities. These investments are
        included in "Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheets of PPL and PPL
        Energy
        Supply and in "Current Assets - Other" for PPL Electric.

Restricted
        Cash

Bank
        deposits that are restricted by agreement or that have been designated for
        a
        specific purpose are classified as restricted cash. The change in restricted
        cash is reported as an investing activity in the Statements of Cash Flows.
        On
        the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash is shown as
        "Restricted cash" within current assets, while the noncurrent portion is
        included in "Other" within other noncurrent assets. See Note 19 for the
        components of restricted cash.

Investments
        in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities

Investments
        in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, and measured at amortized
        cost, when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
        Debt securities and marketable equity securities that are acquired and held
        principally for the purpose of selling them in the near-term are classified
        as
        trading. All other investments in debt and marketable equity securities are
        classified as available-for-sale. Both trading and available-for-sale securities
        are carried at fair value. Any unrealized gains and losses for trading
        securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses for
        available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive
        income or are recognized currently in earnings when a decline in fair value
        is
        determined to be other than temporary. The specific identification method
        is
        used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and marketable equity
        securities. See Note 21 for additional information on available-for-sale
        securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust.

Long-Lived
        and Intangible Assets

Property,
        Plant and Equipment

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PP&E
        is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. If impaired, the asset is
        written
        down to fair value at that time, which becomes the asset's new cost basis.
        Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads
        and financing costs, where applicable. The cost of repairs and minor
        replacements are charged to expense as incurred. PPL records costs associated
        with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs
        are
        incurred. No costs are accrued in advance of the period in which the work
        is
        performed.

AFUDC
        is
        capitalized as part of the construction costs for regulated projects. Interest
        is capitalized as part of construction costs for non-regulated
        projects.

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Included
        in PP&E on the balance sheet are capitalized costs of software projects that
        were developed or obtained for internal use. These capitalized costs are
        a

mortized
        ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational,
        generally not to exceed 5 years.

Depreciation

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Depreciation
        is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods
        including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component
        of
        PP&E is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method,
        the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a
        significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the
        composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related
        accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included
        in
        income, unless otherwise required by regulators.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries periodically review the useful lives of their fixed assets.
        In
        light of significant planned environmental capital expenditures, PPL Generation
        conducted studies of the useful lives of Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner
        Island Unit 3 during the first quarter of 2005. Based on these studies, the
        useful lives of these units were extended from 2025 to 2035, effective January
        1, 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, PPL Generation conducted additional
        studies of the useful lives of certain Eastern fossil-fuel and hydroelectric
        generation plants. The most significant change related to the useful lives
        of
        Brunner Island Units 1 and 2 and Martins Creek Units 3 and 4, which were
        extended from 2025 to 2035, effective July 1, 2005. The effect of these changes
        in useful lives for 2005 was to increase net income, as a result of lower
        depreciation, by $7 million (or $0.02 per share for PPL).

In
        2005,
        as a result of the final regulatory outcome published by Ofgem of the most
        recent price control review and an assessment of the economic life of meters,
        WPD reduced the remaining depreciable lives of its existing meter stock to
        approximately nine years. The lives of new meters were reduced from 40 years
        to
        19 years. The effect for 2005 was to decrease net income, as a result of
        higher
        depreciation, by $5 million (or $0.01 per share for PPL).

Following
        are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at December 31.

Goodwill
        and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Goodwill
        represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair
        value
        of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business.
        In accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," PPL
        and its
        subsidiaries do not amortize goodwill.

Other
        acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives are valued at cost
        and
        amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic
        benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used
        up.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries account for emission allowances as intangible assets. As
        such,
        emission allowances are amortized and expensed when consumed. In addition,
        vintage year swaps are accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS
        153,
        "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets -

an
        amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

."

Asset
        Impairment

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries review long-lived assets, including intangibles, that are
        subject to depreciation or amortization for impairment when events or
        circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment
        loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
        recoverable from undiscounted future cash flows. The impairment charge is
        measured by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its
        fair
        value. See Note 9 for a discussion of asset impairment charges recorded.

Intangible
        assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more
        frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be
        impaired. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount of the
        assets exceeds its fair value. The difference represents the amount of
        impairment.

Goodwill
        is reviewed for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually or more
        frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
        may be
        greater than the implied fair value. PPL's reporting units are one level
        below
        its operating segments. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
        its
        fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated. If the
        implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference
        represents the amount of impairment.

PPL
        also
        reviews the residual value of leased assets. Residual value is the estimated
        fair value of the leased property at the end of the lease term. If the residual
        value is determined to be less than the residual value that was originally
        recorded for the property, PPL must determine whether the decrease is other
        than
        temporary. If so, the residual value would be revised using the new estimate
        and
        a loss would be recorded currently. If the residual value is found to be
        greater
        than the original, no adjustment is needed.

Asset
        Retirement Obligations

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries account for the retirement of its long-lived assets according
        to SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses
        the
        accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
        assets and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,
        an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," which clarifies certain aspects
        of
        SFAS 143. SFAS 143 requires legal obligations associated with the retirement
        of
        long-lived assets to be recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.
        The initial obligation is measured at the estimated fair value. An equivalent
        amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and
        allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. Until the obligation
        is
        settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion
        expense in the income statement, for changes in the obligation due to the
        passage of time.

See
        Note
        21 for a discussion of accounting for AROs.

Compensation
        and Benefits

Pension
        and Other Postretirement Benefits

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
        and
        postemployment benefit plans. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers'
        Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
        Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these
        benefits. In addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement date
        provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
        and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31, 2006.

PPL
        uses
        a market-related value of plan assets in accounting for its pension plans.
        The
        market-related value of plan assets is calculated by rolling forward the
        prior
        year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and expected
        return
        on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and
        the
        expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value
        to
        determine the new market-related value.

PPL
        uses
        an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses
        for
        its pension plans. Under the accelerated method, gains and losses in excess
        of
        10% but less than 30% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation
        or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line
        basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants.
        Gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation
        are
        amortized on a straight-line basis over a period equal to one-half of the
        average future service period of the plan participants.

See
        Note
        13 for the impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 and a discussion of pension
        and
        other postretirement benefits.

Stock-Based
        Compensation

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees
        and restricted stock units and stock units to directors under several
        stock-based compensation plans. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
        (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," which is known as SFAS 123(R) and
        replaces SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended
        by SFAS
        148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure."
        PPL
        and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. See Note
        for a discussion of SFAS 123(R). Effective January 1, 2003, PPL and its
        subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
        compensation, as prescribed by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation," using the prospective method of transition permitted by SFAS
        148,
        "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an
        Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." The prospective method of transition
        requires PPL and its subsidiaries to use the fair value method under SFAS
        123 to
        account for all stock-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled
        on
        or after January 1, 2003. Thus, all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003,
        were accounted for under the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25,
        "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," to the extent such awards are
        not
        modified or settled.

Use
        of
        the fair value method prescribed by both SFAS 123 and SFAS 123(R) require
        PPL
        and its subsidiaries to recognize compensation expense for stock options
        issued.
        Fair value for the stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes options
        pricing model. Stock options with graded vesting (i.e., that vest in
        installments) are valued as a single award.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries were not required to recognize compensation expense for
        stock
        options issued and accounted for under the intrinsic value method of APB
        Opinion
        No. 25, since PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not
        less
        than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant. As
        currently structured, awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units
        and
        directors' stock units result in the same amount of compensation expense
        under
        the fair value method of SFAS 123 or SFAS 123(R) as they would under the
        intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25 since the value of the awards
        are
        based on the fair value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant. See Note
        for a discussion of stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation is
        included in "Other operation and maintenance" expense on the Statements of
        Income.

The
        table
        below illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and EPS as if the fair
        value method had been used to account for all outstanding stock-based
        compensation awards in 2004. For 2005, the difference between the pro forma
        and
        reported amounts would have been insignificant. In 2006, PPL accounted for
        all
        stock-based compensation awards under the fair value method.

        PPL
        Services' expense.

(PPL

PPL
        Electric's stock-based compensation expense, including awards granted to
        employees and an allocation of costs of awards granted to employees of PPL
        Services, was insignificant under both the intrinsic value and fair value
        methods for each of 2006, 2005 and 2004.

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

SFAS
        123(R) provided additional guidance on the requirement to accelerate expense
        recognition for employees who are at or near retirement age and who are under
        a
        plan that allows for accelerated vesting upon an employee's retirement. Such
        guidance is relevant to prior accounting for stock-based compensation under
        other accounting guidance. PPL's stock-based compensation plans allow for
        accelerated vesting upon an employee's retirement. Thus, for employees who
        are
        retirement eligible when stock-based awards are granted, PPL recognizes the
        expense immediately. For employees who are not retirement eligible when
        stock-based awards are granted, PPL amortizes the awards on a straight-line
        basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period up to the employee's
        attainment of retirement age. Retirement eligible has been defined by PPL
        as the
        early retirement age of 55. The adjustments below related to retirement-eligible
        employees were recorded based on the aforementioned clarification of existing
        guidance and are not related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

(PPL)

In
        2005,
        PPL recorded a charge of $10 million after tax, or $0.03 per share, to
        accelerate stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees,
        of which $5 million of the after-tax total, or $0.01 per share, was related
        to
        periods prior to 2005. The prior period amounts were not material to previously
        issued financial statements.

(PPL
        Energy Supply)

In
        2005,
        PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $7 million after tax to accelerate
        stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, of which
        $3
        million of the after-tax total was related to periods prior to 2005. The
        prior
        period amounts were not material to previously issued financial
        statements.

(PPL
        Electric)

In
        2005,
        PPL Electric recorded a charge of $3 million after tax to accelerate stock-based
        compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, of which $2 million
        of
        the after-tax total was related to periods prior to 2005. The prior period
        amounts were not material to previously issued financial
        statements.

Other

Income
        Taxes

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
        income tax provision for PPL and its subsidiaries is calculated in accordance
        with SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." PPL and its domestic subsidiaries
        file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

Significant
        management judgment is required in developing PPL and its subsidiaries'
        provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets
        and liabilities, valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets
        and
        estimating the phase-out range for synthetic fuel tax credits that is not
        published by the IRS until April of the following year. PPL and its subsidiaries
        record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
        that
        are more likely than not to be realized. PPL and its subsidiaries consider
        future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies
        in assessing the need for valuation allowances. If PPL and its subsidiaries
        determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future
        in
        excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation
        allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such
        determination is made. Likewise, if PPL and its subsidiaries determine that
        they
        are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future,
        adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing
        tax
        expense in the period that such determination is made.

Annual
        tax provisions include amounts to pay assessments that may result from
        examination by taxing authorities of prior year tax returns. The amounts
        ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by such authorities may
        differ
        materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact PPL and its
        subsidiaries' financial statements in the future. In evaluating the exposure
        associated with various tax filing positions, PPL and its subsidiaries accrue
        charges for probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the
        amount
        of benefit that should be recognized in the financial statements in accordance
        with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies."

The
        provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in accordance
        with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that taxable income
        be
        calculated as if PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric and any domestic
        subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return. PPL Energy Supply's
        intercompany tax liability was $17 million and $40 million at December 31,
        and 2005. PPL Electric's intercompany tax receivable was $2 million at December
        31, 2006, and its intercompany tax liability was $6 million at December 31,
        2005.

PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric deferred investment tax credits when the credits
        were utilized and are amortizing the deferred amounts over the average lives
        of
        the related assets.

See
        Note
        5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

The
        provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is
        based
        upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC
        and the
        FERC. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated
        assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP is
        deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "Regulatory
        and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance Sheet.

Taxes,
        Other Than Income

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries present sales taxes in "Accounts Payable" and value added
        taxes
        in "Taxes" on their Balance Sheets. These taxes are not reflected on the
        Statements of Income. See Note 5 for details on taxes included in "Taxes,
        other
        than income" on the Statements of Income.

Leases

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries apply the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases,"
        as
        amended and interpreted, to all transactions that qualify for lease accounting.
        See Note 11 for a discussion of accounting for leases under which PPL, PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric are lessees.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        EnergyPlus is the lessor, for accounting purposes, of a 79.9 MW oil-powered
        station in Shoreham, New York. The Long Island Power Authority has contracted
        to
        purchase all of the plant's capacity and ancillary services as part of a
        15-year
        power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus, which ends in 2017. The capacity
        payments in the power purchase agreement result in the plant being classified
        as
        a direct-financing lease. Additionally, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply
        is the
        lessor, for accounting purposes, of a sales-type lease related to an 8 MW
        on-site electrical generation plant.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, PPL and PPL Energy Supply had receivable balances
        of
        $240 million and $256 million (included in "Current Assets - Other" and
        "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL and "Current Assets
        -
        Other" and "Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL Energy Supply) and unearned
        revenue balances of $128 million and $143 million (included in "Current
        Liabilities - Other" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities
        -
        Other"). The receivable balances include $65 million of an unguaranteed residual
        value. Rental income received during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $14 million,
        $15
        million and $14 million. Total future minimum lease payments expected to
        be
        received on both leases are estimated at $16 million for each of the years
        from
        2007 through 2011.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries value inventory at the lower of cost or market. Inventory
        is
        removed and charged to the Statements of Income using the average-cost method,
        except for natural gas, which is removed and charged to the Statements of
        Income
        using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). The carrying value of the LIFO
        inventory was $13 million and $16 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
        and the
        excess of replacement cost over carrying value was $16 million and $15 million
        at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Treasury
        Stock

(

PPL
        and PPL Electric)

Treasury
        shares are reflected on the balance sheet as an offset to shareowners' equity
        under the cost method of accounting. Treasury shares are not considered
        outstanding in calculating EPS.

(PPL)

At
        December 31, 2005, PPL held 62,113,489 shares of treasury stock. PPL held
        no
        treasury stock at December 31, 2006. In the second quarter of 2006, PPL
        retired all treasury shares, which totaled 62,174,729 shares, and restored
        them
        to authorized but unissued shares of common stock. "Capital in excess of
        par
        value" was reduced by $839 million as a result of the retirement. Total
        "Shareowners' Common Equity" was not impacted. PPL plans to restore all shares
        of common stock acquired in the future to authorized but unissued shares
        of
        common stock upon acquisition.

(PPL
        Electric)

At
        December 31, 2005, PPL Electric held 79,270,519 shares of treasury stock.
        PPL
        Electric held no treasury stock at December 31, 2006. In the second quarter
        of 2006, PPL Electric retired all treasury shares, which totaled 90,932,326
        shares, and restored them to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
        "Common stock" was reduced by $1.1 billion as a result of the retirement.
        Total
        "Shareowners' Equity" was not impacted. PPL Electric plans to restore all
        shares
        of common stock acquired in the future to authorized but unissued shares
        of
        common stock upon acquisition.

Foreign
        Currency Translation and Transactions

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Assets
        and liabilities of international operations, where the local currency is
        the
        functional currency, are translated at the exchange rates on the date of
        consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average
        exchange rates prevailing during the year. Adjustments resulting from
        translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The local
        currency is the functional currency for all of PPL's international operating
        companies except for those located in Bolivia, where the U.S. dollar is the
        functional currency.

Gains
        or
        losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized currently
        in
        income. The net transaction losses were insignificant in 2006, 2005 and
        2004.

Segment
        and Related Information

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL's
        reportable segments are Supply, International Delivery and Pennsylvania
        Delivery. The Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy
        marketing, domestic generation and domestic development operations of PPL
        Energy
        Supply. The International Delivery segment includes operations of the
        international energy businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused
        on the
        distribution of electricity. The majority of PPL Global's international
        businesses are located in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia. The
        Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric and gas delivery
        operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.

PPL
        Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International Delivery.
        The
        International Delivery segment at the PPL Energy Supply level is consistent
        with
        the International Delivery segment at the PPL level. The Supply segment
        information reported at the PPL Energy Supply level will not agree with the
        Supply segment information reported at the PPL level because additional Supply
        segment functions exist at PPL that are outside of PPL Energy Supply.
        Furthermore, certain income items, including PLR revenue and certain interest
        income, exist at the PPL Energy Supply level, but are eliminated in
        consolidation at the PPL level. Finally, certain expense items are fully
        allocated to the segments at the PPL level only.

Segments
        include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate costs,
        for services provided by PPL Services. These service costs include functions
        such as financial, legal, human resources and information services.

Financial
        data for the segments are:

The
        net
        income of the International Delivery segment for the year ended December
        31,
        2006, reflects accounting adjustments related to prior periods. During the
        third
        quarter of 2006, management determined that it had incorrectly applied the
        impacts of Chilean inflation in calculating depreciation and deferred income
        taxes on certain Chilean assets from 1997 through 2006. As a result, net
        income
        was increased by $5 million for the depreciation adjustment in the third
        quarter
        of 2006, of which $4 million related to periods prior to 2006 and less than
        $1
        million related to the first and second quarters of 2006. Net income was
        also
        increased by $9 million for the deferred income tax adjustment in the third
        quarter of 2006, of which $8 million related to periods prior to 2006 and
        less
        than $1 million related to the first and second quarters of 2006. These
        adjustments are not considered by management to be material to the financial
        statements of prior periods and are not material to the financial statements
        for
        2006.

Investment
        in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method at December

In
        2006,
        a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary sold its 50% interest in a partnership that
        owned
        the Griffith plant. See Note 10 for additional information. The partnership
        arrangement was essentially a cost-sharing arrangement, in that each of the
        partners had rights to one-half of the plant capacity and energy, and an
        obligation to cover one-half of the operating costs of the plant. Accordingly,
        the equity investment is not reflected in the table above and is classified
        as
        "Electric plant in service - Generation" on the Balance Sheet at December
        31,
        2005.

Earnings

Per Share

(PPL)

In
        August
        2005, PPL completed a 2-for-1 split of its common stock. The distribution
        date
        was August 24, 2005. The share and per-share amounts included in these financial
        statements have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the stock
        split.

Basic
        EPS
        is calculated using the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding
        during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated using the weighted-average shares
        of common stock outstanding that are increased for additional shares that
        would
        be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common
        stock. Potentially dilutive securities consist of:

The
        basic
        and diluted EPS calculations, and the reconciliation of the shares (in
        thousands) used in the calculations, are:

In
        May
        2001, PPL and PPL Capital Funding Trust I issued 23 million PEPS Units that
        contained a purchase contract component for PPL's common stock. In January
        2004,
        PPL completed an exchange offer resulting in the exchange of approximately
        four
        million PEPS Units for PEPS Units, Series B. The primary difference in the
        units
        related to the debt component. The purchase contract components of both units
        were identical. The purchase contracts were only dilutive if the average
        price
        of PPL's common stock exceeded a threshold appreciation price, which was
        adjusted for cash distributions on PPL common stock. The threshold appreciation
        price for the PEPS Units was initially set at $32.52 and was adjusted to
        $31.69
        as of April 1, 2004, based on dividends paid on PPL's common stock since
        issuance. The threshold appreciation price for the purchase contract component
        of the PEPS Units, Series B was adjusted in the same manner as that of the
        PEPS
        Units and was $31.69 as a result of the adjustment as of April 1, 2004. The
        purchase contracts of both the PEPS Units and PEPS Units, Series B were settled
        in May 2004. Since the average price did not exceed the threshold appreciation
        price, the purchase contracts were excluded from the diluted EPS calculations
        for 2004.

In
        May
        2003, PPL Energy Supply issued $400 million of 2.625% Convertible Senior
        Notes
        due 2023. The notes are guaranteed by PPL and, as originally issued, could
        be
        converted into shares of PPL common stock if:

The
        conversion rate is 40.2212 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or
        $24.8625 per share). It will be adjusted if certain specified distributions,
        whether in the form of cash, stock, other equity interests, evidence of
        indebtedness or assets, are made to holders of PPL common stock. Additionally,
        the conversion rate can be increased by PPL if its Board of Directors has
        made a
        determination that to do so would be in the best interests of either PPL
        or
        holders of PPL common stock.

Depending
        upon which of the conversion events identified above occurs, the Convertible
        Senior Notes, as originally issued, could have been settled in cash or shares.
        However, the notes were modified in November 2004 to require cash settlement
        of
        the principal amount, permit settlement of any conversion premium in cash
        or
        stock, and eliminate a provision that required settlement in stock in the
        event
        of default. These modifications were made in response to the FASB's ratification
        of EITF Issue 04-8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
        Diluted Earnings per Share," as well as other anticipated rules relating
        to EPS.
        EITF Issue 04-8 requires contingently convertible instruments to be included
        in
        diluted EPS.

The
        Convertible Senior Notes have a dilutive impact when the average market price
        of
        PPL common stock equals or exceeds $24.87.

See
        Note
        8 for discussion of attainment of the market price trigger related to the
        Convertible Senior Notes and the related conversions during 2006.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, only $102 million of Convertible Senior Notes remains
        outstanding. The maximum number of shares of PPL common stock that could
        potentially be issued to settle the conversion premium, based upon the current
        conversion rate, is 4,117,042 shares. Based on PPL's common stock price at
        December 31, 2006, the conversion premium equated to 1,261,015 shares of
        PPL
        common stock, or $45 million.

During
        2006, PPL issued 1,546,447 shares of common stock related to the exercise
        of
        stock options and vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units
        under
        its stock-based compensation plans. See Note 12 for a discussion of PPL's
        stock-based compensation plans.

The
        following number of stock options to purchase PPL common shares were excluded
        in
        the periods' computations of diluted EPS because the effect would have been
        antidilutive.

Income
        and Other Taxes

For

(PPL)

"Income

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
        the
        carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
        basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and
        tax
        credit carryforwards.

Net
        deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates
        of
        future taxable income for U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which
        PPL's

PPL
        had

        carryforward period of $27 million and $111 million at December 31, 2006
        and
        2005. PPL had federal foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2015
        of
        $20 million and $1 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. PPL also had state
        net
        operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2006 and 2027 of $216 million
        and $97 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Valuation allowances have
        been
        established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be
        realized.

PPL
        Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $37 million and $50
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. PPL Global also had foreign capital
        loss
        carryforwards of $563 million and $439 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005. All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward period. Valuation
        allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not,
        will
        not be realized. Of the total valuation allowances related to foreign capital
        loss carryforwards, $83 million is allocable to goodwill.

PPL
        Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings
        of
        its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings
        are
        permanently reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings are included
        in
        "Earnings reinvested" on the Balance Sheets. The amounts considered permanently
        reinvested at December 31, 2006 and 2005, are $910 million and $650 million.
        If
        the earnings are remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional
        U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to
        estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign
        earnings.

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
        the
        carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
        basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and
        tax
        credit carryforwards.

Net
        deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates
        of
        future taxable income for U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which
        PPL's
        operations have historically been profitable.

Significant
        components of PPL Energy Supply's deferred income tax assets and liabilities
        from continuing operations were as follows:

PPL
        Energy Supply had federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with
        an
        indefinite carryforward period of $27 million and $111 million at December
        31,
        2006 and 2005. PPL Energy Supply had federal foreign tax credit carryforwards
        that expire in 2015 of $20 million and $1 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005.
        PPL Energy Supply also had state net operating loss carryforwards that expire
        between 2006 and 2027 of $9 million and $6 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005. Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more
        likely than not, will not be realized.

PPL
        Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $37 million and $50
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. PPL Global also had foreign capital
        loss
        carryforwards of $563 million and $439 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005. All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward period. Valuation
        allowances have been established for the amount that more likely than not,
        will
        not be realized. Of the total valuation allowances related to foreign capital
        loss carryforwards, $83 million is allocable to goodwill.

PPL
        Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings
        of
        its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings
        are
        permanently reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings are included
        in
        "Member's Equity" on the Balance Sheets. The amounts considered permanently
        reinvested at December 31, 2006 and 2005, are $910 million and $650 million.
        If
        the earnings are remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional
        U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to
        estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign
        earnings.

(PPL
        Electric)

The
        provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is
        based
        upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC
        and the
        FERC. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated
        assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP is
        deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "Regulatory
        and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance Sheets.

The
        tax
        effects of significant temporary differences comprising PPL Electric's net
        deferred income tax liability were as follows:

Instruments

(PPL,

At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
        short-term investments, investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust
        funds,
        other investments and short-term debt approximated fair value due to the
        liquid
        nature of the instruments, variable interest rates associated with the financial
        instruments or the carrying value of the instruments being based on established
        market prices. Price risk management assets and liabilities are recorded
        at fair
        value using exchange-traded market quotes, prices obtained through third-party
        brokers or internally developed price curves. Financial instruments where
        the

                  outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

(c)

2.5
                  million shares of preference stock were issued in
                  2006.

Preferred
        Stock

The
        involuntary liquidation price of the preferred stock is $100 per share. The
        optional voluntary liquidation price is the optional redemption price per
        share
        in effect, except for the 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and the 6.75% Series Preferred
        Stock for which such price is $100 per share (plus, in each case, any unpaid
        dividends in arrears).

Holders
        of the outstanding preferred stock are entitled to one vote per share on
        matters
        on which PPL Electric's shareowners are entitled to vote. Preferred Stock
        ranks
        senior to PPL Electric's common stock and 6.25% Series Preference
        Stock.

Preference
        Stock

In
        April
        2006, PPL Electric sold 10 million depositary shares, each representing a
        quarter interest in a share of PPL Electric's 6.25% Series Preference Stock
        (Preference Shares), totaling $250 million. In connection with the sale of
        the
        depositary shares, PPL Electric issued 2.5 million Preference Shares, with
        a
        liquidation preference of $100 per share, to the bank acting as a depositary.
        PPL Electric used the net proceeds of $245 million from the offering to
        repurchase $200 million of its common stock held by PPL, and for other general
        corporate purposes. PPL used the $200 million received from PPL Electric
        to fund
        capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

Holders
        of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences
        of the Preference Shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation
        rights, exercised through the depositary. The Preference Shares rank senior
        to
        PPL Electric's common stock and junior to its preferred stock, and they have
        no
        voting rights, except as provided by law.

Dividends
        on the Preference Shares will be paid when, as and if declared by the Board
        of
        Directors at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, or $1.5625 per depositary share
        per
        year, and are not cumulative. PPL Electric may not pay dividends on, or redeem,
        purchase or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its common
        stock,
        except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends on the Preference
        Shares
        have been paid for the then-current dividend period.

The
        Preference Shares do not have a stated maturity, and are not subject to sinking
        fund requirements. However, PPL Electric may, at its option, redeem the
        Preference Shares in whole or in part from time to time for $100 per share
        (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid
        dividends, on or after April 6, 2011.

In
        May
        2006, PPL Electric filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that,
        among other things, increased the authorized amount of preference stock from
        million to 10 million shares, without nominal or par value.

and Financing Activities

Credit
        Arrangements

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        Energy Supply maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and
        provide credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper program.

In
        March
        2006, PPL Energy Supply extended the expiration date of its 364-day
        reimbursement agreement to March 2007. Under the agreement, PPL Energy Supply
        can cause the bank to issue up to $200 million of letters of credit but cannot
        make cash borrowings under this agreement. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
        there was $47 million and $199 million of letters of credit outstanding under
        this agreement.

In
        June
        2006, PPL Energy Supply entered into a $1.9 billion Amended and Restated
        Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in June 2011. This credit agreement
        amended, restated and combined into one credit facility the following three
        five-year credit facilities of PPL Energy Supply: the $800 million facility
        expiring in June 2010, the $600 million facility expiring in June 2010 and
        the
        $500 million facility expiring in December 2010. PPL Energy Supply has the
        ability to cause the lenders under this facility to issue letters of credit.
        At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply had an aggregate of $51 million of letters
        of credit and no cash borrowings outstanding under this facility. There was
        an
        aggregate of $172 million of letters of credit and no cash borrowings
        outstanding under the facilities that were in existence as of December 31,
        2005.

PPL
        Energy Supply also maintains a $300 million five-year letter of credit and
        revolving credit facility expiring in March 2011. There were no cash borrowings
        and $222 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility, at
        December 31, 2006, and no cash borrowings and $286 million of letters of
        credit outstanding at December 31, 2005. PPL Energy Supply's obligations
        under
        this facility are supported by a $300 million letter of credit issued on
        PPL
        Energy Supply's behalf under a separate $300 million five-year letter of
        credit
        and reimbursement agreement also expiring in March 2011.

PPL
        Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million
        to
        provide it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity
        needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by
        PPL
        Energy Supply's $1.9 billion five-year credit facility. PPL Energy Supply
        had no
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, and $100 million of
        commercial paper, with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.51%, outstanding
        at
        December 31, 2005.

WPD
        (South West) maintained three committed credit facilities: a £100 million
        364-day facility, a £150 million three-year facility and a £150 million
        five-year facility (approximately $787 million in total at December 31, 2006).
        In November 2006, WPD (South West) replaced its £100 million 364-day credit
        facility that expired in October 2006, with a credit facility of the same
        size
        that expires in November 2007. The five-year facility expires in October
        2009.
        In January 2007, the £150 million three-year facility, which was to expire in
        October 2008, was terminated and replaced by a new £150 million five-year
        facility at WPDH Limited that expires in January 2012, with the option to
        extend
        the expiration date by a maximum of two years. At December 31, 2006 and
        2005, WPD (South West) also had uncommitted credit facilities of £65 million
        (approximately $128 million at December 31, 2006). At December 31, 2006 and
        2005, there were no cash borrowings and £41 million (approximately $71 million
        at then current exchange rates), with a weighted-average interest rate of
        4.98%,
        outstanding under the WPD (South West) credit facilities.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide
        credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper program.

In
        June
        2006, PPL Electric amended and restated the credit agreement for its $200
        million five-year credit facility and extended the expiration date to June
        2011.
        PPL Electric has the ability to cause the lenders under this facility to
        issue
        letters of credit. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, PPL Electric had no cash
        borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility. PPL
        Electric's $100 million three-year credit facility expired in June 2006 and
        was
        not renewed.

PPL
        Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
        it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
        if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL
        Electric's $200 million five-year credit facility. PPL Electric had no
        commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

PPL
        Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through
        which
        PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
        receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary
        on
        an ongoing basis. The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans
        from a
        commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. PPL Electric
        uses
        the proceeds from the credit agreement for general corporate purposes and
        to
        cash collateralize letters of credit. The subsidiary's borrowing limit under
        this credit agreement is $150 million, and interest under the credit agreement
        varies based on the commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue commercial
        paper that supports the debt. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $136 million
        and
        $131 million of accounts receivable and $145 million and $142 million of
        unbilled revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement.
        At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, there was $42 million of short-term debt outstanding
        under the credit agreement at an interest rate of 5.35% for 2006 and 4.3%
        for
        2005, all of which was being used to cash collateralize letters of credit
        issued
        on PPL Electric's behalf. At December 31, 2006, based on the accounts receivable
        and unbilled revenue pledged, an additional $108 million was available for
        borrowing. The funds used to cash collateralize the letters of credit are
        reported in "Restricted Cash" on the Balance Sheets. PPL Electric's sale
        to its
        subsidiary of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute
        sale
        of the assets, and PPL Electric does not retain an interest in these assets.
        However, for financial reporting purposes, the subsidiary's financial results
        are consolidated in PPL Electric's financial statements. PPL Electric performs
        certain record-keeping and cash collection functions with respect to the
        assets
        in return for a servicing fee from the subsidiary. In July 2006, PPL Electric
        and the subsidiary extended the expiration date of the credit agreement to
        July
        2007. PPL Electric currently expects that it and the subsidiary will continue
        to
        renew the credit agreement on an annual basis.

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
        2001,
        PPL Electric completed a strategic initiative to confirm its legal separation
        from PPL and PPL's other affiliated companies. This initiative was designed
        to
        enable PPL Electric to substantially reduce its exposure to volatility in
        energy
        prices and supply risks through 2009 and to reduce its business and financial
        risk profile by, among other things, limiting its business activities to
        the
        transmission and distribution of electricity and businesses related to or
        arising out of the electric transmission and distribution businesses.

In
        connection with this initiative, PPL Electric:

The
        enhancements to PPL Electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended
        to minimize the risk that a court would order PPL Electric's assets and
        liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of PPL or another
        affiliate of PPL in the event that PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become
        a
        debtor in a bankruptcy case. Based on these various measures, PPL Electric
        was
        able to issue and maintain a higher level of debt and use it to replace higher
        cost equity, thereby maintaining a lower total cost of capital. Nevertheless,
        if
        PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case,
        there
        can be no assurance that a court would not order PPL Electric's assets and
        liabilities to be consolidated with those of PPL or such other PPL
        affiliate.

The
        subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities. PPL's subsidiaries are not
        liable for the debts of PPL. Accordingly, creditors of PPL may not satisfy
        their
        debts from the assets of the subsidiaries absent a specific contractual
        undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as required by applicable
        law or regulation. Similarly, absent a specific contractual undertaking or
        as
        required by applicable law or regulation, PPL is not liable for the debts
        of its
        subsidiaries. Accordingly, creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy
        their
        debts from the assets of PPL absent a specific contractual undertaking by
        PPL to
        pay the creditors of its subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or
        regulation.

Similarly,
        the subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are separate legal
        entities. These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL Energy Supply
        and PPL Electric. Accordingly, creditors of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
        may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their subsidiaries absent
        a
        specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay the creditors or
        as
        required by applicable law or regulation. In addition, absent a specific
        contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation, PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric are not liable for the debts of their
        subsidiaries. Accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy
        their
        debts from the assets of PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric absent a specific
        contractual undertaking by that parent to pay the creditors of its subsidiaries
        or as required by applicable law or regulation.

Financing
        Activities

(PPL)

In
        May
        2006, PPL Capital Funding retired all $99 million of its Senior Floating
        Rate
        Notes and all $148 million of its 7.29% Subordinated Notes upon
        maturity.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        December 2005, Elfec made a scheduled $3 million principal payment on its
        $23
        million of Bolivian bonds, which was funded primarily with short-term debt.
        This
        transaction was recorded in January 2006 due to the one-month lag in foreign
        subsidiary reporting.

PPL
        Energy Supply issued $300 million of 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 (6.20% Notes)
        in May 2006 and issued an additional $150 million of the 6.20% Notes in July
        2006. The 6.20% Notes may be redeemed any time prior to maturity at PPL Energy
        Supply's option at make-whole redemption prices. In July 2006, PPL Energy
        Supply
        also issued $250 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2046 (7% Notes). The 7% Notes
        are not subject to redemption prior to July 15, 2011. On or after July 15,
        2011, PPL Energy Supply may, at its option, redeem the 7% Notes, in whole
        or in
        part, at par. Proceeds from the sale of both the 6.20% Notes and 7% Notes
        were
        used for capital expenditures, including expenditures relating to PPL Energy
        Supply's installation of pollution control equipment at two of its coal-fired
        power plants in Pennsylvania, and for general corporate purposes.

In
        December 2006, PPL Energy Supply issued $300 million of 6% Senior Notes due
        (6% Notes). The 6% Notes may be redeemed any time prior to maturity at PPL
        Energy Supply's option at make-whole redemption prices. The proceeds of $297
        million, net of discount, from the sale of the 6% Notes were used to replenish
        cash and repay short-term indebtedness that PPL Energy Supply used or incurred
        to fund conversions in 2006 of its 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023,
        as
        discussed below.

The
        terms
        of PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 include a
        market
        price trigger that permits holders to convert the notes during any fiscal
        quarter if the closing sale price of PPL's common stock exceeds $29.83 for
        at
        least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
        trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. This market price trigger was
        met
        in each quarter of 2006. Therefore, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes
        were
        entitled to convert their notes at any time during the second, third and
        fourth
        quarters of 2006 and are also entitled to convert their notes any time during
        the first quarter of 2007. As discussed in Note 4, when holders elect to
        convert
        the Convertible Senior Notes, PPL Energy Supply is required to settle the
        principal amount in cash and any conversion premium in cash or PPL common
        stock.

During
        2006, Convertible Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $298 million
        were presented for conversion. The total conversion premium related to these
        conversions was $121 million, which was settled with 3,448,109 shares of
        PPL
        common stock, along with an insignificant amount of cash in lieu of fractional
        shares. After such conversions, $102 million of Convertible Senior Notes
        remain
        outstanding and are eligible for conversion in the first quarter of 2007.

In
        July
        2006, Emel issued 3 million UF denominated bonds (approximately $104 million
        at
        December 31, 2006) in two series. The first series consists of 1 million
        UF
        denominated bonds that mature in 2011, are callable at par on or after June
        1,
        2009, and bear interest at 3.75%. The second series consists of 2 million
        UF
        denominated bonds with serial maturities from 2021 through 2027, which are
        callable on or after June 1, 2014, at a specified calculated value on the
        call
        date and bear interest at 4.50%. The proceeds were used to pay Emel's
        3 million UF denominated bond maturity in August 2006.

In
        December 2006, WPD (South West) issued £225 million of index-linked notes
        (approximately $443 million at December 31, 2006) in two tranches: £120
        million of 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2056 and £105 million of 1.541%
        Index-linked Notes due 2053. Both series of notes may be redeemed by WPD
        (South
        West), in total by series but not in part, in December 2026. The proceeds
        were
        used to fund the maturity of WPD LLP's $332 million of 6.80% Notes in December
        2006 and payment of $118 million to settle related cross-currency swaps.
        The
        $118 million payment is included on the Statement of Cash Flows as a component
        of "Retirement of long-term debt."

In
        December 2006, WPD (South Wales) issued £225 million of 4.80436% Notes due 2037
        (approximately $443 million at December 31, 2006). The notes may be redeemed
        by
        WPD (South Wales), in total but not in part, in December 2026. The proceeds
        will
        be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing debt obligations
        of companies within the WPDH Limited group.

Although
        financial information of foreign subsidiaries is recorded on a one-month
        lag,
        the December 2006 bond issuances, bond retirement and related settlement
        of
        cross-currency swaps by the WPD entities noted above are reflected in the
        Financial Statements due to the materiality of these transactions.

In
        December 2006, Elfec issued $11 million of 6.05% UFV (inflation-adjusted
        bolivianos) denominated bonds with serial maturities from 2012 through 2014.
        Of
        these bonds, $5 million were issued in exchange for existing bonds with
        maturities in 2007 and 2008. Proceeds of $6 million were used in January
        2007 to
        refinance bonds with maturities in 2007. These transactions will be reflected
        in
        PPL's January 2007 financials due to the one-month lag in foreign subsidiary
        reporting.

In
        February 2007, WPD LLP redeemed all of the 8.23% Subordinated Debentures
        due
        2027 that were held by SIUK Capital Trust I. Upon redemption, WPD LLP paid
        a
        premium of 4.115%, or approximately $3 million, on the principal amount of
        $85
        million of subordinated debentures. In connection with this redemption, SIUK
        Capital Trust I was required to use all of the proceeds received from the
        repayment of the subordinated debentures to redeem all of its common and
        preferred securities. See Note 22 for a discussion of the trust. The redemption
        of the subordinated debentures and the trust's common and preferred securities
        resulted in a loss of $2 million, after tax, that will be recorded by WPD
        LLP in
        2007.

(PPL
        Energy Supply)

During
        2006, PPL Energy Supply distributed $712 million to its parent company, PPL
        Energy Funding, and received cash capital contributions of $115 million.

On
        July
        1, 2006, in connection with an internal reorganization, PPL Energy Supply
        received non-cash contributions from its parent, consisting of a note receivable
        and ownership interests in certain subsidiaries (including PPL Telcom). The
        contributions were recorded at the parent's historical carrying amounts,
        collectively totaling $65 million. The businesses of these subsidiaries became
        a
        component of PPL Energy Supply's Supply segment. The impact on PPL Energy
        Supply's financial statements and to its Supply segment was not significant.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

In
        March
        2006, PPL Electric retired all $146 million of its 6.55% Series First Mortgage
        Bonds upon maturity.

During
        2006, PPL Transition Bond Company made principal payments on transition bonds
        of
        $288 million.

See
        Note
        7 for a discussion of PPL Electric's issuance of preference stock in
        2006.

(PPL
        Electric)

During
        2006, PPL Electric received a capital contribution of $75 million from PPL.

Dividends
        and Dividend Restrictions

(PPL)

In
        February 2006, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend,
        effective April 1, 2006, to 27.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.10 per
        annum). In February 2007, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly common
        stock dividend, payable April 1, 2007, to 30.5 cents per share (equivalent
        to
        $1.22 per annum). Future dividends, declared at the discretion of PPL's Board
        of
        Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial
        requirements and other factors.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

The
        PPL
        Montana Colstrip lease places certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability
        to
        declare dividends. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not
        limit PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's ability to operate as desired and will
        not
        affect their ability to meet any of their cash obligations. Certain of PPL
        Global's international subsidiaries also have financing arrangements that
        limit
        their ability to pay dividends. However, PPL does not, at this time, expect
        that
        any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's
        ability to meet their cash obligations.

(PPL
        Electric)

During
        2006, PPL Electric paid common stock dividends of $116 million to PPL.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments
        in the
        event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to
        comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation
        and
        Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other subsidiaries.
        PPL
        Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would
        significantly impact its ability to declare dividends.

As
        discussed in Note 7, PPL Electric may not pay dividends on its common stock,
        except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends have been paid on
        the
        Preference Shares for the then-current dividend period. The quarterly dividend
        rate for PPL Electric's Preference Shares is $1.5625 per share. PPL Electric
        has
        declared and paid dividends on its outstanding Preference Shares since issuance.
        Dividends on the preference stock are not cumulative and future dividends,
        declared at the discretion of PPL Electric's Board of Directors, will be
        dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other
        factors.

Acquisitions,
        Development and Divestitures

From
        time
        to time, PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third
        parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets,
        joint
        ventures and development projects. Any such transactions may impact future
        financial results.

Domestic

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Sales

In
        2004,
        a subsidiary of PPL Generation sold two spare gas combustion turbine generators
        and related equipment for $18 million. These turbine generators and related
        equipment were originally intended for a project in New York that PPL later
        canceled. The net loss from this sale was insignificant.

Also
        in
        2004, PPL Maine entered into an agreement with a coalition of government
        agencies and private groups to sell three of its nine hydroelectric dams
        in
        Maine. Under the agreement, a non-profit organization designated by the
        coalition would have a five-year option to purchase the dams for $25 million,
        and PPL Maine would receive rights to increase energy output at its other
        hydroelectric dams in Maine. The coalition has announced plans to remove
        or
        bypass the dams subject to the agreement in order to restore runs of Atlantic
        salmon and other migratory fish to the Penobscot River. The agreement requires
        several approvals by the FERC. Certain of these regulatory approvals have
        been
        obtained, but PPL cannot predict whether or when all of them will be
        obtained.

License
        Renewals

In
        September 2006, PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for 20-year license renewals
        for Units 1 and 2 of the nuclear power plant. The license renewals for each
        of
        the Susquehanna units would extend their expiration dates from 2022 to 2042
        for
        Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2. PPL cannot predict whether or when
        NRC
        approval will be obtained.

In
        December 2006, PPL Montana applied to the FERC to renew its license to generate
        electricity at the Mystic Lake Project. The current license expires in 2009.
        Power companies that use dams to produce energy must renew their FERC licenses
        every 30 to 50 years. PPL cannot predict whether or when the FERC approval
        will
        be obtained.

Development

In
        October 2006, PPL Susquehanna filed a request with the NRC to increase the
        amount of electricity the plant can generate. The total expected capacity
        increase is 205 MW, of which PPL Susquehanna's share would be 185 MW. PPL
        Susquehanna's share of the expected capital cost of this project is $263
        million. PPL cannot predict whether or when NRC approval will be obtained.

PPL
        also
        plans to expand the capacity of its Holtwood hydroelectric plant by 125 MW,
        at
        an expected capital cost of $243 million. This planned expansion is subject
        to
        various regulatory approvals and other conditions, and PPL cannot predict
        whether or when these approvals will be obtained or the other conditions
        will be
        met.

Other

(PPL)

In
        June
        2004, a PPL subsidiary evaluated its investment in a technology supplier
        for
        impairment. As a result of the evaluation, the subsidiary recorded a pre-tax
        impairment charge of $10 million ($6 million after tax), which is included
        in
        "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

See
        Note
        15 for a discussion of the impairment of PPL Energy Supply's synthetic fuel
        production facilities recorded in 2006.

International

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Sales

In
        2002,
        PPL made a decision to exit its CEMAR investment after a series of impairment
        losses were recorded. At that time, PPL Global's remaining portion of its
        CEMAR
        investment was written-off. In 2004, PPL Global, which is included in the
        International Segment, sold its interest in CEMAR to two companies controlled
        by
        a private equity fund managed by GP Investimentos, a Brazilian private equity
        firm. The sale resulted in a credit of $23 million as a result of the reversal
        of the negative carrying value and the associated cumulative translation
        adjustment, which is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of
        Income.

In
        2004,
        PPL Global completed the sale of its minority interest in shares of CGE for
        $123
        million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax charge of $15 million ($7 million
        after
        tax), which is included in operating expenses as "Energy-related businesses"
        on
        the Statement of Income. This charge was due to the write-off of the associated
        cumulative translation adjustment, primarily as a result of the devaluation
        of
        the Chilean peso since the original acquisition in 2000.

In
        2005,
        WPD effectively sold an equity investment by transferring all risks and rewards
        of ownership of the two subsidiaries that held the investment, receiving
        $9
        million. The gain was deferred until WPD's continuing involvement in the
        subsidiaries ceased. In July 2006, WPD ceased involvement with one subsidiary.
        As a result, PPL Global recognized a pre-tax gain of $5 million, which is
        included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income. In December
        2006,
        WPD ceased involvement in the other subsidiary. PPL Global will recognize
        a
        pre-tax gain of $5 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the one-month
        lag
        in foreign subsidiary reporting.

In
        2006,
        PPL Global completed the sale of its minority interest in Aguaytia Energy,
        LLC,
        a combined generating and natural gas facility in Peru. PPL Global received
        $15
        million from the sale, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million, which is
        included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income.

Other

In
        2006,
        WPD received legal notification citing one of its real estate investments
        as an
        environmentally protected area, thus restricting planned development. An
        impairment assessment was performed based on a third-party appraisal. As
        a
        result, PPL Global recorded an impairment charge of $8 million ($6 million
        after
        tax), which is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of
        Income.

In
        2000,
        WPD acquired Hyder. Subsequently, WPD sold the majority of Hyder's
        non-electricity delivery businesses and placed the remaining companies in
        liquidation. In March 2006, WPD received $24 million in proceeds as an initial
        distribution related to the planned ongoing liquidation of the remaining
        non-electricity delivery businesses. In August 2006, WPD received an additional
        distribution of $4 million, of which $3 million was credited to income. These
        distributions are included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income.
        In December 2006, WPD received a further distribution of $4 million. This
        distribution will be included in the first quarter 2007 financial results
        due to
        the one-month lag in foreign subsidiary reporting. As of December 31, 2006,
        the
        Hyder non-electricity delivery businesses are substantially liquidated. WPD
        continues to operate the Hyder electricity delivery business.

Leases

Colstrip
        Generating Plant

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
        transaction. In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the Colstrip
        generating plants to owner lessors who are leasing a 50% interest in Colstrip
        Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3 back to PPL Montana under four
        36-year non-cancelable leases. This transaction is accounted for as an operating
        lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements related to
        sale/leaseback arrangements. These leases provide two renewal options based
        on
        the economic useful life of the generation assets. PPL Montana currently
        amortizes material leasehold improvements over no more than the remaining
        life
        of the original leases. PPL Montana is required to pay all expenses associated
        with the operations of the generation units. The leases place certain
        restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets
        and
        declare dividends and require PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios
        related to cash flow and net worth. There are no residual value guarantees
        in
        these leases. However, upon an event of default or an event of loss, PPL
        Montana
        could be required to pay a termination value of amounts sufficient to allow
        the
        lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor notes and make the lessor whole
        for
        its equity investment and anticipated return on investment. The events of
        default include payment defaults, breaches of representations or covenants,
        acceleration of other indebtedness of PPL Montana, change in control of PPL
        Montana and certain bankruptcy events. The termination value was estimated
        to be
        $661 million at December 31, 2006.

Other
        Leases

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
        September 2006, PPL's subsidiaries terminated the master lease agreements
        under
        which they leased equipment, such as vehicles, computers, and office equipment.
        In addition, PPL and its subsidiaries purchased the equipment from the lessors
        at a negotiated price. Prior to the buyout, PPL subsidiaries had been directly
        charged or allocated a portion of the rental expense related to the assets
        they
        utilized. In connection with the buyout, ownership of the purchased equipment
        was reviewed and attributed to the subsidiaries based on usage of the equipment.
        As a result, "Property, Plant and Equipment" increased on the Balance Sheet
        by
        $107 million for PPL, $29 million for PPL Energy Supply and $52 million for
        PPL
        Electric.

The
        following rent expense for all operating leases, including the Colstrip
        generating plant; equipment under the master lease agreements prior to September
        2006; office space; land; buildings; and other equipment, was primarily included
        in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

In
        connection with the acquisition of certain fiber optic network assets in

        subsidiary of PPL Telcom assumed a capital lease obligation through 2020
        for the
        right to use portions of this fiber optic network. The balances outstanding
        at
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, were $10 million and $11 million. Total future
        minimum rental payments for this capital lease are estimated at $1 million
        for
        each of the years from 2007 through 2011, and $11 million
        thereafter.

Stock-Based
        Compensation

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Effective
        January 1, 2006, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 123 (revised 2004),
        "Share-Based Payment," which is known as SFAS 123(R), using the modified
        prospective application transition method. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did
        not
        have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries, since PPL and its
        subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
        compensation, as described by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation," effective January 1, 2003. See Note 23 for further
        discussion of SFAS 123(R).

Under
        the
        PPL Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) and the Incentive Compensation Plan
        for
        Key Employees (ICPKE) (together, the Plans), restricted shares of PPL common
        stock, restricted stock units and stock options may be granted to officers
        and
        other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and other affiliated
        companies. Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation and Corporate
        Governance Committee (CCGC) of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of
        the
        ICP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council (CLC), in the case of the
        ICPKE. The ICP limits the total number of awards that may be granted under
        it
        after April 23, 1999, to 15,769,430 awards, or 5% of the total shares of
        PPL common stock that were outstanding at April 23, 1999. The ICPKE limits
        the
        total number of awards that may be granted under it after April 25, 2003,
        to
        16,573,608 awards, or 5% of the total shares of PPL common stock that were
        outstanding at January 1, 2003, reduced by outstanding awards for which PPL
        common stock was not yet issued as of April 25, 2003. In addition, each Plan
        limits the number of shares available for awards in any calendar year to
        2% of
        the outstanding common stock of PPL on the first day of such calendar year.
        The
        maximum number of options that can be awarded under each Plan to any single
        eligible employee in any calendar year is three million shares. Any portion
        of
        these options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any
        subsequent year. If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the
        participant terminate, the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an
        award
        are again available for grant. Shares delivered under the Plans may be in
        the
        form of authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury

Restricted
        Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted
        shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend
        rights. Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for key
        executives and have vesting periods as determined by the CCGC in the case
        of the
        ICP, and the CLC in the case of the ICPKE, that range from seven to 25 years.
        In
        addition, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under
        Plan
        provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.
        Restricted shares vest fully if control of PPL changes, as defined by the
        plans.

The
        Plans
        allow for the grant of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are
        awards
        based on the fair market value of PPL common stock. Actual PPL common shares
        will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally three years,
        as
        determined by the CCGC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in the case of
        the
        ICPKE. Recipients of restricted stock units may also be granted the right
        to
        receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or
        until
        the award is forfeited. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture
        or
        accelerated payout under the Plan provisions for termination, retirement,
        disability and death of employees. Restricted stock units vest fully if control
        of PPL changes, as defined by the Plans.

Stock
        Options

Under
        the
        Plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per
        share
        not less than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of
        grant.
        The options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming
        the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary, in installments
        as
        determined by the CCGC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in the case of
        the
        ICPKE. Options outstanding at December 31, 2006, become exercisable over
        a
        three-year period from the date of grant in equal installments. The CCGC
        and CLC
        have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options, except that
        the
        exercisability of an option issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless
        the individual remains employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from
        the
        date of grant. All options expire no later than ten years from the grant
        date.
        The options become exercisable immediately if control of PPL changes, as
        defined
        by the Plans.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options
        were
        insignificant for PPL Electric.

PPL
        received cash from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31,
        2006,
        of $21 million.

The
        estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes
        option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the model
        were:




Risk-free
                  interest rate

4.06%

3.79%

                  yield

3.76%

Based
        on
        the above assumptions, the weighted-average grant date fair values of options
        granted during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $4.86,
        $3.99 and $6.16.

PPL
        uses
        historical volatility and exercise behavior to value its stock options using
        the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model. Volatility over the expected term of
        the
        options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need
        to
        be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL's
        volatility in those prior periods. Management's expectations for future
        volatility, considering potential changes to PPL's business model and other
        economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data
        to
        determine the final volatility assumption.

Directors
        Stock Units

(PPL)

Under
        the
        Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, a mandatory amount of the cash retainers
        of the members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of PPL is
        deferred into stock units. Such deferred stock units represent shares of
        PPL's
        common stock to which the board members are entitled after they cease serving
        as
        a member of the Board of Directors. Board members also are entitled to defer
        any
        or all of their fees and cash retainers that are not part of the mandatory
        deferral into stock units. The stock unit accounts of each board member are
        increased based on dividends paid or other distributions on PPL's common
        stock.
        There were 305,088 such stock units outstanding at December 31, 2006.

Stock
        Appreciation Rights

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

WPD
        uses
        stock appreciation rights to compensate senior management employees. Stock
        appreciation rights are granted with a reference price to PPL's common stock
        at
        the date of grant. These awards vest over a three-year period and have a
        10-year
        term, during which time employees are entitled to receive a cash payment
        of any
        appreciation in the price of PPL's common stock over the grant date fair
        value.
        At December 31, 2006, there were 338,502 stock appreciation rights
        outstanding.

Retirement
        and Postemployment Benefits

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Pension
        and Other Postretirement Benefits

PPL
        and
        certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
        benefit plans. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting
        for
        Pensions" and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
        Other
        Than Pensions" when accounting for these benefits. In addition, PPL adopted
        the
        recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting
        for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December
        31, 2006.

SFAS
        requires a registrant that sponsors a defined benefit plan(s) to: (i) record
        an
        asset or liability to recognize the funded status of the plan(s) in its
        consolidated balance sheet using a measurement date that corresponds with
        its
        fiscal year end, and for a registrant's consolidated subsidiary, the date
        that
        is used to consolidate the subsidiary, (ii) recognize in other comprehensive
        income, net of tax, gains and losses and prior service costs and credits,
        that
        arise during the period but are not currently recognized as a component of
        net
        periodic benefit cost, (iii) amortize gains and losses, prior service costs
        and
        credits, and transition assets or obligations recorded in accumulated other
        comprehensive income to net periodic benefit cost, and (iv) provide additional
        disclosures of, among other things, items deferred in accumulated other
        comprehensive income. In accordance with SFAS 158, accounting and related
        disclosures for 2004 and 2005 were not affected by the adoption of the new
        standard. The incremental impact of adopting of SFAS 158, resulted in the
        following increases (decreases) to the Balance Sheet at December 31,
        2006.

                  158.

The
        majority of PPL's domestic employees are eligible for pension benefits under
        non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length
        of
        service and final average pay, as defined by the plans. Employees of PPL
        Montana
        are eligible for pension benefits under a cash balance pension plan and
        employees of certain of PPL's mechanical contracting companies are eligible
        for
        benefits under multi-employer plans sponsored by various unions. The employees
        of PPL's U.K. subsidiary, WPD, are eligible for benefits from one pension
        scheme
        with benefits based on length of service and final average pay. Retirees
        of
        PPL's Latin American subsidiaries may be eligible for coverage under
        government-sponsored and administered programs.

PPL
        and
        certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits
        to
        directors, executives and other key management employees through unfunded
        nonqualified retirement plans.

The
        majority of employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries will become eligible
        for
        certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through
        contributory plans. Postretirement benefits under the PPL Retiree Health
        Plan
        and PPL Gas Retiree Health Plan are paid from funded VEBA trusts sponsored
        by
        the respective companies. Postretirement benefits under the PPL Montana Retiree
        Health Plan are paid from company assets.

The
        following disclosures distinguish between domestic and international pension
        plans.

Net
        periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (credits)
        were:

(a)

The
                  $5 million cost of special termination benefits for 2005 was related
                  to
                  the WPD approved staff reduction plan as a result of the merger
                  of its two
                  control rooms, metering reorganization and other staff efficiencies.
                  Additional pension costs were recognized due to early retirement
                  and
                  pension enhancement provisions granted to the
                  employees.

(b)

The
                  $3 million cost of special termination benefits for 2006 was related
                  to
                  the PPL Susquehanna approved staff reduction plan. In addition,
                  severance
                  of $2 million was also recorded for a total pre-tax charge of $5
                  million
                  ($3 million after tax), or $0.01 per share for
                  PPL.

In
                  addition to the specific plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply,
                  PPL
                  Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus were also allocated
                  $26 million
                  of the costs of pension and other postretirement plans sponsored
                  by PPL
                  Services, included in the total cost above, based on their participation
                  in those plans.

(b)

PPL
                  Electric does not directly sponsor any pension or other postretirement
                  benefit plans. PPL Electric is allocated a portion of the costs
                  of pension
                  and other postretirement plans sponsored by PPL Services, based
                  on its
                  participation in those plans.

The
        following assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations
        at
        December 31 and determination of net periodic benefit cost for the years
        ended

        million and none at December 31, 2005.

In
        addition to the plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Generation
        subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus are allocated a portion of the liabilities
        and
        costs of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans sponsored by
        PPL
        Services based on their participation in those plans. PPL Energy Supply's
        allocated share of these pension liabilities was $35 million and $60 million
        at
        December 31, 2006 and 2005. PPL Energy Supply's allocated share of other
        postretirement benefits was a liability of $90 million at December 31, 2006
        and a prepaid asset of $1 million at December 31, 2005.

PPL
        Energy Supply's subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business
        make
        contributions to various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans,
        depending on an employee's status. Contributions of $48 million, $37 million
        and
        $28 million were made in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The change in contributions
        from
        year to year was primarily the result of the changes in the workforce at
        the
        mechanical contracting companies. The contribution rates have also increased
        from year to year.

(PPL
        Electric)

Although
        PPL Electric does not directly sponsor any pension or other postretirement
        benefit plans, it is allocated a portion of the liabilities and costs of
        plans
        sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those plans. At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the recorded balance of PPL Electric's
        allocated share of these pension liabilities was $45 million and $77 million.
        The balance for PPL Electric's allocated share of other postretirement benefits
        was a liability of $88 million at December 31, 2006, and a prepaid asset
        of $2
        million at December 31, 2005.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric had a regulatory asset of $3 million relating
        to
        the initial adoption of SFAS 106, which is being amortized and recovered
        in
        rates, with a remaining life of six years.

PPL
        Electric also maintains a liability for the cost of health care of retired
        miners of former subsidiaries that had been engaged in coal mining, as required
        by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. PPL Electric accounts
        for this liability under EITF 92-13, "Accounting for Estimated Payments in
        Connection with the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992." PPL
        Electric's net liability was $35 million at December 31, 2005. In the third
        quarter of 2006, PPL Electric was able to fully offset the net liability,
        calculated at that time, of $36 million, with excess Black Lung Trust assets
        as
        a result of the passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. At December
        31,
        2006, the net liability continues to be fully offset with excess Black Lung
        Trust assets. See "Pension Protection Act of 2006" within this note for further
        discussion.

The
        domestic pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers and
        are
        rebalanced as necessary to maintain the target asset allocation ranges. PPL's
        investment strategy with respect to the domestic pension assets is to achieve
        a
        satisfactory risk-adjusted return on assets that, in combination with PPL's
        funding policy and tolerance for return volatility, will ensure that sufficient
        dollars are available to provide benefit payments.

The
        expected long-term rate of return for PPL's domestic pension plans considers
        the
        plans' historical experience, but is primarily based on the plans' mix of
        assets
        and expectations for long-term returns of those asset classes.

PPL's
        investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations
        is to fund the VEBA trusts with voluntary contributions and to invest in
        a tax
        efficient manner utilizing a prudent mix of assets. Based on the current
        VEBA
        and postretirement plan structure, a targeted asset allocation range of 50%
        to
        60% equity and 40% to 50% debt is maintained.

The

In
        consultation with its investment advisor and with WPD, the group trustees
        of the
        WPD Group of the ESPS have drawn up a Statement of Investment Principles
        to
        comply with the requirements of U.K. legislation.

The
        group
        trustees' primary investment objective is to maximize investment returns
        within
        the constraint of avoiding excessive volatility in the funding
        position.

The
        expected rate of return for PPL and its subsidiaries' international pension
        plans considers that a portfolio largely invested in equities would be expected
        to achieve an average rate of return in excess of a portfolio largely invested
        in long-term bonds. The historical experience has been an excess return of
        2% to
        4% per annum on average over the return on long-term bonds.

Expected
        Cash Flows - Domestic Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
        Plans

(PPL)

There
        are
        no contributions required for PPL's primary domestic pension plan or any
        of
        PPL's other domestic subsidiary pension plans. However, PPL's domestic
        subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $27 million to their pension
        plans in 2007 to ensure future compliance with minimum funding
        requirements.

PPL
        sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets
        are segregated from corporate assets. PPL expects to make approximately $6
        million of benefit payments under these plans in 2007.

PPL
        is
        not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans
        but
        has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement
        benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would cause
        PPL to
        contribute $38 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
        2007.

The
        following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
        appropriate, are expected to be paid and the following federal subsidy payments

        Stock Ownership Plan

(PPL,

PPL
        sponsors a non-leveraged ESOP in which substantially all domestic employees,
        excluding those of PPL Montana, PPL Gas Utilities and the mechanical
        contractors, are enrolled on the first day of the month following eligible
        employee status. Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as ordinary dividends
        by PPL. Under existing income tax laws, PPL is permitted to deduct the amount
        of
        those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute the resulting tax
        savings (dividend-based contribution) to the ESOP.

The
        dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of PPL's common stock and
        is
        expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal
        income tax purposes. Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to eligible
        participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held
        in
        existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants'
        compensation.

Amounts
        charged as compensation expense for ESOP contributions were $7 million, $6
        million and $5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004. These amounts were offset
        by the
        dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on PPL's
        earnings.

ESOP
        shares outstanding at December 31, 2006, were 8,342,459 or 2% of total common
        shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations.

Postemployment
        Benefits

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Certain
        PPL subsidiaries provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled
        employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees.
        PPL
        follows the guidance of SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
        Benefits," when accounting for these benefits. Postemployment benefits charged
        to operating expenses were not significant for 2006. Postemployment benefits
        charged to operating expense for 2005 were $8 million for PPL, $4 million
        for
        PPL Energy Supply and $2 million for PPL Electric, primarily due to an updated
        valuation for Long-Term Disability benefits completed in 2005. Postemployment
        benefits were not significant in 2004.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Certain
        of PPL Global subsidiaries, including Emel, DelSur, Elfec and Integra, provide
        limited non-pension benefits to all current employees. All active employees
        are
        entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance
        with government-sponsored programs. These plans generally obligate a company
        to
        pay one month's salary per year of service to employees in the event of
        involuntary termination. Under certain plans, employees with five or more
        years
        of service are entitled to this payment in the event of voluntary or involuntary
        termination.

The
        liabilities for these plans are accounted for under the guidance of EITF
        88-1,
        "Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for a Defined Benefit Pension
        Plan,"
        using what is commonly referred to as the "shut down" method, where a company
        records the undiscounted obligation as if it were payable at each balance
        sheet
        date. The combined liabilities for these plans at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
        were $11 million and $10 million, and are recorded in "Deferred Credits and
        Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheets.

Pension
        Protection Act of 2006

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On
        August
        17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was signed by President
        Bush. The Act's changes, which will become effective in 2008, cover current
        pension plan legislation and funding rules for defined benefit pension plans.
        Based on the current funded status of PPL's defined benefit pension plans,
        the
        Act is not expected to have a significant impact on the future funding of
        these
        plans or have a significant financial impact on PPL, PPL Energy Supply or
        PPL
        Electric in regard to these plans.

(PPL
        and PPL Electric)

The
        Act
        does contain a provision that provides for excess assets held exclusively
        in
        Black Lung Trust funds to be used to pay for health benefits other than black
        lung disease for retired coal miners. Prior to recognition of this provision
        of
        the Act, PPL Electric had a net liability of $36 million for the medical
        costs
        of retirees of a PPL subsidiary represented by the United Mine Workers of
        America (UMWA). This subsidiary had a Black Lung Trust that was significantly
        overfunded. As a result of the Act and the ability to use the excess Black
        Lung
        Trust assets to make future benefit payments for the UMWA retiree medical
        costs,
        PPL Electric was able to fully offset the UMWA retiree medical liability
        on its
        Balance Sheet and record a one-time credit to PPL's and PPL Electric's "Other
        operation and maintenance" expense of $21 million (net of tax expense of
        $15
        million).

Jointly-Owned
        Facilities

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, subsidiaries of PPL and PPL Energy Supply owned
        interests in the facilities listed below. The Balance Sheets of PPL and PPL
        Energy Supply include the amounts noted in the following table.

(a)

A
                  PPL subsidiary had a 50% interest in a partnership that owned the
                  Griffith
                  gas-fired generating station. The partnership arrangement was essentially
                  a cost-sharing arrangement, in that each of the partners had rights
                  to
                  one-half of the plant capacity and energy, and an obligation to
                  cover
                  one-half of the operating costs of the station. Accordingly, the
                  equity
                  investment was classified as "Electric Plant in Service - Generation"
                  on
                  the Balance Sheet.

During
                  2006, PPL sold its 50% ownership interest in the Griffith plant.

                  10 for further discussion.

Each
        PPL
        Generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the facility.
        Each receives a portion of the total output of the generating stations equal
        to
        its percentage ownership. The share of fuel and other operating costs associated
        with the stations is included in the corresponding operating expenses on
        the
        Statements of Income.

In
        addition to the interests mentioned above, PPL Montana is the operator of
        the
        jointly-owned, coal-fired generating units comprising the Colstrip steam
        generation facility. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, PPL Montana had a 50%
        leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% leasehold interest
        in
        Colstrip Unit 3 under operating leases. See Note 11 for additional information.

PPL
        Montana's share of direct expenses associated with the operation and maintenance
        of these facilities is included in the corresponding operating expenses on
        the
        Statements of Income. Each joint-owner in these facilities provides its own
        financing. As operator of all Colstrip Units, PPL Montana invoices each
        joint-owner for its respective portion of the direct expenses. The amount
        due
        from joint-owners was $7 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

At
        December 31, 2006, NorthWestern owned a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip
        Unit
        4. PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's
        responsibilities regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, and
        each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction
        costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit
        or 4. However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related
        costs.

Energy
        Purchase Commitments

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply enter into long-term purchase contracts to supply the fuel
        requirements for generation facilities. These include contracts to purchase
        coal, emission allowances, natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel. These contracts
        extend for terms through 2019. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into
        long-term contracts for the storage and transportation of natural gas. These
        contracts extend through 2014 and 2032. Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy
        Supply
        have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power that extend for terms
        through 2010, excluding the windfarm and Longview Power, LLC agreements
        discussed below.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply entered into long-term power purchase agreements with two
        wind
        project developers to purchase the full output of their facilities when they
        begin commercial operation. These contracts extend for terms through
        2026.

As
        part
        of the purchase of generation assets from Montana Power, PPL Montana assumed
        a
        power purchase agreement, which was still in effect at December 31, 2006.
        In accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, PPL Montana recorded a
        liability of $58 million as the estimated fair value of the agreement at
        the
        acquisition date. The liability is being reduced over the term of the agreement,
        through 2010, as an adjustment to "Energy purchases" on the Statements of
        Income. The unamortized balance of the liability related to the agreement
        at
        December 31, 2006, was $42 million, of which $34 million is included in
        "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" and $8 million
        is included in "Current Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheets.

In
        1998,
        PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual for above-market contracts with NUGs
        of
        $879 million, due to the deregulation of its generation business. Effective
        January 1999, PPL Electric began reducing this liability as an offset to
        "Energy
        purchases" on the Statements of Income. This reduction is based on the estimated
        timing of the purchases from the NUGs and projected market prices for this
        generation. The final NUG contract expires in 2014. In connection with the
        corporate realignment in 2000, the remaining balance of this liability was
        transferred to PPL EnergyPlus. At December 31, 2006, the remaining liability
        associated with the above-market NUG contracts was $136 million.

In
        2006,
        PPL entered into a long-term coal purchase agreement with CONSOL Energy Inc.
        The
        contract will provide more than one-third of PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's
        projected coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2008 through
        2018.

In
        January 2007, PPL EnergyPlus entered into a fixed price contract with Longview
        Power, LLC, to financially purchase 300 MW of energy and capacity from a
        new
        coal-fired generating facility to be built in West Virginia. The power purchase
        agreement begins in January 2012 and expires in December 2016, with an option
        to
        extend at a fixed price through December 2017.

Energy
        Sales Commitments

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        Energy Supply enters into long-term power sales contracts in connection with
        its
        load-serving activities or associated with certain of its power plants. These
        power sales contracts extend for terms through 2017. All long-term contracts
        were executed at pricing that approximated market rates, including profit
        margin, at the time of execution.

In
        July
        2002, PPL Montana began to sell to NorthWestern an aggregate of 450 MW of
        energy. Under two five-year agreements with terms through June 30, 2007,
        PPL
        Montana is supplying 300 MW of around-the-clock electricity and 150 MW of
        unit-contingent on-peak electricity. PPL Montana also makes short-term energy
        sales to NorthWestern. In July 2006, PPL Montana entered into a new seven-year
        power purchase and sale agreement with NorthWestern pursuant to which PPL
        Montana will provide the following wholesale electricity supply to
        NorthWestern:

                  MW

In
        2002,
        PPL began commercial operations of its Edgewood natural gas-fired generating
        station and its Shoreham oil-fired generating station. Each of these New
        York
        plants has a capacity of 79.9 MW. Initially, the Long Island Power Authority
        contracted to purchase all of Edgewood's capacity and ancillary services
        as part
        of a three-year power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus beginning at
        commercial operation, and all of Shoreham's capacity and ancillary services
        as
        part of a 15-year power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus beginning
        at
        commercial operation. In 2005, PPL EnergyPlus extended the Edgewood power
        purchase agreement for an additional term that runs through October 2008.
        The
        Shoreham power purchase agreement remains in effect until 2017.

In
        January 2004, PPL EnergyPlus began supplying 12.5% of Connecticut Light &
Power Company's (CL&P) Transitional Standard Offer load under a three-year
        fixed-price contract. During peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply
        the Transitional Standard Offer load may reach 625 MW. In January 2006, PPL
        EnergyPlus began to supply an additional 6.25% of CL&P's Transitional
        Standard Offer load under a one-year fixed-price contract. During peak hours,
        PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the Transitional Standard Offer load
        may
reach 313 MW. In September 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into an agreement
        to
        supply an additional 10% of CL&P's Transitional Standard Offer load under a
        two-year fixed-price contract, commencing January 1, 2007. During peak hours,
        PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the Transitional Standard Offer load
        may
        reach 450 MW.

As
        a
        result of New Jersey's Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, the
        New
        Jersey Board of Public Utilities authorized and made available to power
        suppliers, on a competitive basis, the opportunity to provide Basic Generation
        Service (BGS) to all non-shopping New Jersey customers. In February 2003,
        PPL
        EnergyPlus was awarded 34-month fixed-price BGS contracts for a fixed percentage
        of customer load (an aggregate of 1,000 MW) for Atlantic City Electric Company
        (ACE), Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCPL) and Public Service
        Electric & Gas Company (PSEG). These contracts commenced in August 2003. In
        the first quarter of 2005, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded a portion of the
        Commercial Industrial Energy Pricing tranche, which amounts to 85 MW after
        expected shopping. These 12-month contracts ended in June 2006. In February
        2006, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded 36-month fixed-price BGS contracts for fixed
        percentages of customer load (an aggregate of 600 MW) for ACE, JCPL and PSEG.
        These contracts commenced in June 2006. Additionally, in February 2007, PPL
        EnergyPlus was a successful bidder for fixed-priced BGS contracts for a
        percentage of customer load in New Jersey for those retail customers who
        have
        not shopped for competitive electricity.

In
        December 2005 and January 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into agreements with
        Delmarva Power and Light Company to provide a portion of its full requirements
        service from May 2006 through May 2008. Additionally, in November 2006, PPL
        EnergyPlus entered into an agreement with Delmarva Power and Light Company
        to
        provide a portion of its full requirements service from June 2007 through
        May
        2010.

As
        a
        result of the Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Law of 1997,
        the
        Illinois General Assembly provided the opportunity for power suppliers to
        compete for the full requirements electric supply of all non-shopping Illinois
        customers. In September 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into three agreements
        with
        Commonwealth Edison Company to provide a portion of its full requirements
        service. These agreements commence in January 2007 and expire after 17, 29
        and
        41 months. During peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the load
        may
        reach 700 MW.

In
        September 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into agreements with Metropolitan
        Edison
        Company and Pennsylvania Electric Company to provide a portion of their full
        requirements service from December 2006 through December 2008. During peak
        hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the load may have reached 250
        MW;
        however, these agreements were subsequently cancelled by mutual agreement
        in
        February 2007.

In
        December 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into an agreement with Western
        Massachusetts Electric Company to provide a portion of their full requirements
        service. This agreement commences in January 2007 and expires in December
        2007.
        During peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the load may reach
        MW.

Additionally,
        in December 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into an agreement with The United
        Illuminating Company to provide a portion of their full requirements service.
        This agreement commences in January 2008 and expires in December 2008. During
        peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the load may reach 300
        MW.

PPL
        Montana Hydroelectric License Commitments

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        Montana has 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed
        by
        the FERC pursuant to the Federal Power Act under long-term licenses. Pursuant
        to
        Section 8(e) of the Federal Power Act, the FERC approved the transfer from
        Montana Power to PPL Montana of all pertinent licenses and any amendments
        in
        connection with the Montana Asset Purchase Agreement.

The
        Kerr
        Dam Project license was jointly issued by the FERC to Montana Power and the
        Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation in 1985,
        and
        required Montana Power to hold and operate the project for 30 years. The
        license
        required Montana Power, and subsequently PPL Montana as a result of the purchase
        of the Kerr Dam from Montana Power, to continue to implement a plan to mitigate
        the impact of the Kerr Dam on fish, wildlife and the habitat. Under this
        arrangement, PPL Montana has a remaining commitment to spend $18 million
        between
        2007 and 2015, at which point the tribes have the option through 2025 to
        purchase, hold and operate the project.

PPL
        Montana entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with state, federal
        and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the FERC renewal
        license
        for the nine dams for the Missouri-Madison project. The MOUs require PPL
        Montana
        to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish, wildlife
        and
        the habitat, and to increase recreational opportunities. The MOUs were created
        to maximize collaboration between the parties and enhance the possibility
        for
        matching funds from relevant federal agencies. Under this arrangement, PPL
        Montana has a remaining commitment to spend $34 million between 2007 and
        2040.

Legal
        Matters

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation
        in the
        ordinary course of business. PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the
        outcome
        of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material
        liabilities.

Montana
        Power Shareholders' Litigation

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        August
        2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders
        of
        Montana Power against Montana Power, the directors of Montana Power, certain
        advisors and consultants of Montana Power, and PPL Montana. The plaintiffs
        allege, among other things, that Montana Power was required to, and did not,
        obtain shareholder approval of the sale of Montana Power's generation assets
        to
        PPL Montana in 1999, and thus that sale "was null and void ab initio." Among
        the
        remedies that the plaintiffs are seeking is the establishment of a "resulting
        and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets and all profits
        earned
        by PPL Montana from the generation assets, plus interest on the amounts subject
        to the trust. This lawsuit has been pending in the U.S. District Court of
        Montana, Butte Division, and the judge has placed this proceeding on hold
        pending the outcome of certain motions currently before the U.S. Bankruptcy
        Court for the District of Delaware, the resolution of which may impact this
        proceeding. PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this
        matter.

Montana
        Hydroelectric Litigation

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation and PacifiCorp commenced an
        action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court
        seeking
        a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for their
        hydropower facilities' use and occupancy of streambeds in Montana can be
        collected by the State of Montana. This request for declaratory judgment
        from
        the Montana state court was brought following the dismissal of the State
        of
        Montana's federal lawsuit seeking such payments or compensation in the U.S.
        District Court of Montana, Missoula Division, due to lack of diversity
        jurisdiction. The State's federal lawsuit was founded on allegations that
        the
        bed of Montana's navigable rivers became state-owned property upon Montana's
        admission to statehood, and that the use of them for placement of dam
        structures, affiliated structures and reservoirs should, under an existing
        regulatory scheme, trigger lease payments for use of land underneath. In
        July
        2006, the Montana state court approved a stipulation by the State of Montana
        that it is not seeking any lease payments or other compensation from PPL
        Montana
        for the period prior to PPL Montana's acquisition of the hydropower facilities
        in December 1999.

The
        trial
        for this state court proceeding has been scheduled to commence in October
        2007.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Regulatory
        Issues

California
        ISO and Western Markets

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Through
        its subsidiaries, PPL made $18 million of sales to the California ISO during
        the
        period from October 2000 through June 2001, of which $17 million has not
        been
        paid to PPL subsidiaries. Given the myriad of electricity supply problems
        presently faced by the California electric utilities and the California ISO,
        PPL
        cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. At December 31, 2006,
        PPL has fully reserved for underrecoveries of payments for these
        sales.

Regulatory
        proceedings arising out of the California electricity supply situation have
        been
        filed at the FERC. The FERC has determined that all sellers of energy into
        markets operated by the California ISO and the California Power Exchange,
        including PPL Montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period
        beginning October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, but the FERC has not yet
        ruled
        on the exact amounts that the sellers, including PPL Montana, would be required
        to refund. In decisions in September 2004 and August 2006, the U.S. Court
        of
        Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the FERC had the additional legal
        authority to order refunds for periods prior to October 2, 2000, and ordered
        the
        FERC to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to grant such
        additional refunds. As part of its August 2006 decision, the Court stayed
        the
        time to petition for rehearing of the decision and its mandate to the FERC
        in
        order to allow the parties time to conduct settlement discussions.

In
        June
        2003, the FERC took several actions as a result of a number of related
        investigations. The FERC terminated proceedings to consider whether to order
        refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the Pacific Northwest, including
        sales made by PPL Montana, during the period December 2000 through June 2001.
        The FERC also commenced additional investigations relating to "gaming" and
        bidding practices during 2000 and 2001, but, to their knowledge, neither
        PPL
        EnergyPlus nor PPL Montana is a subject of these investigations.

Litigation
        arising out of the California electricity supply situation has been filed
        in
        California courts against sellers of energy to the California ISO. The
        plaintiffs and intervenors in these legal proceedings allege, among other
        things, abuse of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade
        practices and violations of state antitrust laws, and seek other relief,
        including treble damages and attorneys' fees. While PPL's subsidiaries have
        not
        been named by the plaintiffs in these legal proceedings, one defendant in
        a
        consolidated court proceeding named PPL Montana in its cross-complaint; this
        defendant denied any unlawful conduct but asserted that, if it is found liable,
        the other generators and power marketers, including PPL Montana, caused,
        contributed to and/or participated in the plaintiffs' alleged losses. In
        July
        2006, the Court dismissed this case as the result of a settlement under which
        PPL Montana was not required to make any payments or provide any
        compensation.

In
        February 2004, the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated a limited
        investigation of the Montana retail electricity market for the years 2000
        and
        2001, focusing on how that market was affected by transactions involving
        the
        possible manipulation of the electricity grid in the western U.S. The
        investigation includes all public utilities and licensed electricity suppliers
        in Montana, including PPL Montana, as well as other entities that may possess
        relevant information. In June 2004, the Montana Attorney General served PPL
        Montana and more than 20 other companies with subpoenas requesting documents,
        and PPL Montana has provided responsive documents to the Montana Attorney
        General.

While
        PPL
        and its subsidiaries believe that they have not engaged in any improper trading
        or marketing practices affecting the California and western markets, PPL
        cannot
        predict the outcome of the above-described investigations, lawsuits and
        proceedings or whether any PPL subsidiaries will be the target of any additional
        governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings.

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
        December 2002, PPL was served with a complaint against PPL, PPL EnergyPlus
        and
        PPL Electric filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
        Pennsylvania by a group of 14 Pennsylvania boroughs that apparently alleged,
        among other things, violations of the federal antitrust laws in connection
        with
        the pricing of installed capacity in the PJM daily market during the first
        quarter of 2001 and certain breach of contract claims. These boroughs were
        wholesale customers of PPL Electric. In April 2006, the Court dismissed all
        of
        the federal antitrust claims and all of the breach of contract claims except
        for
        one breach of contract claim by one of the boroughs.

Each
        of
        the U.S. Department of Justice - Antitrust Division, the FERC and the
        Pennsylvania Attorney General conducted investigations regarding PPL's PJM
        capacity market transactions in early 2001 and did not find any reason to
        take
        action against PPL.

New
        England Investigation

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        January 2004, PPL became aware of an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney
        General and the FERC's Office of Market Oversight and Investigation (OMOI)
        regarding allegations that natural gas-fired generators located in New England
        illegally sold natural gas instead of generating electricity during the week
        of
        January 12, 2004. PPL has responded to a data request of OMOI that indicated
        that PPL was not under suspicion of a regulatory violation, but that OMOI
        was
        conducting an initial investigation. PPL also has responded to data requests
        of
        ISO New England and data requests served by subpoena from the Connecticut
        Attorney General. Both OMOI and ISO New England have issued preliminary reports
        finding no regulatory or other violations concerning these matters. While
        PPL
        does not believe that it committed any regulatory or other violations concerning
        the subject matter of these investigations, PPL cannot predict the outcome
        of
        these investigations.

PJM
        Billing

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
        December 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy,
        Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC
        alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as
        a
        result of an error by PJM in the State Estimator Model used in connection
        with
        billing all PJM customers for certain transmission, spot market energy and
        ancillary services charges. Specifically, the complaint alleged that PJM
        mistakenly identified PPL Electric's Elroy substation transformer as belonging
        to PECO and that, as a consequence, during times of congestion, PECO's bills
        for
        transmission congestion from PJM erroneously reflected energy that PPL Electric
        took from the Elroy substation and used to serve PPL Electric's load. The
        complaint requested the FERC, among other things, to direct PPL Electric
        to
        refund to PJM $39 million, plus interest of $8 million, and for PJM to refund
        these same amounts to PECO.

In
        April
        2005, the FERC determined that PECO was entitled to reimbursement for the
        transmission congestion charges that PECO asserts PJM erroneously billed
        to it
        at the Elroy substation. The FERC set for additional proceedings before a
        judge
        the determination of the amount of the overcharge to PECO and which PJM market
        participants were undercharged and therefore are responsible for reimbursement
        to PECO.

PPL
        Electric recognized an after-tax charge of $27 million (or $0.07 per share
        for
        PPL) in the first quarter of 2005 for a loss contingency related to this
        matter.
        The pre-tax accrual was $47 million, with $39 million included in "Energy
        purchases" on the Statement of Income, and $8 million in "Interest
        Expense."

In
        September 2005, PPL Electric and Exelon Corporation filed a proposed settlement
        agreement regarding this matter with the FERC. In March 2006, the FERC rejected
        the settlement agreement indicating that the agreement involves material
        issues
        of fact that it cannot decide without further information, and ordered the
        matter to be set for hearing.

Subsequently,
        in March 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC a new proposed
        settlement agreement under which PPL Electric would have paid approximately
        $41
        million over a five-year period to PJM through a new transmission charge.
        Pursuant to this proposed agreement, PJM would have forwarded the amounts
        collected under this new charge to PECO.

In
        November 2006, the FERC entered an order accepting the parties' March 2006
        proposed settlement agreement, upon the condition that PPL Electric agree
        to
        certain modifications. The FERC's acceptance was conditioned upon reimbursement
        to PECO through a single credit to PECO's monthly PJM bill and a corresponding
        charge on PPL Electric's monthly PJM bill, rather than through a PJM Tariff
        transmission charge applicable only to PPL Electric. The FERC ordered PPL
        Electric to advise the FERC within 30 days as to whether it would accept
        or
        reject the proposed modifications.

In
        December 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC, pursuant to the
        November 2006 order, a modified offer of settlement ("Compliance Filing").
        Under
        the Compliance Filing, which must be approved by the FERC, PPL Electric would
        make a single payment through its monthly PJM bill of $38 million, plus interest
        through the date of payment, and PJM would include a single credit for this
        amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill. Through December 31, 2006, the estimated
        interest on this payment would be $4 million, for a total PPL Electric payment
        of $42 million.

Based
        on
        the terms of the Compliance Filing and the effective date and provisions
        of
        power supply agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, PPL has
        determined that PPL Electric is responsible for the claims prior to July
        1, 2000
        (totaling $12 million), and that PPL EnergyPlus is responsible for the claims
        subsequent to that date (totaling $30 million).

Based
        on
        the Compliance Filing, PPL and PPL Electric reduced the recorded loss accrual
        by
        $5 million (or $0.01 per share for PPL) at December 31, 2006. PPL Electric
        also
        recorded a receivable from PPL EnergyPlus of $30 million at December 31,
        2006,
        for the portion of the claims allocated to PPL EnergyPlus. As a result of
        the
        reduction of the loss accrual and the allocation to PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric
        recorded credits to expense of $35 million on the Statement of Income, including
        $28 million of "Energy purchases" and $7 million of "Interest Expense."

PPL
        Energy Supply recorded a loss accrual of $30 million at December 31, 2006,
        for
        its share of the claims, and recorded a corresponding payable to PPL Electric.
        PPL EnergyPlus recorded $27 million of "Energy purchases" and $3 million
        of
        "Interest Expense" on the Statement of Income.

PPL,
        PPL
        Electric and PPL Energy Supply cannot be certain if or when the FERC will
        approve the Compliance Filing. Management will continue to assess the loss
        accrual for this contingency in future periods.

FERC
        Market-Based Rate Authority

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        December 1998, the FERC issued an order authorizing PPL EnergyPlus to make
        wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates.
        In
        that order, the FERC directed PPL EnergyPlus to file an updated market analysis
        within three years of the date of the order, and every three years thereafter.
        The most recent market-based rate filings with the FERC were made in November
        2004 by PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of PPL Generation's
        subsidiaries. These filings consisted of a Western market-based rate filing
        for
        PPL Montana and an Eastern market-based rate filing for most of the other
        PPL
        subsidiaries in the PJM region.

In
        September 2005, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the Eastern
        market-based rate filing, subject to PPL subsidiaries making a compliance
        filing
        providing further support that they cannot erect other non-transmission barriers
        to entry into the generation market. The PPL subsidiaries made this compliance
        filing in October 2005, which the FERC accepted.

In

May
        2006,
        the FERC issued an order rejecting the claims of the various parties in the
        proceeding regarding PPL's Western market-based rate filing and granting
        PPL
        Montana market-based rate authority in NorthWestern's control area. There
        are
        two outstanding requests for rehearing of the FERC's order, and the FERC
        has
        issued a routine order allowing more time to consider these rehearing requests.
        While PPL Montana continues to believe that it does not have market power
        in
        NorthWestern's control area and that it has no obligations to make additional
        sales of power to NorthWestern regardless of the outcome of this proceeding,
        it
        cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

Currently,
        if a seller is granted market-based rate authority by the FERC, it may enter
        into power contracts during the time period for which such authority has
        been
        granted. If the FERC determines that the market is not workably competitive
        or
        the seller possesses market power or is not charging just and reasonable
        rates,
        the FERC institutes prospective action. Any contracts entered into pursuant
        to
        the FERC's market-based rate authority remain in effect and are generally
        subject to a high standard of review before the FERC can order any changes.
        Recent court decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
        have
        raised issues that may make it more difficult for the FERC to continue its
        program of promoting wholesale electricity competition through market-based
        rate
        authority. These court decisions permit retroactive refunds and a lower standard
        of review by the FERC for changing power contracts, and could have the effect
        of
        requiring the FERC to review in advance most, if not all, power contracts.
        The
        FERC has not yet taken action in response to these recent court decisions,
        and
        the decisions have been or are expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
        Court. At this time, PPL cannot predict the impact of these court decisions
        on
        the FERC's future market-based rate authority program or on PPL's
        business.

Wallingford
        Cost-Based Rates

(

PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        January 2003, PPL negotiated an agreement with ISO New England that would
        declare that four of the five units at PPL's Wallingford, Connecticut facility
        are "reliability must run" (RMR) units and put those units under cost-based
        rates. This RMR agreement and the cost-based rates are subject to approval
        by
        the FERC. In May 2003, the FERC denied PPL's request for approval of the
        RMR
        agreement and cost-based rates, but in August 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals
        for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the FERC's denial and remanded
        the
        case to the FERC for further consideration. In April 2006, the FERC
        conditionally approved the RMR agreement and the cost-based rates for the
        four
        Wallingford units, effective February 1, 2003, subject to refund, hearing
        and
        settlement procedures. The FERC ordered a hearing to determine whether the
        Wallingford units needed the RMR agreement, the proposed cost-based rates
        under
        the RMR agreement and the amounts to be recovered for past periods under
        the RMR
        agreement. Any rates collected under the RMR agreement prior to the completion
        of the hearing and/or settlement proceedings are subject to refund pending
        the
        outcome of the proceedings. The hearing has been held in abeyance pending
        the
        outcome of the settlement proceedings among the interested parties.

In
        September 2006, PPL and certain of the parties filed a written settlement
        with
        the FERC. The settlement is unopposed. If approved by the FERC, the settlement
        would resolve all issues in the pending proceeding, including payments to
        PPL
        for the past period and going forward. Under the terms of the settlement,
        PPL
        would receive a total of $44 million in settlement of amounts due under the
        RMR
        agreement for the period February 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006. This amount
        (plus interest) would be paid to PPL in approximately equal monthly installments
        over a two-year period. In addition, PPL would enter into a revised RMR
        Agreement effective as of June 1, 2006, under which it would be entitled
        to
        receive $2 million per month for its recovery of fixed costs while the agreement
        remains in effect. PPL has deferred $11 million of payments related to the
        pending RMR settlement as of December 31, 2006. In October 2006, the
        administrative law judge assigned to this matter certified the settlement
        to the
        FERC for its consideration as an uncontested settlement.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply currently expect that the four Wallingford RMR units will
        begin to participate in ISO New England's locational forward reserve market
        in
        June 2007, at which time the revised RMR Agreement would terminate in accordance
        with the settlement provided certain conditions are met. The ISO New England
        locational forward reserve market provides revenues to peaking generation
        that
        can quickly come on line from reserve status to meet reliability
        requirements.

PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply cannot predict whether or when the FERC will approve this
        settlement agreement or the ultimate outcome of this matter.

Montana
        Public Service Commissioner's Litigation

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        May
        2006, one of the commissioners of the Montana PSC commenced an action in
        Montana
        First Judicial District Court against PPL Montana and the Montana PSC seeking
        to
        cause the Montana PSC to reverse its 1999 order consenting to

EWG
        status for

PPL
        Montana's power plants.

In
        1999,
        the FERC had granted the plants EWG status and the authority to sell electricity
        produced at market-based rates, and the Montana PSC consented to this status
        for
        PPL Montana's plants under a provision of federal law. In September 2006,
        the
        Court granted

PPL
        Montana's and the Montana PSC's motions to dismiss this action. The plaintiff
        has appealed the dismissal of the lawsuit to the Montana Supreme Court. PPL
        and
        PPL Energy Supply continue to believe that this lawsuit is groundless and
        beyond
        the statute of limitations period, but cannot predict the outcome of this
        matter.

IRS
        Synthetic Fuels Tax Credits

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL,
        through its subsidiaries, has interests in two synthetic fuel production
        facilities: the Somerset facility located in Pennsylvania and the Tyrone
        facility located in Kentucky. PPL receives tax credits pursuant to Section
        29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code based on the sale of synthetic fuel from
        these facilities. Section 29/45K tax credits are currently scheduled to expire
        at the end of 2007.

To
        qualify for the Section 29/45K tax credits, the synthetic fuel must meet
        three
        primary conditions: (i) there must be a significant chemical change in the
        coal
        feedstock, (ii) the product must be sold to an unaffiliated entity, and (iii)
        the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1,
        1998.

In
        addition, Section 29/45K provides for the synthetic fuel tax credit to begin
        to
        phase out when the relevant annual reference price for crude oil, which is
        the
        domestic first purchase price (DFPP), falls within a designated range and
        to be
        eliminated when the DFPP exceeds the range. The phase-out range is adjusted
        annually for inflation. Currently, the DFPP is published by the IRS annually
        in
        April for the prior year and is calculated based on the annual average wellhead
        price per barrel for all unregulated domestic crude oil.

PPL
        cannot predict with any certainty the final DFPP reference price for crude
        oil
        for 2006 or 2007 or the phase-out range for either year. Accounting for
        inflation, PPL currently estimates the phase-out range for 2006 to begin
        at
        about $54 per barrel (DFPP) and the tax credits to be totally eliminated
        at
        about $68 per barrel (DFPP). Accounting for inflation, PPL currently estimates
        the phase-out range for 2007 to begin at about $56 per barrel (DFPP) and
        the tax
        credits to be totally eliminated at about $70 per barrel (DFPP). PPL expects
        a
        phase-out of approximately 35% of the gross tax credits produced in 2006,
        based
        on its estimate of the DFPP reference price and the phase-out range applicable
        for 2006. If the price of crude oil increases above current price levels
        in
        2007, PPL's synthetic fuel tax credits for 2007 could be significantly reduced
        or eliminated.

Since
        PPL
        began the synthetic fuel operations, the synthetic fuel produced at the Somerset
        and Tyrone facilities has resulted in an aggregate recognition of an estimated
        $291 million and $94 million of tax credits as of December 31, 2006, including
        estimated amounts for 2006. As of December 31, 2006, PPL is estimating the
        2006 phase-out to be 35%, resulting in the recognition of $23 million of
        tax
        credits for Somerset and $32 million of tax credits for Tyrone for the year
        ending December 31, 2006. An estimated $12 million of the gross tax credits
        for
        Somerset and $18 million for Tyrone are not expected to be recognized for
        the
        year ending December 31, 2006, due to the phase-out range and estimated DFPP
        reference price.

In
        2005,
        PPL entered into economic hedge transactions that serve to mitigate some
        of the
        earnings and cash flow impact of increases in DFPP crude oil prices for 2006
        and
        2007. In 2006, PPL entered into additional economic hedge transactions for
        this
        purpose. The mark-to-market value of these hedges is reflected in
        "Energy-related businesses" revenues on the Statements of Income. PPL has
        entered into additional economic hedge transactions for 2007 that are expected
        to mitigate PPL's tax credit phase-out risk due to an increase of the DFPP
        reference price in 2007. Such hedge transactions are not intended to mitigate
        any ongoing operational or production risks associated with the Tyrone and
        Somerset facilities.

Based
        on
        forecasted oil prices and other considerations, in early April 2006, PPL
        temporarily suspended operations at its Somerset facility. In August 2006,
        operations resumed at the Somerset facility. The Tyrone facility operated
        throughout 2006.

PPL
        performed impairment reviews of both its synthetic fuel production facilities
        during the second quarter of 2006. The reviews were prompted by the Somerset
        suspension, the uncertainty surrounding the future operations of each of
        the
        facilities and continued observed and forecasted high crude oil prices. PPL
        determined that the net book value of the facilities exceeded the projected
        undiscounted cash flows. Therefore, in the second quarter of 2006, PPL recorded
        charges totaling $10 million ($6 million after tax, or $0.01 per share for
        PPL)
        to fully impair its synfuel-related assets based on an internal model and
        other
        analysis. The impairment charges are reflected in "Energy-related businesses"
        expense on PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Income. The assets
        of the
        facilities are a component of the Supply segment.

PPL
        also
        purchases synthetic fuel from unaffiliated third parties, at prices below
        the
        market price of coal, for use at its coal-fired power plants. In 2005 and
        2006,
        PPL's purchases from these third parties resulted in fuel cost savings of
        $24
        million and $18 million. PPL estimates that, unless these third parties
        discontinue their synthetic fuel operations and sales to PPL due to the impact
        of projected DFPP oil prices, its purchases from these parties will result
        in
        fuel cost savings in 2007 of $24 million assuming full production throughout
        the
        year.

In
        October 2003, it was reported that the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
        on
        Investigations, of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, had begun an
        investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and its producers. That
        investigation is ongoing. PPL cannot predict when the investigation will
        be
        completed or the potential results of the investigation.

Energy
        Policy Act of 2005

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
        August
        2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005
        Energy Act). The 2005 Energy Act is comprehensive legislation that will
        substantially affect the regulation of energy companies.

The
        Act
        amends federal energy laws and provides the FERC with new oversight
        responsibilities.

Among
        the
        important changes that have been or will be implemented as a result of this
        legislation are:

The
        implementation of the 2005 Energy Act requires proceedings at the state level
        and the development of regulations, some of which have not been finalized,
        by
        the FERC, the DOE and other federal agencies. PPL cannot predict when all
        of
        these proceedings and regulations will be finalized.

Upon
        implementation, the Reliability Standards will have the force and effect
        of law,
        and will apply to all users of the bulk power electricity system, including
        electric utility companies, generators and marketers. The FERC has indicated
        that it intends to vigorously enforce the Reliability Standards using, among
        other means, civil penalty authority. At this time, PPL cannot predict the
        impact that compliance with the Reliability Standards will have on PPL,
        including its capital and operating expenditures, but such compliance costs
        could be significant.

PPL
        also
        cannot predict with certainty the impact of the other provisions of the 2005
        Energy Act and any related regulations on PPL and its subsidiaries.

Environmental
        Matters - Domestic

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Due
        to
        the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters,
        PPL
        subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain
        facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory
        bodies
        or courts. In this regard, PPL subsidiaries also may incur capital expenditures
        or operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could
        be
        significant.

Air

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

The
        Clean
        Air Act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal ambient ozone
        standards, particulate matter standards and toxic air emissions and visibility
        in the U.S. Amendments to the Clean Air Act requiring additional emission
        reductions are likely to continue to be brought up for consideration in the
        U.S.
        Congress. The Clean Air Act allows states to develop more stringent regulations
        and in some instances, as further discussed below, Pennsylvania and Montana
        have
        chosen to do so.

Citing
        its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has developed new standards
        for
        ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the U.S. These standards
        have
        been upheld following court challenges. To facilitate attainment of these
        standards, the EPA has promulgated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) for
        midwestern and eastern states, including Pennsylvania, to reduce sulfur dioxide
        emissions by about 50% by 2010 and to extend the current seasonal program
        for
        reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides to a year-round program starting
        in
        2009. The CAIR requires further reductions, starting in 2015, in sulfur dioxide
        and nitrogen oxides of 30% and 20%, respectively, from 2010 levels. The CAIR
        allows these reductions to be achieved through cap-and-trade programs.
        Pennsylvania has not challenged the CAIR, but the rule has been challenged
        by
        several states and environmental groups as not being sufficiently strict,
        and by
        industry petitioners as being too strict. In addition, several Canadian
        environmental groups have petitioned the EPA under the Clean Air Act to revise
        the CAIR to require deeper reductions in sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions,
        and the Ozone Transport Commission (consisting of Pennsylvania and 11 other
        states and the District of Columbia) has passed a resolution calling for
        reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are more stringent
        than
        those under CAIR. The Pennsylvania DEP, which represents Pennsylvania on
        the
        Ozone Transport Commission, has indicated its support for developing regulations
        for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are more stringent
        than those under CAIR.

In
        order
        to continue meeting existing sulfur dioxide reduction requirements of the
        Clean
        Air Act, including CAIR, PPL is installing sulfur dioxide scrubbers at its
        Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner Island Unit 3, and a scrubber at Brunner
        Island Units 1 and 2. The scrubbers for both Montour units and Unit 3 at
        Brunner
        Island are expected to be in-service during 2008 and the scrubber for Units
        and 2 at Brunner Island is expected to be in-service during 2009. Based on
        expected levels of generation and projected emission allowance prices, PPL
        has
        determined that it is more economic to install these scrubbers than to purchase
        significant additional emission allowances to make up the emission allowance
        shortfalls that would otherwise occur. In order to meet the year-round
        reductions in nitrogen oxides under CAIR, PPL's current plan is to operate
        the
        SCRs at Montour Units 1 and 2 year-round, optimize emission reductions from
        the
        existing combustion controls and purchase any needed emission allowances.
        PPL's
        current installation plan for the scrubbers and other pollution control
        equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate, nitrogen oxides
        and
        mercury emissions reduction) through 2011 reflects a total cost of approximately
        $1.5 billion. PPL expects a 30 MW reduction in generation capability at each
        of
        the Brunner Island and Montour plants, due to the estimated increases in
        station
        service usage during the scrubber operation.

Also
        citing its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has finalized Clean
        Air
        Mercury Regulations (CAMR) that affect coal-fired plants. These regulations
        establish a cap-and-trade program to take effect in two phases, with a first
        phase to begin in January 2010, and a second phase with more stringent caps
        to
        begin in January 2018. Under CAMR, each state is allocated a mercury emissions
        cap and is required to develop state implementing regulations that can follow
        the federal requirements or be more restrictive. Several states, including
        Pennsylvania, have challenged CAMR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
        of Columbia Circuit as not being sufficiently strict. PPL cannot predict
        the
        outcome and impact of that challenge.

Pennsylvania
        is proceeding with adoption of its own, more stringent mercury rules.
        Pennsylvania's rules will require that mercury controls be installed on each
        coal-fired generating unit; that the EPA's CAMR caps be met at each unit
        without
        the benefit of an emissions trading program; and that the second phase of
        CAMR
        be accelerated to begin in 2015.

PPL
        expects that it can achieve the 2010 requirements under Pennsylvania's more
        stringent mercury rules with only the addition of chemical injection systems.
        This expectation is based on the co-benefits of mercury removal from the
        scrubbers expected to be in place at its Pennsylvania plants as of 2010,
        and the
        SCRs already in place at Montour. PPL currently estimates that the capital
        cost
        of such chemical injection systems at its Pennsylvania plants will be
        approximately $20 million.

Because
        an emissions trading program is not allowed under Pennsylvania's mercury
        rules,
        adsorption/absorption technology with fabric filters may be required at most
        of
        PPL's Pennsylvania coal-fired generating units to meet Pennsylvania's
        second-phase caps beginning in 2015. Based on current analysis and industry
        estimates, PPL estimates that if this technology were required at every one
        of
        its Pennsylvania units the aggregate capital cost of compliance would be
        approximately $530 million.

Montana
        also has finalized its own more stringent rules that would require every
        coal-fired generating plant in the state to achieve by 2010 reduction levels
        more stringent than CAMR's 2018 cap. Because enhanced chemical injection
        technologies may not be sufficiently developed to meet this level of reductions
        by 2010, there is a risk that adsorption/absorption technology with fabric
        filters at both Colstrip and Corette would be required. Based on current
        analysis and industry estimates, PPL estimates that its capital cost to achieve
        compliance at its Montana units would be approximately $140 million.

PPL
        expects both Pennsylvania's and Montana's mercury rules to be challenged
        in
        court. If those rules are overturned and PPL is instead required to comply
        with
        CAMR, PPL expects that it could achieve the 2010 requirements under CAMR
        in both
        Pennsylvania and Montana with only the addition of chemical injection systems
        and allowance purchases. In addition to the capital cost for the chemical
        injection systems in Pennsylvania noted above, PPL estimates that its share
        of
        the capital cost for such systems in Montana would be approximately $5 million.
        With respect to the 2018 requirements under CAMR, PPL currently expects that
        it
        would be able to comply in Pennsylvania by installing adsorption/absorption
        technology with fabric filters on half of its generating capacity at a capital
        cost of approximately $265 million. In Montana, PPL currently expects that
        it
        could achieve the 2018 CAMR requirements with enhanced chemical injection
        at
        modest cost.

In
        addition to the above rules, the Clean Air Visibility Rule was issued by
        the EPA
        on June 15, 2005, to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility
        caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available
        Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including
        presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides controls for large
        units. In 2007, PPL must submit to the Pennsylvania DEP and to the Montana
        DEQ
        its analyses of the visibility impacts of plants covered by the BART rule
        in
        each state. In Pennsylvania, this would include Martins Creek Units 3 and
        4,
        Brunner Island Units 2 and 3 and Montour Units 1 and 2. In Montana, this
        would
        include Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and Corette.

The
        EPA
        has stated that the BART rule will not require states to make reductions
        in
        sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides beyond those required by CAIR, although
        states
        can establish more stringent rules. At this time, PPL cannot predict whether
        the
        Pennsylvania DEP will require additional reductions beyond the requirements
        established through CAIR. If the Pennsylvania DEP establishes regulations
        to
        require additional reductions, the additional costs to comply with such
        regulations, which are not now determinable, could be significant. In states
        like Montana that are not within the CAIR region, the need for and cost of
        additional controls as a result of this new rule are not now determinable,
        but
        could be significant.

In
        1999,
        the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several utilities, asserting
        that
        older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have, over the
        years,
        been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent "New Source"
        requirements under the Clean Air Act. The EPA subsequently issued notices
        of
        violation and commenced enforcement activities against other utilities. However,
        in the past several years, the EPA has shifted its position on New Source
        Review. In 2003, the EPA issued changes to its regulations that clarified
        what
        projects are exempt from "New Source" requirements as routine maintenance
        and
        repair. However, these regulations were stayed and subsequently struck down
        by
        the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. PPL is therefore
        continuing to operate under the "New Source" regulations as they existed
        prior
        to the EPA's 2003 clarifications.

In
        October 2005, the EPA proposed changing its rules on how to determine whether
        a
        project results in an emissions increase and is therefore subject to review
        under the "New Source" regulations. The EPA's proposed tests are consistent
        with
        the position of energy companies and industry groups and, if adopted, would
        substantially reduce the uncertainties under the current regulations. PPL
        cannot
        predict whether these proposed new tests will be adopted. In addition to
        proposing these new tests, the EPA also announced in October 2005 that it
        will
        not bring new enforcement actions with respect to projects that would satisfy
        the proposed new tests or the EPA's 2003 clarifications referenced above.
        Accordingly, PPL believes that it is unlikely that the EPA will follow up
        on the
        information requests that had been issued to PPL Montana's Corette and Colstrip
        plants by EPA Region VIII in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and to PPL
        Generation's Martins Creek plant by EPA Region III in 2002. However, states
        and
        environmental groups also have been bringing enforcement actions alleging
        violations of "New Source" requirements by coal-fired plants, and PPL is
        unable
        to predict whether such state or citizens enforcement actions will be brought
        with respect to any of its affiliates' plants.

The
        New
        Jersey DEP and some New Jersey residents raised environmental concerns with
        respect to the Martins Creek plant, particularly with respect to sulfur dioxide
        emissions and the opacity of the plant's plume. These issues were raised
        in the
        context of an appeal by the New Jersey DEP of the Air Quality Plan Approval
        issued by the Pennsylvania DEP to PPL's Lower Mt. Bethel generating plant.
        In
        October 2003, PPL finalized an agreement with the New Jersey DEP and the
        Pennsylvania DEP pursuant to which PPL will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
        from
        its Martins Creek power plant. Under the agreement, PPL Martins Creek will
        shut
        down the plant's two 150 MW coal-fired generating units in September 2007
        and may repower them any time after shutting them down so long as it follows
        all
        applicable state and federal requirements, including installing the best
        available pollution control technology. As a result of the agreement, the
        New
        Jersey DEP withdrew its challenge to the Air Quality Plan Approval for the
        Lower
        Mt. Bethel facility. The agreement will not result in material costs to PPL.
        The
        agreement does not address the issues raised by the New Jersey DEP regarding
        the
        visible opacity of emissions from the oil-fired units at the Martins Creek
        plant. Similar issues also are being raised by the Pennsylvania DEP. PPL
        is
        currently negotiating the matter with the Pennsylvania DEP. If it is determined
        that actions must be taken to address the visible opacity of these emissions,
        such actions could result in costs that are not now determinable, but could
        be
        significant.

In
        December 2003, PPL Montana, as operator of the Colstrip facility, received
        an
        Administrative Compliance Order (ACO) from the EPA pursuant to the Clean
        Air
        Act. The ACO alleges that Units 3 and 4 of the facility have been in violation
        of the Clean Air Act permit at Colstrip since 1980. The permit required Colstrip
        to submit for review and approval by the EPA an analysis and proposal for
        reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides to address visibility concerns upon
        the
        occurrence of certain triggering events. The EPA asserted that regulations
        it
        promulgated in 1980 triggered this requirement. PPL believes that the ACO
        is
        unfounded. PPL has been engaged in settlement negotiations on these matters
        with
        the EPA and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. In late 2006, PPL and the other
        Colstrip owners as well as the Northern Cheyenne Tribe executed a settlement
        agreement that is now awaiting signature by the EPA. Following execution
        by all
        parties, the agreement is expected to be entered by the court and the EPA's
        action would then be discontinued. The agreement calls for installation of
        low
        nitrogen oxides emissions equipment on Colstrip Units 3 and 4, payment of
        a
        non-material penalty and financing of an energy efficient project. PPL Montana's
        cost of this settlement is anticipated to be approximately $4
        million.

In
        addition to the requirements related to emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
        oxides and mercury noted above, there is a growing concern nationally and
        internationally about carbon dioxide emissions. In June 2005, the U.S. Senate
        adopted a resolution declaring that mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide
        are
        needed. Various legislative proposals are being considered in Congress, and
        several states already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions.
        The Bush administration is promoting a voluntary carbon dioxide reduction
        program, called the Climate VISION program. In support of this program, the
        electric power industry has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emission
        intensity levels (measured as tons of carbon dioxide equivalent against electric
        power production in MWh) by 3% to 5% by the 2010 to 2012 period. Separate
        from
        the national initiatives, in December 2005, seven northeastern states signed
        an
        MOU establishing a cap and trade program commencing in January 2009 for
        stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions, at base levels established in
        2005,
        from electric power plants larger than 25 MW in capacity. The MOU also provides
        for a 10% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the base levels by the
        end
        of 2018. In August 2006, a Model Rule was developed by these seven states
        that
        will form the basis for participants to adopt individual state laws and
        regulations for program implementation. Increased pressure for carbon dioxide
        emissions reduction also is coming from investor organizations and the
        international community.

Pennsylvania
        and Montana have not, at this time, established any formal programs to address
        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. However, the governor of each
        state
        has declared support for state action on these issues. PPL has conducted
        an
        inventory of its carbon dioxide emissions and is continuing to evaluate various
        options for reducing, avoiding, off-setting or sequestering its carbon dioxide
        emissions. If Pennsylvania or Montana develops legislation or regulations
        imposing mandatory reductions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
        on
        generation facilities, the cost to PPL of such reductions could be
        significant.

Water/Waste

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

In
        August
        2005, there was a release of approximately 100 million gallons of water
        containing fly ash from a disposal basin at the Martins Creek plant used
        in
        connection with the operation of the two 150 MW coal-fired generating units
        at the plant. This resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent roadways
        and
        fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware River. The leak was stopped,
        and PPL has determined that the problem was caused by a failure in the disposal
        basin's discharge structure. PPL has conducted extensive clean-up and is
        continuing to work with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies
        and
        consultants to assess whether the leak caused any environmental damage. PPL
        shut
        down the two units in September 2005 and placed the units back in service
        in
        December 2005 after completing the repairs and upgrades to the basin and
        obtaining the Pennsylvania DEP's approval.

The
        Pennsylvania DEP filed a complaint in Commonwealth Court against PPL Martins
        Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state laws and
        regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief. The Delaware Riverside
        Conservancy and several citizens have been granted the right, without objection
        from PPL, to intervene in the Pennsylvania DEP's action. PPL and the
        Pennsylvania DEP have reached a tentative settlement for the alleged violations.
        The proposed settlement requires PPL to pay $1.5 million in penalties and
        reimbursement of the DEP's costs, and requires PPL to undertake further studies
        of possible natural resource damages which PPL has been doing in conjunction
        with a group of natural resource trustees, along with the Delaware River
        Basin
        Commission. PPL expects the trustees and the Delaware River Basin Commission
        to
        seek to recover their costs and/or any damages they determine were caused
        by the
        leak. PPL has proposed a study plan under which the assessment will be completed
        and reported to the agencies by mid-2007. However, the agencies may require
        additional studies.

In
        March
        2006, several citizens (including some that have intervened in the Pennsylvania
        DEP's lawsuit) and two businesses filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of
        New
        Jersey, Warren County, alleging that the fly ash leak caused damage to property
        along a 40-mile stretch of the Delaware River and asserting that the named
        plaintiffs are representative of a class of citizens and businesses along
        the
        40-mile stretch of the Delaware River. PPL has exercised its right to move
        this
        lawsuit to federal court in New Jersey.

PPL
        Energy Supply recognized a $33 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter
        of
        2005 and an additional $15 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of
        (or a total of $31 million after tax, or $0.08 per share for PPL) in connection
        with the then-expected on-site and off-site costs relating to the Martins
        Creek
        leak remediation. Based on its ongoing assessment of the expected remediation
        costs, in 2006, PPL Energy Supply reduced the estimate in connection with
        the
        current expected costs of the leak by $11 million, of which $10 million related
        to off-site costs and the remainder to on-site costs. At December 31, 2006,
        management's best estimate of the probable loss associated with the Martins
        Creek ash basin leak was $37 million, of which $31 million relates to off-site
        costs, and the balance to on-site costs. At December 31, 2006, the remaining
        contingency for this remediation was $9 million. PPL and PPL Energy Supply
        cannot be certain of the outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania
        DEP, the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, the outcome of
        the
        lawsuit brought by the citizens and businesses and the exact nature of any
        other
        regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against PPL, PPL
        Energy
        Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin leak.

Seepages
        have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins at various PPL
        plants, including the Montour, Brunner Island and Martins Creek generating
        facilities. PPL has completed an assessment of some of the seepages at the
        Montour and Brunner Island facilities and is working with the Pennsylvania
        DEP
        to implement abatement measures for those seepages. PPL is continuing to
        conduct
        assessments of other seepages at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities
        as
        well as seepages at the Martins Creek facility to determine the appropriate
        abatement actions. PPL plans to comprehensively address issues related to
        wastewater basins at all of its Pennsylvania plants, as part of the process
        to
        renew the residual waste permits for these basins that expire within the
        next
        two years. PPL has a remaining contingency of $1 million to assess and/or
        abate
        seepage from certain facilities and has $5 million budgeted in the 2007 capital
        budget to upgrade and/or replace certain waste water facilities in response
        to
        the seepage and other facility changes. The potential cost to address other
        seepages or to replace existing wastewater basins at PPL's Pennsylvania plants
        is not now determinable, but could be significant.

PPL
        has
        reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania DEP concerning the thermal discharge
        from its Brunner Island plant into the Susquehanna River. The settlement
        commits
        PPL to install mechanical draft cooling towers at the plant. PPL expects
        construction of the cooling towers to begin by the end of 2007 and for the
        towers to be in service in the spring of 2010. The expected capital cost
        of the
        installation of the towers is $125 million.

The
        settlement with the Pennsylvania DEP regarding the Brunner Island discharge
        has
        been incorporated into a new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
        permit for the plant. PPL has filed an appeal to the permit on issues other
        than
        the settlement. PPL and the DEP have reached a tentative settlement of this
        appeal. The costs of the settlement are not material.

In
        May
        2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs brought an action now pending at the Montana
        Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County, against PPL Montana and
        the
        other owners of the Colstrip plant alleging property damage from seepage
        from
        the freshwater and wastewater ponds at Colstrip. PPL Montana has undertaken
        certain groundwater investigation and remediation measures at the Colstrip
        plant
        to address groundwater contamination alleged by the plaintiffs as well as
        other
        groundwater contamination at the plant. These measures include proceeding
        with
        extending city water to certain residents who live near the plant, some of
        whom
        are plaintiffs in the litigation. Beyond the original estimated reserve of
        $1
        million recorded by PPL Montana in 2004 (of which only an insignificant amount
        remains at December 31, 2006) for a proposed settlement of the property damage
        claims raised in the litigation, for extending city water and for a portion
        of
        the remedial investigation costs, PPL Montana may incur further costs based
        on
        its additional groundwater investigations and any related remedial measures,
        which costs are not now determinable, but could be significant.

The
        EPA
        has significantly tightened the water quality standard for arsenic. The revised
        standard became effective in January 2006 and at this time applies only to
        drinking water. The revised standard may result in action by individual states
        that could require several PPL subsidiaries to either further treat wastewater
        or take abatement action at their power plants, or both. The cost of complying
        with any such requirements is not now determinable, but could be
        significant.

The
        EPA
        finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake
        structures. These requirements affect where generating facilities are built,
        establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling
        towers at new and modified power plants. Another rule that was finalized
        in 2004
        addresses existing structures. Six northeastern states challenged the new
        rules
        for existing structures as being inadequate. In January 2007, the U.S. Court
        of
        Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded to the EPA all of the main requirements
        of the rule for further analysis and rulemaking. Depending on what changes
        the
        EPA makes to the rule in accordance with this decision, and/or what actions
        the
        states may take on their own, the impacts of the actions could result in
        stricter standards for existing structures that could impose significant
        costs
        on PPL subsidiaries.

Superfund
        and Other Remediation

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric is a potentially responsible party at several sites listed by the
        EPA
        under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant Site.
        Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites,
        the
        costs of which have not been significant. However, should the EPA require
        significantly different or additional measures in the future, the costs of
        such
        measures are not determinable but could be significant.

In
        1995,
        PPL Electric and PPL Generation and, in 1996, PPL Gas Utilities entered into
        consent orders with the Pennsylvania DEP to address a number of sites that
        were
        not being addressed under another regulatory program such as Superfund, but
        for
        which PPL Electric, PPL Generation or PPL Gas Utilities may be liable for
        remediation. These agreements have now been combined into a single agreement
        for
        the companies. The Consent Order and Agreement (COA) includes potential PCB
        contamination at certain PPL Electric substations and pole sites; potential
        contamination at a number of coal gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned
        or
        operated by PPL Electric; oil or other contamination that may exist at some
        of
        PPL Electric's former generating facilities; and potential contamination
        at
        abandoned power plant sites owned by PPL Generation. This also includes former
        coal gas manufacturing facilities and potential mercury contamination from
        gas
        meters and regulators at PPL Gas Utilities' sites.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities have 118 sites to address
        under the new combined COA, and currently no PPL Generation sites are included
        on the COA site list. Additional sites formerly owned or operated by PPL
        Electric, PPL Generation or PPL Gas Utilities are added to the COA on a
        case-by-case basis.

At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities had accrued $2 million
        and
        $5 million, respectively, representing the estimated amounts each will have
        to
        spend for site remediation, including those sites covered by the COA noted
        above. Depending on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations
        have not begun or have not been completed, the costs of remediation and other
        liabilities could be substantial. PPL and its subsidiaries also could incur
        other non-remediation costs at sites included in the consent orders or other
        contaminated sites, the costs of which are not now determinable, but could
        be
        significant.

There
        continues to be an issue with natural gas observed in several drinking water
        wells in and around Tioga County, Pennsylvania, that the Pennsylvania DEP
        has
        been working to address. The Pennsylvania DEP has raised concerns that potential
        leakage of natural gas from the Tioga gas storage field partially owned by
        PPL
        Gas Utilities could be contributing to this issue. PPL Gas Utilities continues
        to work with the Pennsylvania DEP and to discuss the matter with the co-owner
        and operator of the field. The costs to resolve this issue are not now
        determinable, but could be significant.

The
        EPA
        is evaluating the risks associated with naphthalene, a chemical by-product
        of
        coal gas manufacturing operations. As a result of the EPA's evaluation,
        individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and
        soil
        clean-up. This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive
        assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing facilities.
        The
        costs to PPL of complying with any such requirements are not now determinable,
        but could be significant.

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

Under
        the
        Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated
        to
        remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to
        take
        additional measures to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously
        capped
        refuse piles. One PPL Generation subsidiary is pumping mine water at two
        mine
        sites, and treating water at one of these sites. Another PPL Generation
        subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a third site.
        At
        December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply had accrued a discounted liability of
        $29
        million to cover the costs of pumping and treating groundwater at the two
        mine
        sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining passive wetlands treatment
        at the third site. PPL Energy Supply discounted this liability at a rate
        of
        5.82%. Expected undiscounted payments are estimated at $1 million for each
        of
        the years from 2007 through 2011, and the expected payments for the work
        after
        2011 are $116 million.

In
        1999,
        the Montana Supreme Court held in favor of several citizens' groups that
        the
        right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed
        by
        the Montana Constitution. Currently pending before the Court are three cases
        relating to the manner in which this fundamental right may be exercised and
        the
        proper measurement of damages for environmental impacts to property. These
        cases
        were consolidated for purposes of arguments before the Court. The Court's
        ruling
        on this consolidated litigation could result in significantly more lawsuits
        under Montana's environmental laws. The effect on PPL Montana of any such
        increase in legal actions is not currently determinable, but could be
        significant.

        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Future
        cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites
        not
        currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for
        PPL
        subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time.

Electric
        and Magnetic Fields

(PPL,
        PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Concerns
        have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
        effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
        electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
        substation equipment. Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K. have
        reviewed this issue.

The
        U.S.
        National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that,
        for
        most health outcomes, there is no evidence of EMFs causing adverse effects.
        The
        agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an
        association with childhood leukemia, but that this evidence is difficult
        to
        interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. The U.K. National Radiological
        Protection Board (now part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded
        in
        2004 that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that
        EMFs
        cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
        existing exposure guidelines.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether EMFs cause
        adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce EMFs,
        where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities.
        PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the EMF
        issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the U.S. or
        abroad, and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might
        incur
        related to the EMF issue.

        with respect to environmental matters. PPL believes that WPD has taken and
        continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and governmental
        regulations for the protection of the environment. There are no material
        legal
        or administrative proceedings pending against WPD with respect to environmental
        matters. See "Environmental Matters - Domestic - Electric and Magnetic
        Fields" for a discussion of EMFs.

        PPL
        believes that these affiliates have taken and continue to take measures to
        comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the protection
        of the environment. There are no material legal or administrative proceedings
        pending against PPL's affiliates in Latin America with respect to environmental
        matters.

Other

Nuclear
        Insurance

(PPL
        and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
        Susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage
        for
        property damage to members' nuclear generating stations. Facilities at the
        Susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses up to $2.75
        billion under these programs. PPL Susquehanna is also a member of an insurance
        program that provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power
        during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified
        conditions. Under the property and replacement power insurance programs,
        PPL
        Susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers'
        adverse loss experience. At

December 31

,
        2006,
        this maximum assessment was about $38 million.

In
        the
        event of a nuclear incident at the Susquehanna station,

PPL
        Susquehanna's public liability for claims resulting from such incident would
        be
        limited to about $10.8 billion under provisions of The Price-Anderson Act
        Amendments under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. PPL Susquehanna is protected
        against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry
        assessment program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors
        covered by The Price-Anderson Act Amendments under the Energy Policy Act
        of
        2005, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $201 million per incident,
        payable
        at $30 million per year.

Guarantees

In
        the
        normal course of business, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric enter
        into
        agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties
        on
        behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example,

guarantees,
        stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds
        issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily
        to
        support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a
        stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these
        subsidiaries enter.

to

PPL
                  Energy Supply's maximum exposure with respect to certain indemnifications
                  and the expiration of the indemnifications cannot be estimated
                  because, in
                  the case of certain of the indemnification provisions, the maximum
                  potential liability is not capped by the transaction documents
                  and the
                  expiration date is based on the applicable statute of limitations.
                  The
                  exposure noted is only for those cases in which the agreements
                  provide for
                  a specific limit on the amount of the indemnification.

In
                  connection with the liquidation of wholly owned subsidiaries that
                  have
                  been deconsolidated upon turning the entities over to the liquidators,
                  certain affiliates of PPL Global have agreed to indemnify the liquidators,
                  directors and/or the entities themselves for any liabilities or
                  expenses
                  arising during the liquidation process, including liabilities and
                  expenses
                  of the entities placed into liquidation. In some cases, the
                  indemnifications are limited to a maximum amount that is based
                  on
                  distributions made from the subsidiary to its parent either prior
                  or
                  subsequent to being placed into liquidation. In other cases, the
                  maximum
                  amount of the indemnifications is not explicitly stated in the
                  agreements.
                  The indemnifications generally expire two to seven years subsequent
                  to the
                  date of dissolution of the entities. The exposure noted only includes
                  those cases in which the agreements provide for a specific limit
                  on the
                  amount of the indemnification, and the expiration date was based
                  on an
                  estimate of the dissolution date of the entities.

Certain
                  of the indemnifications provided to the purchaser of the Sundance
                  plant
                  are triggered only if the purchaser's losses reach $1 million in
                  the
                  aggregate, are capped at 50% of the purchase price (or $95 million),
                  and
                  survive for a period of only 24 months after the May 13, 2005,
                  transaction
                  closing. The indemnification provision for unknown environmental
                  and tort
                  liabilities related to periods prior to the ownership by PPL Sundance
                  Energy, LLC of the real property on which the Sundance plant is
                  located
                  are capped at $4 million in the aggregate and survive for a maximum
                  period
                  of five years after the transaction closing.

Certain
                  of the indemnifications provided to the purchaser of the interest
                  of PPL
                  Southwest Generation Holdings, LLC in the Griffith plant are triggered
                  only if the purchaser's losses reach $750,000 in the aggregate,
                  are capped
                  at 35% of the purchase price (or $41 million), and survive for
                  a period of
                  only 18 months after the June 30, 2006, transaction closing. In
                  the case
                  of most such indemnification obligations, the purchaser's existing
                  50%
                  ownership of the Griffith plant prior to closing is taken into
                  account for
                  purposes of determining and calculating the purchaser's losses,
                  and such
                  indemnification obligations are therefore limited to 50% of any
                  such
                  purchaser losses.

PPL
                  Energy Supply had also guaranteed the obligation of PPL Southwest
                  Generation Holdings, LLC to (i) indemnify the purchaser of its
                  interest in
                  the Griffith plant for one-half of the total cost of repairing
                  a damaged
                  steam turbine at the plant, and (ii) pay the purchaser a variable
                  amount
                  until completion of repair of the turbine. In December 2006, PPL

                  Generation Holdings, LLC and the purchaser entered into a settlement
                  and
                  release agreement relating to the steam turbine repair indemnification
                  and
                  payment obligations. As a result of this agreement, PPL Energy
                  Supply has
                  no further indemnification obligations relating to these matters.

Assignment
                  of Enron claims


In
                  July 2006, two subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply assigned their
                  Enron
                  claims to an independent third party (claims purchaser). In connection
                  with the assignment, the subsidiaries agreed to repay a pro rata
                  share of
                  the purchase price paid by the claims purchaser, plus interest,
                  in the
                  event that any of the assigned claims are disallowed under certain
                  circumstances. The bankruptcy court overseeing the Enron bankruptcy
                  approved the assigned claims prior to their assignment to the claims
                  purchaser. The subsidiaries' repayment obligations will remain
                  in effect
                  until the claims purchaser has received all distributions with
                  respect to
                  the assigned claims. See Note 1 for additional information regarding
                  the
                  assignment of the claims.

WPD
                  guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated
                  entities





As
                  a result of the privatization of the utility industry in the U.K.,
                  certain
                  electric associations' roles and responsibilities were discontinued
                  or
                  modified. As a result, certain obligations, primarily pension-related,
                  associated with these organizations have been guaranteed by the
                  participating members. Costs are allocated to the members based
                  on
                  predetermined percentages as outlined in specific agreements. However,
                  if
                  a member becomes insolvent, costs can be reallocated to and are
                  guaranteed
                  by the remaining members. At December 31, 2006, WPD has recorded
                  an
                  estimated discounted liability based on its current allocated percentage
                  of the total expected costs. Neither the expiration date nor the
                  maximum
                  amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly
                  stated
                  in the related agreements. Therefore, they have been estimated based on
                  the types of obligations.

Tax
                  indemnification related to unconsolidated WPD affiliates



Two
                  WPD unconsolidated affiliates were refinanced during 2005. Under
                  the terms
                  of the refinancing, WPD has indemnified the lender against certain
                  tax and
                  other liabilities. At this time, WPD believes that the likelihood
                  of such
                  liabilities arising is remote.

Guarantee
                  of a portion of an unconsolidated entity's debt



The
                  exposure at December 31, 2006, reflects principal payments
                  only.

(a)

Represents
                  the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that
                  could be
                  required to be made under the guarantee.

(b)

Other
                  than the letters of credit, all guarantees of PPL Energy Supply
                  and PPL
                  Electric also apply to PPL on a consolidated
                  basis.

In
        September 2006, PPL's subsidiaries terminated master lease agreements under
        which they leased equipment. Therefore, the related residual value guarantees
        that had been previously disclosed for PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
        no longer exist. See Note 11 for additional information.

PPL,
        PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries provide other
        miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course
        of
        business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of various indemnifications
        or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The
        obligated amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and
        the
        overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be
        reasonably estimated. Historically, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
        and
        their subsidiaries have not made any significant payments with respect to
        these
        types of guarantees. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate fair value of
        these
        indemnifications related to arrangements entered into subsequent to December
        31,
        2002, was insignificant. Among these guarantees are:

PPL,
        on
        behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that
        covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage.
        The coverage requires a $4 million deductible per occurrence and provides
        maximum aggregate coverage of $175 million. This insurance may be applicable
        to
        certain obligations under the contractual arrangements discussed
        above.

At
        both
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets
        reflect
        $89 million of "Long-term Debt with Affiliate Trust." This debt represents
        obligations of WPD LLP under 8.23% subordinated debentures maturing in February
        2027 that are held by SIUK Capital Trust I, a variable interest entity whose
        common securities are owned by WPD LLP but which is not consolidated by WPD
        LLP.
        Interest expense on this obligation was $11 million, $12 million and $11
        million
        in 2006, 2005 and 2004. This interest is reflected in "Interest Expense"
        for PPL
        and "Interest Expense with Affiliates" for PPL Energy Supply on the Statements
        of Income. See Note 8 for a discussion of the redemption of the subordinated

PLR
        Contracts

(PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric has power sales agreements with PPL EnergyPlus, effective July 2000
        and
        January 2002, to supply all of PPL Electric's PLR load through December 31,
        2009. Under these contracts, PPL EnergyPlus provides electricity at the
        predetermined capped prices that PPL Electric is authorized to charge its
        PLR
        customers. These purchases totaled $1.7 billion in 2006, $1.6 billion in
        and $1.5 billion in 2004. These purchases include nuclear decommissioning
        recovery and amortization of an up-front contract payment and are included
        in
        the Statements of Income as "Wholesale energy marketing to affiliate" by
        PPL
        Energy Supply, and as "Energy purchases from affiliate" by PPL
        Electric.

Under
        one
        of the PLR contracts, PPL Electric is required to make performance assurance
        deposits with PPL EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less
        than
        the contract price by more than its contract collateral threshold. Conversely,
        PPL EnergyPlus is required to make performance assurance deposits with PPL
        Electric when the market price of electricity is greater than the contract
        price
        by more than its contract collateral threshold. PPL Electric estimated that
        at
        December 31, 2006, the market price of electricity would exceed the contract
        price by approximately $2.2 billion. Accordingly, at December 31, 2006, PPL
        Energy Supply was required to provide PPL Electric with performance assurance
        of
        $300 million, the maximum amount required under the contract. PPL Energy
        Supply's deposit with PPL Electric was $300 million at both December 31,
        and 2005. This deposit is shown on the Balance Sheets as "Collateral on PLR
        energy supply to/from affiliate," a current asset of PPL Energy Supply and
        a
        current liability of PPL Electric. PPL Electric pays interest equal to the
        one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% on this deposit, which is included in "Interest
        Expense with Affiliate" on the Statements of Income. PPL Energy Supply records
        this as affiliated interest income, which is included in "Other Income -
        net" on
        the Statements of Income.

In
        2001,
        PPL Electric made a $90 million up-front payment to PPL EnergyPlus in connection
        with the PLR contracts. The up-front payment is being amortized by both parties
        over the term of the PLR contracts. The unamortized balance of this payment
        and
        other payments under the contract was $35 million at December 31, 2006, and
        $47
        million at December 31, 2005. These current and noncurrent balances are
        reported on the Balance Sheets as "Deferred revenue on PLR energy supply
        to
        affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Prepayment on PLR energy supply
        from
        affiliate" by PPL Electric.

NUG
        Purchases

(PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Electric has a reciprocal contract with PPL EnergyPlus to sell electricity
        purchased under contracts with NUGs. PPL Electric purchases electricity from
        the
        NUGs at contractual rates and then sells the electricity at the same price
        to
        PPL EnergyPlus. These purchases totaled $157 million in 2006, $148 million
        in
        2005 and $154 million in 2004. These amounts are included in the Statements
        of
        Income as "Energy purchases from affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as
        "Wholesale electric to affiliate" by PPL Electric.

Allocations
        of Corporate Service Costs

(PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources
        and information services. PPL Services bills the respective PPL subsidiaries
        for
        the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. The cost
        of
        these services that is not directly charged to PPL subsidiaries is allocated
        to
        certain of the subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative
        invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses, and number of employees.
        PPL Services directly charged or allocated the following amounts, which PPL
        management believes are reasonable, to PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric,
        including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between
        capital and expense.

Intercompany
        Borrowings

(PPL
        Energy Supply)

PPL
        Energy Supply had no notes receivable from affiliates at December 31, 2006
        and
        2005. Interest earned on cash collateral and loans to affiliates, included
        in
        "Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income, was $21 million, $15 million
        and $6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

In
        May
        2006, PPL Energy Supply terminated a note payable to an affiliate which allowed
        borrowings up to $650 million until May 2010. At December 31, 2005, there
        was no
        balance outstanding. Interest was payable monthly in arrears at LIBOR plus
        1%.
        There was an insignificant amount of interest expense on this note in 2006.
        Such
        interest expense totaled $9 million and $8 million in 2005 and 2004. Interest
        expense is reflected in "Interest Expense with Affiliates" on the Statements
        of
        Income.

In
        December 2005, PPL Energy Supply issued a $30 million demand note payable
        to an
        affiliate. In June 2006, this demand note payable was terminated. At December
        31, 2005, there was a balance of $8 million, which is shown on the Balance
        Sheets as "Note Payable to Affiliate," a current liability. Interest was
        payable
        monthly at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.5%. Interest on this note was
        insignificant for both 2006 and 2005.

(

PPL
        Electric)

In
        August
        2004, a PPL Electric subsidiary issued a $300 million demand note to an
        affiliate. In February 2006, the demand note was amended to increase the
        maximum
        amount of the note to $450 million. In April 2006, the note was amended back
        to
        a maximum amount of $300 million. There was a balance of $300 million
        outstanding at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. Interest is due quarterly
        at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25%. This note is shown on the
        Balance Sheets as "Note receivable from affiliate." Interest earned on the
        note
        is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income, and was
        $20
        million, $14 million and $3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

In
        May
        2006, a PPL Electric subsidiary issued a $150 million demand note to an
        affiliate. There was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2006. Interest
        is
        due monthly at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 1.25%.

        Royalties

(PPL
        Energy Supply)

A
        PPL
        subsidiary owns PPL trademarks and bills certain affiliates for their use.
        PPL
        Energy Supply was allocated $36 million of this license fee in 2006, $31
        million
        in 2005 and $34 million in 2004. These allocations are primarily included
        in
        "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

Transmission

(PPL
        Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
        Energy Supply owns no domestic transmission or distribution facilities, other
        than facilities to interconnect its generation with the electric transmission
        system. Therefore, PPL EnergyPlus and other PPL Generation subsidiaries must
        pay
        PJM, the operator of the transmission system, to deliver the energy these
        subsidiaries supply to retail and wholesale customers in PPL Electric's
        franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania. PJM in turn pays
        PPL
        Electric for the use of its transmission system. PPL eliminates the impact
        of
        these revenues and expenses on its consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Management
      of Market Risk Exposures

Market
      risk is the potential loss PPL and PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result
      of
      price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument.
      PPL and PPL Energy Supply are exposed to market risk from:

PPL
      has a
      risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market
      risk
      and counterparty credit risk. The RMC, comprised of senior management and
      chaired by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
      function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the
      risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review
      and approval, validation of transactions and market prices, verification of
      risk
      and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, and daily portfolio reporting,
      including open positions, mark-to-market valuations, and other risk measurement
      metrics.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
      and structured deals such as tolling agreements as part of its risk management
      strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
      price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility. All derivatives are
      recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet SFAS
      criteria for exclusion (see discussion in "Accounting Designations"
      below).

Fair
      Value Hedges

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into financial or physical contracts to hedge a portion
      of the fair value of firm commitments of forward electricity sales and emission
      allowance positions. These contracts range in maturity through 2007.
      Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial contracts to hedge
      fluctuations in the market value of existing debt issuances. These contracts
      range in maturity through 2046. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into
      foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exchange rates associated with
      firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts
      range in maturity through

2008.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply did not recognize significant gains or losses resulting from
      hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for
      2006, 2005 or 2004. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also did not recognize any gains
      or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges for these
      years.

Cash
      Flow Hedges

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical contracts, including
      forwards, futures and swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated
      with
      electric, gas, oil and other commodities. These contracts range in maturity
      through 2012. Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial
      interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both
      existing and anticipated debt issuances. These interest rate swap contracts
      range in maturity through 2017 for PPL and PPL Energy Supply. PPL and PPL Energy
      Supply also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the cash
      flows associated with foreign currency-denominated debt, the exchange rates
      associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and the
      net
      investment of foreign operations. These forward contracts range in maturity
      through 2028.

Net
      investment hedge activity is reported in the foreign currency translation
      adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss). PPL recorded net
      investment hedge losses, after tax, of $6 million as of December 31, 2006
      and 2005, and $7 million as of December 31, 2004.

Cash
      flow
      hedges may be discontinued if it is probable that the original forecasted
      transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period.
      Due to the sale of PPL's 50% interest in the Griffith plant in the second
      quarter of 2006 and the conversion of a portion of PPL Energy Supply's 2.625%
      Convertible Senior Notes, PPL and PPL Energy Supply reclassified net gains
      of $5
      million, after tax, from accumulated other comprehensive loss. There were no
      such events in 2005, and there was an insignificant impact from such an event
      in
      2004.

At
      the
      end of 2006, 2005 and 2004, hedging ineffectiveness associated with energy
      derivatives was, after tax, a gain of $8 million, a loss of $3 million and
      insignificant.

Ineffectiveness
      associated with interest rate and foreign currency derivatives was not
      significant for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, the deferred net loss, after tax, on derivative instruments
      in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" expected to be reclassified into
      earnings during the next twelve months is a loss of $8 million for PPL and
      a
      loss of $4 million for PPL Energy Supply. Amounts are reclassified as the energy
      contracts go to delivery and as interest payments are made.

This
      table shows the accumulated net unrealized losses on qualifying derivatives
      (excluding net investment hedges), after tax, which are included in accumulated
      other comprehensive loss.

Other
      Hedging Activity

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply have entered into energy derivative transactions that hedge
      a
      specific risk, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. The
      unrealized gains and losses on these transactions are considered non-trading
      activities and are reflected on the Statements of Income in "Wholesale energy
      marketing" or "Energy-related businesses" revenues, or "Fuel" or "Energy
      purchases" expenses.

Accounting
      Designations

For
      energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the circumstances
      and
      intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine
      their accounting designation, which is subsequently verified by an independent
      internal group on a daily basis. The following summarizes the electricity
      guidelines that have been provided to the marketers who are responsible for
      contract designation for derivative energy contracts in accordance with SFAS
      133.

Any
      unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment
      to the extent they are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive
      income. These unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts
      settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions
      occur.

In
      addition to energy-related transactions, PPL enters into financial interest
      rate
      and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest rate and foreign currency
      risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL and
      PPL
      Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the
      fair
      value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments
      in
      foreign operations. As with energy transactions, the circumstances and intent
      existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract's accounting
      designation, which is subsequently verified by an independent internal group
      on
      a daily basis. The following is a summary of certain guidelines that have been
      provided to PPL's Finance Department, which is responsible for contract
      designation.

Credit
      Concentration

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into contracts with many entities for the purchase
      and
      sale of energy. Many of these contracts are considered a normal part of doing
      business and, as such, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is not
      reflected in the financial statements. However, the fair value of these
      contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit
      perspective.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply have credit exposures to energy trading partners. The majority
      of these exposures is the fair value of multi-year contracts for energy sales
      and purchases. Therefore, if these counterparties fail to perform their
      obligations under such contracts, PPL and PPL Energy Supply would not experience
      an immediate financial loss but would experience lower revenues or higher costs
      in future years to the extent that replacement sales or purchases could not
      be
      made at the same prices as those under the defaulted contracts.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply generally have the right to request collateral from their
      counterparties in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below
      investment grade. It is also the policy of PPL and PPL Energy Supply to enter
      into netting agreements with all of their counterparties to limit credit
      exposure.

At
      December 31, 2006, both PPL and PPL Energy Supply had credit exposures of $528
      million to energy trading partners, excluding the effects of netting
      arrangements. Ten counterparties accounted for 72% of this exposure. No other
      individual counterparty accounted for more than 3% of the exposure. All ten
      of
      these counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from S&P. This
      credit exposure has been reduced to $48 million as a result of netting
      arrangements.

(PPL
      Electric)

PPL
      Electric has an exposure to PPL Energy Supply under the long-term contract
      for
      PPL EnergyPlus to supply PPL Electric's PLR load, as described in Note 16.
      This
      is the only credit exposure for PPL Electric that has a mark-to-market element.
      No other counterparty accounts for more than 1% of PPL Electric's total
      exposure.

      foreign currency exchange rates, offset by $16 million of adjustments pursuant
      to EITF Issue 93-7, "Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase
      Business Combination." See Note 5 for a discussion of a $12 million adjustment
      to decrease goodwill related to the transfer of WPD tax items. The adjustments
      also include a $9 million net increase based upon actions taken by Inland
      Revenue, a U.K. government agency, and an $8 million decrease associated with
      monetary indexation of assets at WPD.

In

Asset
      Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Based
      on
      the requirements of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,"

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply identified various legal obligations to retire long-lived
      assets, the largest of which relates to the decommissioning of the Susquehanna
      plant. PPL and PPL Energy Supply identified and recorded other AROs related
      to
      significant interim retirements at the Susquehanna plant, and various
      environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin
      retirements at Susquehanna and other facilities.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
      Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," effective December
      31, 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability
      for the fair value of a conditional ARO when incurred if the fair value of
      the
      ARO can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would
      have
      sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. The
      adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an increase in net PP&E of $4 million,
      recognition of AROs of $17 million, recognition of deferred tax assets of $5
      million and a cumulative effect of adoption that decreased net income by $8
      million (net of tax benefit of $6 million), or $0.02 per share for
      PPL.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply identified several conditional AROs. The most significant
      of
      these related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing material at
      various generation plants. The fair value of the portion of these obligations
      that could be reasonably estimated was recorded at December 31, 2005, and
      resulted in AROs of $14 million and a cumulative effect of adoption that
      decreased net income by $8 million.

PPL
      Global identified and recorded conditional AROs that related to treated wood
      poles and fluid-filled cables, which had an insignificant impact on the
      financial statements.

In
      addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but were
      unable to reasonably estimate their fair values. These retirement obligations
      could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. The
      generation plants, where significant amounts of asbestos-containing material
      are
      located, have been well maintained and large capital and environmental
      investments are being made at these plants. During the previous five years,
      the
      useful lives of the plants had been reviewed and in most cases significantly
      extended. See Note 1 for further discussion related to the extension of the
      useful lives of these assets. Due to these circumstances, PPL management was
      unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates
      for
      the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at the generation
      plants. If economic events or other circumstances change that enable PPL and
      PPL
      Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement
      obligations, they will be recorded at that time.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations that could not
      be
      reasonably estimated at that time. These items included requirements associated
      with the retirement of a reservoir and certain transmission assets. These
      retirement obligations could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable
      settlement dates.

The
      changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were:

Changes
      in ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various
      AROs, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are
      incorporated into the latest estimate of the obligations. PPL and PPL Energy
      Supply changed estimated settlement dates on several AROs, the most significant
      being the ash basins at the Brunner Island and Montour plants. In addition,
      revised estimates of asbestos-containing material that is expected to be
      remediated in future years were obtained. The effect of these changes was to
      increase the ARO liability and related plant balances by $18 million. The 2006
      income statement impact of these changes was insignificant.

The
      pro
      forma income statement effects, including the effects on income from continuing
      operations, net income, and basic and diluted EPS, from the application of
      FIN
      47 calculated as if it had been adopted prior to January 1, 2004, also would
      have been insignificant for 2004 and 2005.

(PPL
      Electric)

PPL
      Electric adopted FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005. PPL Electric did not record
      any AROs upon adoption of this standard. PPL Electric identified legal
      retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that
      could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These
      assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL
      Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the
      discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to
      determine when these events may occur.

        expected cost to decommission the Susquehanna plant is based on a 2002
        site-specific study that estimated the cost to dismantle and decommission
        each
        unit immediately following final shutdown. PPL Susquehanna's 90% share of
        the
        total estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna plant was approximately
        $936 million measured in 2002 dollars. This estimate includes decommissioning
        the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal of
        non-radiological structures and materials.

Beginning
        in January 1999, in accordance with the PUC Final Order, approximately $130
        million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from PPL Electric's
        customers through the CTC over the 11-year life of the CTC rather than the
        remaining life of Susquehanna. The recovery includes a return on unamortized
        decommissioning costs. Under the power supply agreements between PPL Electric
        and PPL EnergyPlus, these revenues are passed on to PPL EnergyPlus. Similarly,
        these revenues are passed on to PPL Susquehanna under a power supply agreement
        between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Susquehanna.

Accrued
        nuclear decommissioning expenses, as determined under the provisions of SFAS
        143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," are $276 million and
        $255
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and are included in "Asset
        retirement obligations" on the Balance Sheets. Accretion expense, as determined
        under the provisions of SFAS 143, was $21 million in 2006, $19 million in
        and $18 million in 2004, and is included in "Other operation and maintenance"
        on
        the Statements of Income.

Amounts
        collected from PPL Electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable
        taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only
        be used
        for future decommissioning costs. To the extent that the actual costs for
        decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds,
        PPL Susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the shortfall.

In
        accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
        Securities,” securities held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are
        classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried
        on
        the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on
        available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive
        income or are recognized currently in earnings when a decline in fair value
        is
        determined to be other than temporary.

Prior
        to
        2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply assessed a security’s impairment by, among other
        things, considering the cause of the security’s decline in value, the length of
        time and the magnitude of the security’s decline in value, and its expected
        period of recovery. As a result of this assessment, a security experiencing
        a
        decline in value was usually deemed temporarily impaired because the decline
        in
        value was generally not considered significant.

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of
        Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP
        115-1), which was effective for PPL and PPL Energy Supply beginning January
        1,
        2006. Among other things, FSP 115-1 indicated that existing guidance,
        particularly SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, “Other Than Temporary
        Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SAB Topic 5M),
        should be used to determine if a decline in a security’s value is other than
        temporary. Recent clarification related to applying the guidance in SAB Topic
        5M
        has established the ability to hold an investment until it recovers its value
        as
        a required element in determining if an individual security is other than
        temporarily impaired. Based on this clarification and as a result of NRC
        requirements that nuclear decommissioning trusts be managed by independent
        investment managers, with discretion to buy and sell securities in the trusts,
        PPL Susquehanna has concluded that during 2006 it was unable to demonstrate
        the
        ability to hold an impaired security until it recovers its value. Accordingly,
        for 2006 unrealized losses represented other than temporary impairments,
        which
        required a current period charge to earnings. Unrealized gains continued
        to be
        recorded to other comprehensive income.

In
        the
        fourth quarter of 2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $6
        million ($3 million after tax, or $0.01 per share for PPL) to reflect the
        cumulative impact for 2006 of the other-than-temporary impairment of affected
        securities. The impairment charge is reflected in "Other Income-net" on PPL's
        and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Income. The adjustment was recorded
        in the
        fourth quarter of 2006, as the adjustment was not material to the financial
        statements for the first three quarters of 2006, or as recorded in the fourth
        quarter of 2006. The adoption of this change in accounting in periods prior
        to
        2006 would also not have been material to previously issued financial
        statements.

The
        following tables show the gross unrealized gains and losses recorded in OCI
        and
        the related fair values for the securities held in the nuclear decommissioning
        trust funds.

At
        December 31, 2005, PPL Susquehanna's nuclear decommissioning trust funds
        contained investments with an aggregate unrealized loss position of $4 million,
        of which $2 million was attributable to investments with an aggregate fair
        value
        of $69 million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for
        less
        than 12 months, and $2 million was attributable to investments with an aggregate
        fair value of $40 million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position
        for 12 months or longer. The equity securities' unrealized loss position
        consists of 132 investments with an aggregate fair value of $20 million and
        an
        average unrealized loss of 7%. The largest unrealized loss for any individual
        investment was $387 thousand, which represents a decrease in value of 15%.
        The
        minor decline in the value of government securities was primarily due to
        the
        impact of interest rates, as such securities are essentially free of credit
        risk. At December 31, 2005, PPL Susquehanna believed it was reasonable to
        expect
        these securities to recover from this temporary decline in value.

Of
        the
        $164 million of government obligations and other debt securities held at
        December 31, 2006, $6 million mature within one year, $64 million mature
        after
        one year through five years, $44 million mature after five years through
        ten
        years and $50 million mature after ten years.

The
        following table shows proceeds from and realized gains and (losses) on sales

        for each of the Susquehanna units to extend their expiration dates from 2022
        to
        2042 for Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2.

Variable
      Interest Entities

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable
      Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 clarified that
      variable interest entities, as defined therein, that do not disperse risks
      among
      the parties involved should be consolidated by the entity that is determined
      to
      be the primary beneficiary. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 by issuing
      Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable
      Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," which is known as FIN
      46(R)
      and replaces FIN 46. FIN 46(R) does not change the general consolidation
      concepts of FIN 46. Among other things, FIN 46(R) clarifies certain provisions
      of FIN 46 and provides additional scope exceptions for certain types of
      businesses.

As
      permitted by FIN 46(R), PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 46 effective
      December 31, 2003, for entities created before February 1, 2003, that are
      considered to be SPEs. This adoption resulted in the consolidation of the
      lessors under the operating leases for the Sundance, University Park and Lower
      Mt. Bethel generation facilities, as well as the deconsolidation of two wholly
      owned trusts. See below for further discussion. Also, as permitted by FIN 46(R),
      PPL and its subsidiaries deferred the application of FIN 46 for other entities
      and adopted FIN 46(R) for all entities on March 31, 2004. The adoption of FIN
      46(R) did not have a material impact on the results of PPL and its
      subsidiaries.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Additional
      Entities Consolidated

In
      May
      2001, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a lease arrangement, as
      lessee, for the development, construction and operation of commercial power
      generation facilities. The lessor was created for the sole purpose of owning
      the
      facilities and incurring the related financing costs. The $660 million operating
      lease arrangement covered the 450 MW gas-fired Sundance project located in
      Pinal
      County, Arizona and the 540 MW gas-fired University Park project near University
      Park, Illinois. These facilities were substantially complete in July 2002,
      at
      which time the initial lease term commenced. In June 2004, PPL Energy Supply
      subsidiaries purchased the Sundance and University Park generation assets from
      the lessor. In May 2005, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply completed the sale
      of
      its Sundance generation assets to Arizona Public Service Company. See Note
      9 for
      further discussion of the sale.

In
      December 2001, another subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a $455
      million operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development,
      construction and operation of a 582 MW gas-fired combined-cycle generation
      facility located in Lower Mt. Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.
      The lessor was created for the sole purpose of owning the facilities and
      incurring the related financing costs. The initial lease term commenced on
      the
      date of commercial operation, which occurred in May 2004, and ends in December
      2013. The lease financing, which is included in "Long-term Debt," is secured
      by,
      among other things, the generation facility. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      the
      facility had a carrying value of $448 million and $459 million, net of
      accumulated depreciation and amortization of $27 million and $25 million, and
      was included in "Property, Plant and Equipment" and "Other acquired intangibles"
      on the Balance Sheets.

Entities
      Deconsolidated

(PPL)

In
      May
      2001, PPL and PPL Capital Funding Trust I, a wholly owned financing subsidiary
      of PPL, issued $575 million of 7.75% PEPS Units. Each PEPS Unit consisted of
      (i)
      a contract to purchase shares of PPL common stock on or prior to May 2004 and
      (ii) a trust preferred security of PPL Capital Funding Trust I with a maturity
      date of May 2006. The trust's sole source of funds for distributions were from
      payments of interest on 7.29% subordinated notes of PPL Capital Funding, due
      May
      18, 2006, that were issued to the trust. PPL guaranteed the payment of principal
      and interest on the subordinated notes issued to the trust by PPL Capital
      Funding. PPL also fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the trust's
      obligations under the trust preferred securities. All of the preferred
      securities of PPL Capital Funding Trust I were cancelled in 2004, and the trust
      was terminated in June 2004.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

SIUK
      Capital Trust I issued $82 million of 8.23% preferred securities maturing in
      February 2027 and invested the proceeds in 8.23% subordinated debentures
      maturing in February 2027 issued by SIUK Limited. Thus, the preferred securities
      are supported by a corresponding amount of subordinated debentures. SIUK Limited
      owned all of the common securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and guaranteed all
      of
      SIUK Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities. In January
      2003, SIUK Limited transferred its assets and liabilities, including the common
      securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and the obligations under the subordinated
      debentures, to WPD LLP. Therefore, WPD LLP currently guarantees all of SIUK
      Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities. SIUK Capital
      Trust
      I may, at the discretion of WPD LLP, be required to redeem the preferred
      securities, in whole or in part, at 104.115% of par beginning February 2007
      and
      thereafter at an annually declining premium over par through January 2017,
      after
      which time they are redeemable at par. See Note 16 for a discussion regarding
      the presentation of the related party transactions and Note 8 for a discussion
      regarding the redemption of the subordinated debentures as well as the common
      and preferred securities of SIUK Capital Trust I in February 2007.

New
      Accounting Standards

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

FIN

In
      July
      2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
      an
      interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." FIN 48 requires an entity to evaluate
      its tax positions following a two-step process. The first step requires an
      entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a
      particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50 percent
      chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes
      that
      the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of
      all
      the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an
      entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position
      that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The measurement
      of
      the benefit equals the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of
      realization, upon ultimate settlement, that exceeds 50 percent. If the
      more-likely-than-not threshold is unmet, it is inappropriate to recognize the
      tax benefits associated with the tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance
      on
      derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, classification, interest
      and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
      transition.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries will adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The adoption
      will
      result in the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
      balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. There is an exception for
      uncertain tax positions related to pre-acquisition tax contingencies, in which
      case the impact of adoption, first, adjusts goodwill in accordance with EITF
      Issue 93-7, "Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase Business
      Combination."

The
      primary impact of the adoption of FIN 48 is expected to be a reclassification
      between current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities. PPL and its subsidiaries
      currently estimate that current liabilities will decrease and noncurrent
      liabilities will increase within the following ranges:

PPL

PPL
                Energy Supply

PPL
                Electric

Current
                to Noncurrent Liability Reclassification

$

140-165

$

115-140

$

10-25

The
      cumulative effect adjustment as well as the remaining impact of the adoption
      is
      not expected to be material.

In
      addition to the Balance Sheet impacts, PPL and its subsidiaries expect that
      the
      adoption of FIN 48 will result in greater volatility in their effective tax
      rates. PPL and its subsidiaries do not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will
      result in an inability to comply with financial covenants under their debt
      agreements.

FSP
      No. FIN 46(R)-6

In
      April
      2006, the FASB issued FSP No. FIN 46(R)-6, "Determining the Variability to
      Be
      Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)." FSP No. FIN 46(R)-6
      provides that the variability to be considered in applying FIN 46 (revised
      December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
      of ARB 51," (FIN 46(R)) should be based on the design of the entity involved.
      PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FSP No. FIN 46(R)-6 effective July 1,
      2006. PPL and its subsidiaries did not elect to apply retrospective application
      to any period prior to the date of adoption. The initial adoption of FSP No.
      FIN
      46(R)-6 did not have an impact on PPL and its subsidiaries. However, the impact
      in periods subsequent to adoption could be material.

SAB

In
      September 2006, the SEC staff issued SAB No. 108, "Considering the Effects
      of
      Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
      Financial Statements." SAB 108 addresses the observed diversity in the
      quantification of financial statement misstatements and the potential, under
      current practice, for the build-up of improper amounts on the balance
      sheet.

The
      two
      most commonly used methods cited by the SEC for quantifying the effect of
      financial statement misstatements are the "roll-over" and "iron-curtain"
      methods. The roll-over method quantifies a misstatement based on the amount
      of
      the error originating in the current year income statement. This method ignores
      the effects of correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet
      misstatement that originated in prior years. Conversely, the iron-curtain method
      quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement
      existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, regardless of
      the
      misstatement's year(s) of origin.

In
      SAB
      108, the SEC requires a dual approach combining the roll-over method and the
      iron-curtain method. The dual approach requires quantification of financial
      statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the company's
      financial statements and the related financial statement
      disclosures.

SAB
      permits registrants to initially apply its provisions either by (i) restating
      prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or
      (ii)
      recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as
      adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of January
      1,
      2006, with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained
      earnings. Use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed
      disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected
      through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries adopted SAB 108 effective December 31, 2006. PPL and its
      subsidiaries previously utilized the dual approach when quantifying the impact
      of identified errors. Therefore, the adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
      impact on PPL and its subsidiaries.

SFAS
      123(R)

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment,"
      which is known as SFAS 123(R) and replaces SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation," as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." Among other things, SFAS 123(R)
      eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting
      for
      stock-based compensation. SFAS 123(R) requires public entities to recognize
      compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on
      the
      grant-date fair value of the awards. PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS
      123(R) effective January 1, 2006. PPL and its subsidiaries applied the modified
      prospective application transition method of adoption. Under this application,
      entities must recognize compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value
      for new awards granted or modified after the effective date and for unvested
      awards outstanding on the effective date. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not
      have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries, since PPL and its
      subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
      compensation, as described by SFAS 123, effective January 1, 2003. See Note
      12 for the disclosures required by SFAS 123(R).

      February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140." Among
      other things, SFAS 155 addresses certain accounting issues surrounding
      securitized financial assets and hybrid financial instruments with embedded
      derivatives that require bifurcation. PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS
      effective January 1, 2007. The initial adoption did not have an impact on PPL
      or
      its subsidiaries.

SFAS

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS 157
      provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for measuring fair
      value. In addition, SFAS 157 expands the fair value measurement disclosure
      requirements of other accounting pronouncements to require, among other things,
      disclosure of the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value as well
      as
      the earnings impact of certain fair value measurement techniques. SFAS 157
      does
      not expand the use of fair value in existing accounting pronouncements. PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 prospectively, except
      for
      financial instruments that were previously measured at fair value in accordance
      with footnote 3 of EITF Issue No. 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for
      Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
      Trading and Risk Management Activities," which require retrospective
      application. PPL and its subsidiaries must adopt SFAS 157 no later than January
      1, 2008. PPL and its subsidiaries are in the process of evaluating the impact
      of
      adopting SFAS 157. The potential impact of adoption is not yet determinable,
      but
      it could be material.

SFAS

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
      Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,

an
      amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." PPL and its
      subsidiaries adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS
      effective December 31, 2006. See Note 13 for the disclosures required by SFAS
      158.

SFAS

In
        February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial
        Assets and Financial Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement No.
        115." SFAS 159 provides entities with an option to measure, upon adoption
        of
        this pronouncement and at specified election dates, certain financial assets
        and
        liabilities at fair value, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
        securities, as well as other eligible items. The fair value option (i) may
        be
        applied on an instrument by instrument basis, with a few exceptions, (ii)
        is
        irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs), and (iii) is applied to
        an
        entire instrument not to only specified risks, cash flows, or portions of
        that
        instrument. An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for
        which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent
        reporting date.

SFAS
        also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
        comparisons between similar assets and liabilities measured using different
        attributes. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect the fair value
        option
        for eligible items that exist at that date, and shall report the effect of
        the
        first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
        opening balance of retained earnings.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries must adopt SFAS 159 no later than January 1, 2008. Early
        adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2007, for PPL and its subsidiaries
        provided that PPL and its subsidiaries (i) have not issued interim financial
        statements for 2007 and choose to early adopt SFAS 159 on or before
        April 30, 2007, and (ii) also elect to apply the provisions of Statement
        157.

PPL
        and
        its subsidiaries are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting
        SFAS
        159. The potential impact of adoption is not yet determinable, but it could
        be
        material.

(a)

PPL
                Electric's business is seasonal in nature, with peak sales periods
                generally occurring in the winter and summer months. In addition,
                earnings
                in certain quarters were affected by unusual items. Accordingly,
                comparisons among quarters of a year may not be indicative of overall
                trends and changes in operations.

Approval
      of Fees

The
      Audit
      Committee of PPL has procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services
      to be provided by the independent auditor. The procedures are designed to ensure
      the continued independence of the independent auditor. More specifically, the
      use of the independent auditor to perform either audit or non-audit services
      is
      prohibited unless specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee of
      PPL. As a result of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL has
      established specific categories of services and authorization levels. All
      services outside of the specified categories and all amounts exceeding the
      authorization levels are reviewed by the Chair of the Audit Committee of PPL,
      who serves as the Committee designee to review and approve audit and non-audit
      related services during the year. A listing of the approved audit and non-audit
      services is reviewed with the full Audit Committee of PPL no later than its
      next
      meeting.

The
      Audit
      Committee of PPL approved 100% of the 2006 and 2005 audit and non-audit related
      fees.
