PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

BACKGROUND

PPL Corporation

, headquartered in Allentown, PA, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994.  Through subsidiaries, PPL generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern U.S., markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in northeastern and northwestern portions of the U.S., delivers electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee and the U.K. and delivers natural gas in Kentucky.  On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.  Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE).  LKE is engaged in regulated uti
lity operations through its subsidiaries, KU and LG&E.  PPL acquired LKE for approximately $7.6 billion, including debt assumed through consolidation.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition.  The acquisition of LKE substantially reapportions the mix of PPL's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens PPL's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability.  An increase in regulated assets provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover costs of capital investments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions.  In 2011, PPL projects that 50% of its net income will be provided by its regulated businesses and the remainder will be provided by its c
ompetitive supply businesses.  As of December 31, 2010, PPL has:

·

More than $10 billion in projected annual revenues (up from $8.5 billion recorded by PPL in 2010 including two months of LKE revenue).

·

5.3 million utility customers (including 1.3 million served by the Kentucky-based companies).

·

Approximately 19,000 MW of generation (including 7,700 MW of regulated capacity in the Kentucky-based companies).

·

Approximately 14,000 full-time employees (including about 3,100 in Kentucky).

As of December 31, 2010, PPL's principal subsidiaries are shown below (* denotes a SEC registrant):

In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.

In addition to PPL Corporation, the other SEC registrants included in this filing are:

PPL Energy Supply, LLC

, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PPL formed in 2000, is an energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in the generation and marketing of electricity, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern power markets of the U.S. and in the delivery of electricity in the U.K.  PPL Energy Supply's major operating subsidiaries are PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Global.  As noted above, in January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Energy Supply owned or controlled 11,729 MW of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in Pennsylvania
 and Montana to provide 247 MW of additional generating capacity by 2013, and is in the process of disposing of certain non-core generation facilities with a capacity of 961 MW in 2011.

PPL Electric Utilities Corporation

, incorporated in 1920, is a direct subsidiary of PPL and a regulated public utility.  PPL Electric delivers electricity in its Pennsylvania service territory and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act.

PPL's utility subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent certain of its non-utility subsidiaries, are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC including:  wholesale sales of power and related transactions, electric transmission service, accounting practices, issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of utility properties and payments of dividends.  PPL is subject to certain FERC regulations as a holding company under PUHCA 2005 and the Federal Power Act, including with respect to accounting and record-keeping, inter-system sales of non-power goods and services and acquisitions of securities in, or mergers with, certain types of electric utility companies or holding companies.

Segment Information

(PPL)

Following the November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, PPL is organized into four segments:  Kentucky Regulated, International Regulated (formerly International Delivery), Pennsylvania Regulated (formerly Pennsylvania Delivery) and Supply.  Other than PPL adding a Kentucky Regulated segment, there were no other changes to reportable segments except the renaming of segments and allocating interest expense related to the Equity Units to the Kentucky Regulated segment.

(PPL Energy Supply)

At December 31, 2010

PPL Energy Supply's segments consisted of Supply and International Regulated (formerly International Delivery).  In 2010, there were no changes to these segments except the renaming of segments.  However, in January of 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.

Kentucky Regulated Segment

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU.  The Kentucky Regulated segment also includes interest expense related to the Equity Units issued in June 2010 to partially finance the acquisition of LKE.

LKE became a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL on November 1, 2010.  LG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee.  KU provides electric service to approximately 514,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, to approximately 30,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia and less than ten customers in Tennessee.  In Virginia, KU operates under the name Old Dominion Power Company.  KU also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in Kentucky.  LG&E provides electric service to approximately 395,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties.  
LG&E provides natural gas service to approximately 320,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky.

PPL Acquisition

In September 2010, the KPSC approved a settlement agreement among PPL and all of the intervening parties to PPL's joint application to the KPSC for approval of its acquisition of ownership and control of LKE.  In the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that LG&E and KU would commit that no base rate increases would take effect before January 1, 2013.  The rate increases for LG&E and KU that took effect on August 1, 2010 (as described below) are not impacted by the settlement.  Under the terms of the settlement, LG&E and KU retain the right to seek approval for the deferral of "extraordinary and uncontrollable costs."  Interim rate adjustments will continue to be permissible during that period through existing fuel, environmental and demand side management recovery mechanisms. &
#160;The agreement also substitutes an acquisition savings shared deferral mechanism for the previous requirement that LG&E and KU file a synergies plan with the KPSC post-closing.  This mechanism, which will be in place until the earlier of five years or the first day of the year in which a base rate increase becomes effective, permits LG&E and KU to each earn up to a 10.75% return on equity.  Any earnings above a 10.75% return on equity will be shared with customers on a 50%/50% basis.  The KPSC Order and the settlement agreement contained a number of other commitments by LG&E and KU with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters.

In October 2010, both the VSCC and the TRA approved the transfer of control of LKE to PPL.  Certain of these Orders contained additional commitments with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters.

Also in October 2010, the FERC approved the application for the transfer of control of the utilities.  The approval includes various conditional commitments, such as a continuation of certain existing undertakings with protesters in prior cases, an agreement not to terminate certain KU municipal customer contracts prior to January 2017, an exclusion of any transaction-related costs from wholesale energy and tariff customer rates to the extent that LG&E and KU have agreed to not seek recovery of the same transaction-related cost from retail customers and agreements to coordinate with protesters in certain open or ongoing matters.

Franchises and Licenses

LG&E and KU provide electric delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their various service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.

Competition

There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LKE.  Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky.  The nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted.  Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation which implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation; KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.

Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of LKE.  Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users.  Approximately 25% of LG&E's annual throughput is purchased by large commercial and industrial customers directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through LG&E's distribution system.  LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability.  However, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or 
other natural gas distribution systems.

In April 2010, the KPSC commenced a proceeding to investigate the regulatory, financial and operational aspects of natural gas retail competition programs, and the potential benefits to Kentucky consumers.  A number of entities, including LG&E, were parties to the proceeding.  In December 2010, the KPSC issued an Order in the proceeding declining to endorse natural gas competition at the retail level, noting the existence of a number of transition or oversight costs and an uncertain level of economic benefits in such programs.  With respect to existing natural gas transportation programs available to large commercial or industrial users, the Order indicates that the KPSC will review utilities' current tariff structures, user thresholds and other terms and conditions of such programs, as part of such utili
ties' next regular natural gas rate cases.

Electric Operations

LKE serves approximately 939,000 electric customers.  LKE's transmission and distribution system territory covers approximately 7,300 square miles.  For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, 83% of the Kentucky Regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from electric operations.  Details of electric revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010 are shown below.

Power Supply

At December 31, 2010, LKE owned, controlled or had ownership interest in generating capacity (winter rating) of 7,933 MW in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio.  See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of LKE's generating capacity.  For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, LKE's power plants generated 6,008 GWh of electricity.

During 2010, approximately 95% of the electricity generated by LG&E, and 98% of that generated by KU, was produced by their coal-fired electric generating stations.  The remainder was generated by natural gas and oil-fired combustion turbines and hydroelectric power plants.  Also during 2010, substantially all of the electricity generated was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base.

See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" and Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Unit 2 of the Trimble County generating station (TC2).

With limited exceptions LKE took care, custody and control of TC2 on January 22, 2011, and has dispatched the unit to meet customer demand since that date.  LG&E and KU and the contractor agreed to a further amendment of the construction agreement whereby the contractor will complete certain actions relating to identifying and completing any necessary modifications to allow operation of TC2 on all fuels in accordance with initial specifications prior to certain dates, and amending the provisions relating to liquidat
ed damages.

LKE cannot currently estimate the ultimate outcome of these matters.

LKE owns a 75% interest in Unit 2.  Unit 2 is coal-fired and has a capacity of 760 MW, of which LKE's share is 570 MW.

Fuel Supply

Coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E and KU for baseload generation for the foreseeable future, with natural gas and oil being used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.

Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units.  Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.

LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2016 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases.

For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western and eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, southern Indiana, southern Illinois and Ohio.  With the installation of flue gas desulfurization systems (sulfur dioxide removal systems, or scrubbers), LG&E and KU expect their use of higher sulfur coal to increase.  In 2011 and beyond, LG&E and KU may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Unit 2 of the Trimble County generating station.  Coal is delivered to the generating stations primarily by barge, truck and rail.

Natural Gas

LG&E purchases, transports, distributes or stores natural gas for 320,000 customers in Kentucky.  Its service area covers over 700 square miles in 17 counties and includes 391 miles of transportation mains, consisting of natural gas transmission lines of 255 miles, natural gas storage lines of 119 miles and natural gas combustion turbine lines of 17 miles.  LG&E's natural gas distribution system includes 4,235 miles of distribution mains.

For the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010, 17% of the Kentucky Regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from natural gas operations.  Shown below are details of natural gas revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010.

LG&E's natural gas billings include a weather normalization adjustment mechanism which adjusts the distribution cost component of residential and commercial customer bills based on normal temperatures during the heating season months of November through April, somewhat mitigating the effect of above- or below-normal weather on residential and commercial revenues.

Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 Bcf, help provide economical and reliable natural gas service to ultimate consumers.  By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads.  Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal the following winter heating season.  Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be forced to buy additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and when the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest.  Several suppliers under contracts of varying duration prov
ide competitively priced natural gas. The underground storage facilities, in combination with its purchasing practices, enable LG&E to offer natural gas sales service at competitive rates.  At December 31, 2010, LG&E had a 12 Bcf inventory balance of natural gas stored underground valued at $60 million.

A number of large commercial and industrial customers purchase their natural gas requirements directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through LG&E's distribution system.  These large commercial and industrial customers account for approximately 25% of LG&E's annual throughput.

Natural Gas Supply

LG&E also has a portfolio of supply arrangements of various terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations.  These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive.  In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.

LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines.  LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2013 and 2018.  Total winter capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer on-demand natural gas capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day.  LG&E has a contract with the other pipeline that expires in 2012.  Total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 51,000 MMBtu/day.

Rates and Regulation

LG&E and KU are subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC in virtually all matters related to electric and natural gas utility regulation.  In addition, KU is subject to the VSCC and the TRA.  LG&E and KU withdrew from the MISO in 2006.  Since exiting from the MISO, LG&E and KU have been operating under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.  LG&E and KU now contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. to function as their independent transmission operator, pursuant to FERC requirements.  Certain operations of LKE are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.  LKE is subject to certain FERC regulations as a holding comp
any under PUHCA 2005 and the Federal Power Act.

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and notes payable) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and environmental compliance costs recovered separately through the environmental cost recovery (ECR) mechanism.  As such, regulatory assets are generally earning a return.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.

KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base.  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates.  In January 2011, KU filed a notice of intent to file a rate case with the VSCC for the test year ended December 31, 2010.  The case is expected to be filed on or after April 1, 2011.

KU's wholesale requirements rates for municipal customers are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates.

See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.

2010 Kentucky Rate Case

In January 2010, LG&E and KU filed applications with the KPSC requesting increases in electric base rates of approximately 12%, or annual increases of $95 million and $135 million, respectively.  In addition, LG&E requested an increase in its natural gas base rates of approximately 8%, or $23 million annually.  In June 2010, LG&E and KU and certain intervenors agreed to a stipulation providing for increases in LG&E's and KU's electric base rates of $74 million and $98 million on an annual basis, and LG&E's natural gas base rates of $17 million on an annual basis, and those parties filed a request with the KPSC to approve such stipulation.  In July 2010, the KPSC issued an Order in the proceeding approving all the provisions of the stipulation, including a return on equity range of 9.75-10.
75%, with rates effective on and after August 1, 2010.

Virginia Rate Case

In June 2009, KU filed an application with the VSCC requesting an increase in electric base rates for its Virginia jurisdictional customers in an amount of $12 million annually or approximately 21%.  The proposed increase reflected a proposed rate of return on rate base of 8.586% based on a return of equity of 12%.  As permitted pursuant to a VSCC Order, KU elected to implement the proposed rates effective November 1, 2009, on an interim basis.  During December 2009, KU and the VSCC Staff agreed to a Stipulation and Recommendation authorizing a base rate revenue increase of $11 million annually and a return on rate base of 7.846% based on a 10.5% return on common equity.  In March 2010, the VSCC issued an Order approving the stipulation, with the increased rates to be put into effect as of April 1, 
2010.  As part of the stipulation, KU refunded approximately $1 million in interim rate amounts in excess of the ultimate approved rates.

FERC Wholesale Rate Case

In 2008, KU filed an application with the FERC for increases in electric base rates applicable to wholesale power sale contracts or interchange agreements involving, collectively, twelve Kentucky municipalities.  The application requested a shift from an all-in stated unit charge rate to an unbundled formula rate, including an annual adjustment mechanism.  In 2009, the FERC issued an Order approving a settlement among the parties in the case, incorporating increases of approximately 3% from prior rates and a return on equity of 11%.  In May 2010, KU submitted to the FERC the proposed current annual adjustments to the formula rates, which incorporated certain proposed increases.  Updated rates, including certain further adjustments from a review process involving wholesale requirements customers, bec
ame effective as of July 1, 2010.

International Regulated Segment

Includes WPD, a regulated electricity distribution company in the U.K.

WPD, headquartered in Bristol, England, operates two of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.  WPD (South West) serves 1.5 million end-users in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest England.  WPD (South Wales) serves 1.1 million end-users in a 4,550 square mile area within Wales.

Details of revenue by category for the years ended December 31, are shown below.

WPD's energy-related businesses revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunications and real estate.  WPD's telecommunication subsidiary derives revenue from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to WPD's overhead electricity distribution network.  WPD also provides meter services to businesses across the U.K.

Franchise and Licenses

WPD is authorized by the U.K. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations.  For instance, WPD is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.

Competition

Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network.  WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) are thus regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls.

Rates and Regulation

The operations of WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) are regulated under their distribution licenses under which income is generated subject to a price cap regulatory framework set by the regulatory body, Ofgem, that provides economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs.  The charges made for the use of the distribution networks are regulated on the basis of the "RPI plus/minus X" formula where RPI is a measure of inflation and X is an efficiency factor established by Ofgem following their review.  Under the review, Ofgem assesses the revenue and capital expenditure plans of companies and determines what they consider an efficient level of that expenditure.  Ofgem also considers the required cost of capital sufficient to encourage the required investment and determines customer s
ervice targets.  In December 2009, Ofgem completed its rate review for the period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015.  Ofgem allowed WPD an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 6.9% in each of the five years.  The revenue increase includes reimbursement to electricity distributors for higher operating and capital costs to be incurred.  Also, Ofgem set the weighted average cost of capital at 4.7%, which includes pre-tax debt and post-tax equity costs and excludes adjustments for inflation, for all distribution companies.  This is a 0.8% decrease from the previous regulatory period.  Additionally, Ofgem has established strong incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability or customer service.  In October 2010, Ofgem announced a new pricing model that will be effective for the electricity distribution sector, inclu
ding WPD, beginning April 2015.  The model, known as RIIO (Revenues = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), is intended to encourage investment in regulated infrastructure.  Key components of the model are: an extension of the price review period to eight years, increased emphasis on outputs and incentives, enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers, a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation, expansion of the current Low Carbon Network Fund to stimulate innovation and continued use of a single weighted average cost of capital.

Customers

The majority of WPD's revenue is derived from the delivery of electricity to end-users and thus its customers are the suppliers to those end-users.  It is a requirement of Ofgem that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement.  This agreement sets out how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to provide collateral.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

Includes the regulated electric delivery operations of PPL Electric.

PPL Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act.  PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central Pennsylvania.  PPL Electric also provides electricity supply in this territory as a PLR.

Franchise,  Licenses and Other Regulations

PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC.  PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions.  In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.

Competition

Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated transmission and distribution monopoly in its service area.  Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity transmission and distribution businesses.

Rates and Regulation

Transmission and Distribution

PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.

PJM serves as a FERC-approved RTO to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves.  Besides operating the electric transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.  A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets.  Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities.  PPL Electric is entitled to fully recover from customers the charges that it pays to PJM for transmission-related services.

In November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard Act (the AEPS), which requires electric distribution companies and retail electric suppliers to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from alternative energy sources by 2020.  Under this state law, alternative energy sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells.  If an electric distribution company is unable to meet these targets, it will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 (or, in the case of solar, 200% of the average market value of solar credits) for each MWh that it is short.  PPL Electric's initial compliance obligation covered the period January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2010.  PPL Electric was required to supply about 6.7% of the t
otal amount of electricity it delivered to its PLR customers from alternative energy sources during this period.  Under the PUC-approved Competitive Bridge Plan, PPL Electric obtained full requirements service that included the generation or credits that PPL Electric needed to comply with the AEPS in 2010.  AEPS compliance requirements for June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011 are about 9% of the total amount of electricity delivered to PLR Customers.

Act 129 became effective in October 2008.  The law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, establishes new PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing AEPS.

See "Regulatory Issues - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and PPL Electric's actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009.

PLR

The Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, to act as a PLR of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations established by the PUC.  As part of the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009.  To mitigate the risk that PPL Electric would not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the "capped" rates, PPL Electric entered into full-requirement energy supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation through the end of 2009.  Under these contracts, PPL EnergyPlus supplied PPL Electric's entire PLR load at predetermined prices equal to the capped generation rates that PPL Electric wa
s authorized to charge its customers.  Prior to the expiration of the rate caps, PPL Electric's customers had limited incentive to purchase generation supply from other providers because, in recent years, the contracts between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus provided a below-market price for these customers.  As a result, a limited amount of "shopping" occurred.

PPL Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 is governed by the PUC pursuant to the Public Utility Code as amended by Act 129, PLR regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations.  Effective January 1, 2010, PPL Electric's cost of electric generation is based on a competitive solicitation process.  The PUC has approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period January 2011 through May 2013 which includes 14 solicitations for supply beginning January 1, 2011 with a portion extending beyond May 2013.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric had contracted for all of the 2010 electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service in 2010. 
0;In addition, PPL Electric completed two solicitations in 2009 and four solicitations in 2010 for supply starting January 2011 to May 2015.  The solicitations include a mix of long-term and short-term purchases ranging from five months to five years to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide for customer supply as a PLR.  See "Energy Purchase Commitments" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL Electric's solicitations for 2011 and its actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2011.

In addition, several alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service territory.  Whether its customers purchase supply from these alternative suppliers or from PPL Electric as a PLR, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of PPL Electric.  The cost to purchase PLR supply is passed directly by PPL Electric to its customers without markup.

2010 Rate Case

In March 2010, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase distribution rates by approximately $115 million or approximately 2.4% over PPL Electric's projected 2010 revenues, to be effective January 1, 2011.  In December 2010, the PUC approved a settlement filed by the parties that provides for a rate increase of $77.5 million, or 1.6%, over PPL Electric's projected 2010 revenues.  The approved rates became effective for service rendered on and after January 1, 2011.  In January 2011, the PP&L Industrial Customers Alliance (PPLICA) filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the PUC's order regarding PPLICA's proposal for a special rate schedule for certain large commercial and industrial customers.  Also in January 2011, the PUC granted reconsideration for the purpose of evaluating the me
rits of the petition.  PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation.

Supply Segment

Owns and operates competitive

domestic power plants to generate electricity; markets and trades this electricity and other purchased power to competitive wholesale and retail markets; and acquires and develops competitive

domestic generation projects.  Consists primarily of the activities of PPL Generation and PPL EnergyPlus.

PPL Energy Supply has generation assets that are located in the eastern and northwestern U.S. markets.  The eastern generation assets are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic energy markets, including PJM and ISO New England.  PPL Energy Supply's northwestern generating capacity is located in Montana.

Details of revenue by category for the years ended December 31, are shown below.

(a)

Included in these amounts are $320 million, $1,806 million and $1,826 million of wholesale electric sales to an affiliate which are eliminated in consolidation for PPL.

(b)

In addition to these amounts, PPL has $11 million, $12 million and $8 million of revenue which is not applicable to PPL Energy Supply.

The Supply segment's energy-related businesses revenues include activities that primarily support its generation, marketing and trading businesses.  These activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers, through its mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries.  The renewable energy business builds, owns, operates and maintains renewable energy facilities throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, and includes solar, wind and landfill gas to energy plants.  At December 31, 2010, the renewable energy business owned and operated 33 MW of renewable capacity.  The revenues of the mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries are included in "Energy-related businesses" on the Statements of Inc
ome.

Customer Choice Act

In 1996, the Customer Choice Act was enacted to restructure Pennsylvania's electric utility industry in order to create retail access to a competitive market for generation of electricity.  The Customer Choice Act required each Pennsylvania electric utility to file a restructuring plan to "unbundle" its rates into separate generation, transmission and distribution components and to permit its customers to directly access alternate suppliers of electricity.  Under the Customer Choice Act, regulated utilities were required to act as a PLR.  As part of a settlement approved by the PUC, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric entered into full requirements energy supply agreements at predetermined "capped" rates through the end of 2009.

With the expiration of the long-term power purchase agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, PPL EnergyPlus has multiple options as to how, and to whom, it sells the electricity produced by PPL Energy Supply's generation plants.  These sales are based on prevailing market rates.  The expiration of the long-term supply agreements with PPL Electric also enables PPL Energy Supply to adjust its exposure to fluctuations in demand that existed with supplying PPL Electric's PLR load.  Entry of new generation suppliers into the Pennsylvania marketplace provides PPL Energy Supply the opportunity to provide generation supply to additional wholesale customers but also exposes the Supply segment to increased competition (see "Competition" below).

Power Supply

PPL Energy Supply owned or controlled generating capacity (winter rating) of 11,729 MW at December 31, 2010.  Through subsidiaries, PPL Generation owns and operates power plants in Pennsylvania, Montana, Illinois and Connecticut.  Generating capacity controlled by PPL Generation and other PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through PPL EnergyPlus' tolling or power purchase agreements (including Ironwood and other facilities that consist of NUGs, wind farms and landfill gas facilities).  See "Item 2. Properties - Supply Segment" for a complete listing of PPL Energy Supply's generating capacity.

See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information on the 2010 sale of the Long Island Generation business, consisting of plants in New York and the 2010 and 2009 sales of hydroelectric facilities located in Maine.  Also, see Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information on the anticipated sale of certain non-core generation facilities consisting of natural gas-fired facilities in Wallingford, Connecticut and University Park, Illinois and a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary's interest in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in Conestoga, Pennsylvania.

PPL Energy Supply's generation subsidiaries are EWGs, which sell electricity into wholesale markets.  EWGs are subject to regulation by the FERC, which has authorized these EWGs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices.  This electricity is sold to PPL EnergyPlus under FERC-jurisdictional power purchase agreements.

PPL Susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of the Susquehanna nuclear units.  Certain of PPL Energy Supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices.  Certain operations of PPL Generation's subsidiaries are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.

The system capacity of PPL Energy Supply's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.

During 2010, PPL Energy Supply's power plants, excluding renewable facilities that are discussed separately below, generated the following amounts of electricity.

(a)

15 million kWhs were excluded as tolling agreements were in place for 100% of the output.

This generation represented a 4% increase above 2009 output.  Of this generation, 50% of the electricity generated was from coal-fired stations, 29% from the Susquehanna nuclear station, 14% from oil/natural gas-fired stations and 7% from hydroelectric stations.

Substantially all of PPL Energy Supply's total expected generation in 2011 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales.  PPL Energy Supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2012 and beyond.  These commitments are consistent with, and integral to, PPL Energy Supply's business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices.  See "Commodity Volumetric Activity" in Note 19 to the Financial Statements for the strategies PPL Energy Supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio.

PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont and New Hampshire with a generating capacity (winter rating) of 33 MW.  PPL EnergyPlus sells the energy and RECs produced by these plants to commercial, industrial and institutional customers.  During 2010, the projects owned and operated by these PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries generated 154 million kWhs.

PPL EnergyPlus purchases the capacity, energy and RECs from two wind farms in Pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 MW.  These contracts extend through 2027.

See "Item 2. Properties - Supply Segment" for additional information regarding PPL Generation's plans for capital projects in Pennsylvania and Montana that are expected to provide 247 MW of additional electric generating capacity by 2013.

Fuel Supply

PPL EnergyPlus acts as agent for PPL Generation to procure and optimize its various fuels.

Coal

Pennsylvania

PPL EnergyPlus actively manages PPL's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern Appalachia.

During 2010, PPL Generation purchased 100% of the coal delivered to PPL Generation's wholly owned Pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts.  These contracts provided PPL Generation 7.0 million tons of coal.  Contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.9 million tons of coal in 2011.  The amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations.

PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, has an agreement that provides more than one-third of PPL Generation's projected annual coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2011 through 2018.  PPL Generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for their projected annual needs from 2011 through 2013.

A PPL Generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the Keystone station and in Keystone Fuels, LLC and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station and in Conemaugh Fuels, LLC.  The Keystone station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for its coal requirements, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the Keystone station in 2010.  The Conemaugh station requirements are purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC, which provided 4.0 million tons of coal to the Conemaugh station in 2010.

All PPL Generation Pennsylvania coal stations have scrubbers installed.  Limestone is necessary to operate the scrubbers.  Acting as agent for PPL Brunner Island, LLC and PPL Montour, LLC, PPL EnergyPlus has entered into long-term contracts with limestone suppliers that will provide for those plants' limestone requirements through 2012.  During 2010, 457,000 tons of limestone were delivered to Brunner Island and Montour under long-term contracts.  Annual limestone requirements approximate 600,000 tons.

Montana

PPL Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3.  NorthWestern owns a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 4.  PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4.  However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs.  PPL Montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications.  PPL Montana, along with the other owners, has a long-term purchase 
and supply agreement with the current supplier for Units 1 and 2 which, provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through December 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from January 2015 through December 2019.  The coal supply contract for Unit 3's requirements is in effect through December 2019.

These units were built with scrubbers and PPL Montana has entered into a long-term contract that commences in January 2011 through December 31, 2030, to purchase the lime requirements for these units.

Coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette station.  The contracts covered 100% of the station's coal requirements in 2010, and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2012.

Oil and Natural Gas

Pennsylvania

PPL Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased on the spot market while oil requirements were supplied from inventory.  At December 31, 2010, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units.

Short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel facility.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for Lower Mt. Bethel were purchased on the spot market.

In 2008, PPL EnergyPlus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the Ironwood facility.  PPL EnergyPlus has long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of Ironwood's maximum daily requirements, which began in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Ironwood will be served through a combination of transportation capacity release transactions and delivered supply to the plant.  PPL EnergyPlus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for Ironwood.  During 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for Ironwood were purchased on the spot market.

Illinois

At December 31, 2010, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the University Park facility.

Connecticut

PPL EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas.

Nuclear

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

PPL Susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services.  These contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2017.  PPL Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units.

Federal law requires the U.S. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational.  As a result, it was necessary to expand Susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity.  To support this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology.  The facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed.  The facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999.  PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approxi
mately 2017 under current operating conditions.  If necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant.

In 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998.  In 1997, the Court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially adequate remedy if the DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998.  The DOE did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel by that date.  The DOE continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages.  In January 2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. &#
160;Discovery in the case has concluded but the Court has not yet set a date for trial.  PPL cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

Energy Marketing

PPL EnergyPlus sells the capacity and electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, FTRs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and RECs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets.

PPL EnergyPlus purchases and sells capacity and electricity at the wholesale level at competitive prices under FERC market-based prices.  Within the constraints of its hedging policy, PPL EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations.

PPL EnergyPlus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and provides retail natural gas supply to customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.

Competition

Since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in U.S. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives.  While some states, such as Pennsylvania and Montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industry.  Some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration.  In addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers.  The activity around re-regulation, however, has slowed due to the current 
environment of declining power prices.  As such, the competitive markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive.

The Supply segment faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services.  Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  The Supply segment primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  Competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiari
es of regulated utilities and other energy marketers.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Supply Segment" and PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets.

Franchise and Licenses

See "Background - Segment Information - Supply Segment - Energy Marketing" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses in various states.  PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the DOE to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.

PPL Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating licenses that expire in 2042 for Unit 1 and in 2044 for Unit 2.

In 2008, PPL Susquehanna received NRC approval for its request to increase the generation capacity of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The project is being completed in phases over several years.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the total expected capacity increase is estimated to be 195 MW.  The final phase of the Unit 1 uprate was completed in 2010 and yielded 55 MW for PPL Susquehanna.  The final phase of the Unit 2 uprate is scheduled for 2011 and is projected to yield an additional 50 MW for PPL Susquehanna.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the expected remaining expenditures is $15 million.

In 2008, a PPL subsidiary submitted a COLA to the NRC for a new nuclear generating unit (Bell Bend) to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna plant. Also in 2008, the COLA was accepted for review by the NRC.  In February 2010, the NRC published its official review schedule that culminates with the issuance of Bell Bend's final safety evaluation report in 2012.  See Note 8 to Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license that was recently extended by the FERC to expire in 2030.  PPL Holtwood operates the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044.  PPL Holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation (Safe Harbor), which holds a project license that extends operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030.  The total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating station was 423 MW at December 31, 2010, and PPL Holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity.  In September 2010, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries signed definitive agreements to sell their ownership interests in Safe Harbor 
and two other non-core generating facilities.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

In October 2009, the FERC approved the request to expand the Holtwood plant and extended the operating license through August 2030.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in Montana are licensed by the FERC.  The FERC license for the Mystic facility was relicensed, effective January 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year term.  The Thompson Falls and Kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine Missouri-Madison facilities expire in 2040.

In connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the FERC to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or allow the U.S. government to take over the facility.  If the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the Kerr Dam license.

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

SEASONALITY

The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather.  As a result, PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

See PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this information.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for the years 2011-2015.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

PPL and its subsidiaries are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters.  The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations over the next few years that will directly affect the electric industry.  These initiatives cover all sources - air, water and waste.  See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2010 and projected environmental capital expenditures fo
r the years 2011-2015.  Also, see "Environmental Matters" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  To comply with air related requirements, PPL's forecast for capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years.  Such projections are a combined $2.1 billion for LG&E and KU and $400 million for PPL Energy Supply.  Actual costs may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements.  Environmental compliance costs incurred by LG&E and KU are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions.  In complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, GHG emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities.  PPL's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with their businesses.  While we have identified below the risks we currently consider material, these are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 15 to the Financial
 Statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results.

As used in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International Regulated segment discussions, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Regulated segment discussion.

Risks Related to All Segments

(

PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric

)

We will selectively pursue growth of generation and transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.

We will pursue expansion of our generation and transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure.  We will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion.  These types of projects involve numerous risks.  Any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs.  With respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of ex
isting plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.  The success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals.  If we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project.  Furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings.

Adverse conditions in the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse conditions in the financial markets during 2008 and the associated contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets contributed significantly to declines in wholesale energy prices, significantly impacting our earnings during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009.  The breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. and international business environment, including our businesses.  As a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities has declined significantly.  This reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as PJM) and our Pennsylvania and Kentucky utility businesses, especially industrial customer demand.  The combination of lower demand for power and natu
ral gas and other fuels has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results.  In general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition.

Our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business.  Global bank credit capacity declined and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, thereby introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit.  Although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. 
 Additionally, regulations to be adopted to implement the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act of 2010 may impose requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent.

Our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions.

Our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles.  For example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or severe storms occur.  The patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity.

Operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental

disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters.

Weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure or requiring significant repair costs. Storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues or increase expenses, due to reduced usage and higher restoration charges.  In addition, weather and other disturbances may affect capital markets and general economic conditions and impact future growth.

Our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential

effects of climate change.

Climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation changes, and thus may impact consumer demand for electric power. Temperature increases could result in increased overall electricity volumes or peaks and precipitation changes could result in altered availability of water for plant cooling operations. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. Conversely, climate change could have a number of potential impacts tending to reduce demand. Changes may entail more frequent or more intense storm activity, which, if severe, could temporarily disrupt regional economic conditions and adversely affect electricity demand levels.  Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electric powe
r, particularly power generated by fossil-fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on the regional economy. Reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas --both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously low-cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. Also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electric usage generally.

We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities.  An adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues" and in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case.

We could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond

credit ratings or other negative developments in our ability to access capital

markets.

In the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing means to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt interest or maturities and operating needs. As a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rate levels; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. Changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased liquidity to our domestic regulated utility businesses.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt.

Credit ratings assigned by Moody's, Fitch and S&P to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses.  Although we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ratings Triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating.

Significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity.

We continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses.  However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations.  Increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors.  In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees.  We provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees.  These benefits give rise to significant expenses.  Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, 
the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits.  In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees.  The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control.  These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants.  If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contri
bution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly.

We may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings.

Under GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.  Although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2010, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary.

We also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  See Notes 8, 9 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information on impairment charges taken during the reporting periods.  We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years.

We may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations.

In connection with various divestitures, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities and with respect to certain transactions. These indemnities and guarantees relate to, among other things, liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture.

We are

subject to liability risks relating to our generation,

transmission and distribution businesses.

The conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial effects, caused to or caused by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties.

Our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance.

Operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. These events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently or lead to increased costs, expenses or losses.  Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue or increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers.  Planned and unplanned outages at our power plants can require us to purchase pow
er at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them.

Although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur.

We are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations.

Changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations.  We are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities.  These tax obligations include income, property, sales and use and employment-related taxes.  We also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. Due to the revenue needs of the states and jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered.  We cannot predict whether legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses.  If enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a negative impact on ou
r results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to Domestic Regulated Utility Operations

Our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to the Kentucky Regulated segment and the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.  Set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments.

Our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments.  Regulators may not approve the rates we request.

We currently provide services to our utility customers at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including those commissions referred to below.  While such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our regulated generation, transmission and distribution customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities.  There can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments.  While our rates are generally reg
ulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. With respect to PPL's November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, each of LG&E and KU has agreed with the KPSC, subject to certain limited exceptions such as fuel and environmental cost recoveries, that no base rate increases would take effect for their Kentucky retail customers before January 1, 2013.  Our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators.  If our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental

regulation.

Various federal and state entities, including but not limited to the FERC, the KPSC, the VSCC, the TRA and PUC regulate many aspects of the domestic utility operations of PPL, including:

·

the rates that we may charge and the terms and conditions of our service and operations;

·

financial and capital structure matters;

·

siting, construction and operation of facilities;

·

mandatory reliability and safety standards and other standards of conduct;

·

accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies;

·

tax matters;

·

affiliate restrictions;

·

acquisition and disposal of utility assets and securities; and

·

various other matters.

Such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties. In any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek.

We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards.

Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties which may not be recoverable from customers.

Changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or

reduce revenues.

Wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. Changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not estimable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. These can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which PPL participates.

Our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject

to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of

resulting costs.

The domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of LKE) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. The completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including:

·

approval, licensing and permitting;

·

land acquisition and the availability of suitable land;

·

skilled labor or equipment shortages;

·

construction problems or delays, including disputes with third party intervenors;

·

increases in commodity prices or labor rates;

·

contractor performance;

·

environmental considerations and regulations;

·

weather and geological issues; and

·

political, labor and regulatory developments.

Failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators.

Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment

(

PPL

)

The costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are

significant and are subject to continuing changes.

Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to LG&E's and KU's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business related activities; and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material. In addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules are expanded or changed.  Costs may take the form of increased capital or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industr
ial power users, and may impact the costs of their products or demand for our services.

Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

(

PPL and PPL Electric

)

We may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of PJM's regional transmission expansion plan (RTEP) process.

PJM and the FERC have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners.  As discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line that PJM has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid.  Although the FERC has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable.  In addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, whether due to delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control.  As a resul
t, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other RTEP projects on PPL Electric.

We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to Pennsylvania Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs.

Act 129 became effective in October 2008.  This law created requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposed new PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provided remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard.  The law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013).  Utilities not meeting these requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates.  Although we expect to meet these requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us.  See "Regul
atory Issues - Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Reliability Standards" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Cost recovery remains subject to political risks.

Although prior initiatives have not resulted in the enactment of such legislation, the possibility remains that certain Pennsylvania legislators could introduce legislation to reinstate generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for Pennsylvania utilities after the end of applicable transition periods, which in PPL Electric's case was December 31, 2009.  If such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls.  In addition, continuing uncertainty regarding PPL Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its b
usiness.

Risks Related to International Regulated Segment

Our U.K. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance.

Our U.K. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework.  In addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance.  Disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that Ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels.

In December 2009, Ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2015, thus reducing regulatory rate risk in the International Regulated segment until the next rate review which will be effective April 1, 2015.  The regulated income of the International Regulated segment and also the RAB are to some extent linked to movements in the Retail Price Index (RPI).  Reductions in the RPI would adversely impact revenues and the debt/RAB ratio.

Our U.K. distribution business exposes us to risks related to U.K. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the U.K. government.  These risks may reduce the results of operations from our U.K. distribution business.

The acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the U.K. entail significant financial risks including:

·

changes in laws or regulations relating to U.K. operations, including tax laws and regulations;

·

changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements;

·

changes in general economic conditions affecting the U.K.;

·

regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies;

·

severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets;

·

changes in labor relations;

·

limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors;

·

limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans;

·

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in converting U.K. revenues to U.S. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and

·

compliance with U.S. foreign corrupt practices laws.

Risks Related to Supply Segment

(

PPL and PPL Energy Supply

)

We face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.

Unlike our regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure.  Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.  These competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business.

We sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration.  Competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability.  We believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity.

We also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services.  We primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  We also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have.

Competitors in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities.  In the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector.  Entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of PUHCA in 2006.  The repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have.

Adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, RECs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs.  Unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production.  As a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.  Among the factors that influence such prices are:

·

supply and demand for electricity available from current or new generation resources;

·

variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity;

·

transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served;

·

changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets;

·

liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and

·

weather and economic conditions impacting demand for electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity.

See Exhibit 99(a) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five years.

We do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility.

We attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts.  We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities.  However, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

We are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets.

We purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the FERC throughout the U.S. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations.  If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages.  These damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity.  Depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental com
pliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity.

Our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  We currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts.  Our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. See Note 7 for a discussion of PPL's credit facilities.

We also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract.  Whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts.  However, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages.

The load following contracts that PPL EnergyPlus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins.

We generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation.  If the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss.  Alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market.  Therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared to our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation
s or financial position.

We may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities.

We purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations.

Our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs.

We actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions.  We have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics.  Nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned.  For example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations.  Additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrea
se market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions.  We enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery.  Similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address.  As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position.

In addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk.  We have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk.  However, if counterparties fail to perform, the risk of which has increased due to the economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.  In that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected.

Our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.

Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection.  To comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance.

In order to comply with existing and proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 PPL began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction).  The cost to install this equipment was approximately $1.6 billion.  The scrubbers at our Montour and Brunner Island plants are now in service.  Many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict.  As a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently 
in effect, which could require us to significantly increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment.

We may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs.  Furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units.

For more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

We rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity.  If transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered.

We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities.  If transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by ISOs and RTOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products at the most favorable terms.

The FERC has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis.  Although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require.  We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs and RTOs in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services.

Despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities.

Our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market.  Generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC.  The FERC has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.  The FERC retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates.  Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  See "FERC Market-Based Rate Authority" in
 Note 15 to the Financial Statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's market-based rate authority program, and "PJM RPM Litigation" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for information regarding the FERC's proceedings that could impact PJM's capacity pricing model.

In addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs.

If market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities.  The ISOs that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address extremely high prices in the power markets.  These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms.  Although we generally expect electricity markets to 
continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. See "New Jersey Capacity Legislation" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

Changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants.

A basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices.  There are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns.  Research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies.  It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production.  Also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by custome
rs could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators.  These alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants.  As a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced.

We are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life.

Nuclear generation accounted for about 29% of our 2010 generation output.  The risks of nuclear generation generally include:

·

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

·

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and

·

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.  The licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the ARO related to the decommissioning.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  In addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.  There also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to PPL that cannot be predicted.  In addition, although we have no reason t
o anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our Susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.  Terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary.  Dollars are in millions unless otherwise noted.

PPL, headquartered in Allentown, PA, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994.  Through subsidiaries, PPL generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern U.S., markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in northeastern and northwestern portions of the U.S., delivers electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee and the U.K. and delivers natural gas in Kentucky.  On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.  Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE).  LKE is engaged in regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, KU and LG&E.  
;PPL acquired LKE for approximately $7.6 billion, including debt assumed through consolidation.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition.  The acquisition of LKE substantially reapportions the mix of PPL's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens PPL's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability.  The increase in regulated assets provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover costs of capital investments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions.  In 2011, PPL projects that 50% of its net income will be provided by its regulated businesses and the remainder will be provided by its competitive supply businesses.  As of December 31, 201
0, PPL has:

·

More than $10 billion in projected annual revenues (up from $8.5 billion recorded by PPL in 2010 including two months of LKE revenue).

·

5.3 million utility customers (including 1.3 million served by the Kentucky-based companies).

·

Approximately 19,000 MW of generation (including 7,700 MW of regulated capacity in the Kentucky-based companies).

·

Approximately 14,000 full-time employees (including about 3,100 in Kentucky).

As of December 31, 2010, PPL's principal subsidiaries are shown below (* denotes a SEC registrant):

In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.

PPL's overall strategy is to achieve stable, long-term growth in its regulated electricity delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations, and disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings.  More specifically, PPL's strategy for its regulated businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer service and reliability, as well as grow this part of the business.  PPL's strategy for its competitive electricity generation and marketing businesses is to match energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy and fuel price volatility
, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL's business is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and liquidity position.  In addition, PPL has adopted financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating units.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks PPL faces in its businesses.

Following the November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, PPL is organized into four segments:  Kentucky Regulated, International Regulated (formerly International Delivery), Pennsylvania Regulated (formerly Pennsylvania Delivery) and Supply.  Other than PPL adding a Kentucky Regulated segment, there were no other changes to reportable segments except the renaming of segments and allocating interest expense related to the Equity Units to the Kentucky Regulated segment.  Refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for additional information on PPL's reportable segments.

"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" provides information concerning PPL's performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

·

"Results of Operations" provides an overview of PPL's operating results in 2010, 2009 and 2008, including a review of earnings, with details of results by reportable segment.  It also provides a brief outlook for 2011.

·

"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" provides an analysis of PPL's liquidity position and credit profile, including its sources of cash (including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow) and uses of cash (including contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements) and the key risks and uncertainties that impact PPL's past and future liquidity position and financial condition.  This subsection also includes rating agency actions on PPL's credit ratings.

·

"Financial Condition - Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other" provides an explanation of PPL's risk management programs relating to market risk and credit risk.

·

"Application of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of PPL and that require its management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments.

See "Item 1. Business - Background - Segment Information - Pennsylvania Regulated Segment" for a discussion of PPL Electric's PLR obligations, PPL Electric's agreement to provide electricity as a PLR at "capped" rates through the end of 2009, and plans for default electricity supply procurement after 2009.

When comparing 2010 with 2009, certain line items on PPL's financial statements were impacted by the Customer Choice Act, Act 129 and other related issues.  Overall, the expiration of generation rate caps and a long-term full requirements contract between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric at the end of 2009 had a significant positive impact on PPL's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows during 2010.

The primary impact of the expiration of these generation rate caps and this contract is reflected in PPL's unregulated gross energy margins.  See "Statement of Income Analysis" for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.  In 2010, PPL sold the majority of its generation supply to unaffiliated parties under various wholesale and retail contracts at prevailing market rates at the time the contracts were executed.  In 2009, the majority of generation produced by PPL's generation plants was sold to PPL Electric's customers as PLR supply under predetermined capped rates.

Regarding PPL's Pennsylvania regulated electric delivery operations, the expiration of generation rate caps, the resulting competitive solicitations for power supply, the migration of customers to alternative suppliers, the Customer Choice Act and Act 129 had minimal impact on Pennsylvania gross delivery margins, as approved recovery mechanisms allow for cost recovery of associated expenses, including the cost of energy provided as a PLR.  However, PPL Electric's 2010 Pennsylvania gross delivery margins were negatively impacted by the expiration of CTC recovery in December 2009.  PPL Electric continues to remain the delivery provider for all customers in its service territory and charge a regulated rate for the service of delivering electricity.  See "Statement of Income Analysis - Margins - Pennsylvania Gros
s Delivery Margins" for additional information.

See "Regulatory Issues - Enactment of Financial Reform Legislation" in Note 15 for information on the Dodd-Frank Act.

Results of Operations

Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Segment Results" and "Statement of Income Analysis" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained.  Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rate.

The changes in Net Income Attributable to PPL Corporation from year to year were, in part, due to several special items that management considers significant.  Details of these special items are provided within the review of each segment's earnings.

The "Statement of Income Analysis" explains the year-to-year changes in significant earnings components, including certain income statement line items, unregulated gross energy margins by region and Pennsylvania gross delivery margins by component.  As a result of the November 1, 2010, acquisition, LKE's results for the two months ended December 31, 2010 are included in PPL's results with no comparable amounts for 2009.  When discussing PPL's results of operations for 2010 compared with 2009, the results of LKE are isolated for purposes of comparability.  LKE's results are shown separately within "Segment Results - Kentucky Regulated Segment."  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition.

Other operation and maintenance increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to increased payroll-related costs, higher contractor-related costs and other costs at Susquehanna.  Also contributing to the increase were higher support group costs, higher expenses at western fossil/hydro plants due to the Corette overhaul and lease expense related to the use of the streambeds in Montana.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on continuing litigation regarding the streambeds in Montana.

Other operation and maintenance increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to increased payroll-related costs, higher contractor-related costs and other costs

at generation plants.

·

Depreciation increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to the Brunner Island environmental equipment that was placed in service in 2009 and early 2010.

Depreciation increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to the scrubbers at Brunner Island and Montour and portions of the Susquehanna uprate projects that were placed in service in 2008 and 2009.

·

Income taxes decreased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to a release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets for Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards, investment tax credits at Holtwood and Rainbow, a release of tax reserves in 2010, and a tax benefit from the manufacturing deduction.

This economic activity will continue to be realized through May 2013.

2011 Outlook

Excluding special items, lower earnings are projected from the Supply segment in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices in the East, higher average fuel costs, and higher operation and maintenance expense.

Earnings beyond 2010 are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

Statement of Income Analysis --

Margins

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two non-GAAP financial measures:  "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" and "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins."  PPL believes that these measures provide additional criteria to make investment decisions.  These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, internally by senior management and the Board of Directors to manage its operations.  PPL's management also uses "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" in measuring certain corporate performance goals used in determining variable compensation.

·

"Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" is a single financial performance measure of PPL's competitive energy non-trading and trading activities.  In calculating this measure, the Supply segment's energy revenues are offset by the cost of fuel and energy purchases, and adjusted for other related items.  This performance measure is relevant to PPL due to the volatility in the individual revenue and expense lines on the Statements of Income that comprise "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins."  This volatility stems from a number of factors, including the required netting of certain transactions with ISOs and significant swings in unrealized gains and losses.  Such factors could result in gains or losses being recorded in either "Wholesale energy marketing" or "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income.  This performance measure includes PLR revenues from energy sales to P
PL Electric by PPL EnergyPlus.  In addition, PPL excludes from "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" the Supply segment's energy-related economic activity, which includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL's competitive generation assets, full-requirement and retail activities.  This economic value is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the delivery period that was hedged.  Also included in this energy-related economic activity is the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges, net losses on the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and premium amortization associated with options.  This economic activity is deferred, with the exception of the net losses on the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized, and included in unregulated gross energy margins over the delivery pe
riod that was hedged or upon realization.

·

"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of PPL's Pennsylvania regulated electric delivery operations, which includes transmission and distribution activities, including PLR supply.  In calculating this measure, Pennsylvania regulated utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset.  These mechanisms allow for full cost recovery of certain expenses; therefore, certain expenses and revenues offset with minimal impact on earnings.  As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from PPL's Pennsylvania regulated electric delivery operations.

These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  Other companies may use different measures to analyze and to report on the results of their operations.

Eastern U.S.

Eastern U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to significantly higher pricing in 2010 for eastern baseload generation compared with prices realized under the PLR contract with PPL Electric that expired at the end of 2009.  Partially offsetting the increase were lower realized margins from full-requirement sales contracts due to lower customer demand and customer migration.

Eastern U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower margins on full-requirement sales contracts resulting from mild weather, decreased demand, and customer migration.  Also contributing to the decrease were higher average baseload generation fuel costs, primarily due to higher coal prices.  Partially offsetting these lower margins were net gains resulting from the settlement of economic positions associated with rebalancing portfolios to better align them with current strategies, higher capacity revenue, higher baseload generation output due to unplanned major outages in 2008, and an increase in the PLR sales prices in accordance with the PUC Final Order.

Western U.S.

Western U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower volumes.

Western U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to higher wholesale volumes and increased generation from the hydroelectric units.

Net Energy Trading

Net energy trading margins decreased in 2010 compared with 2009, consisting of lower trading margins related to power and gas, partially offset by higher trading margins related to FTRs.

Net energy trading margins increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to increased margins in the power, gas and oil trading positions resulting from unrealized trading losses in 2008 due to a dramatic decline in energy prices and a severe contraction of liquidity in the wholesale power markets.

Distribution

The decrease in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to margins realized in 2009 related to the collection of CTC, which ended in December 2009, partially offset by favorable recovery mechanisms for certain energy related costs.

The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower CTC/ITC margins in 2009, ITC collections ended in 2008.  Lower margins were also attributable to unfavorable economic conditions, including industrial customers scaling back on production.  In addition, weather had an unfavorable impact on sales volumes, offset by favorable price increases.

Transmission

The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to increased investment in rate base, an increase in the cost of capital due to an increase in equity and the recovery of additional costs through FERC formula-based rates.

See "Regulatory Issues - Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Reliability Standards" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(c)

For the period 2010 compared to 2009, $21 million relates to lower impairment charges of sulfur dioxide emission allowances.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  Partially offsetting the decrease was a $5 million increase in the charge for the settlement of a dispute regarding the sale of certain annual nitrogen oxide allowance put options.

For the period 2009 compared to 2008, $33 million relates to lower impairment charges of nitrogen oxide allowances partially offset by $37 million of higher impairment charges of sulfur dioxide allowances.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  Also contributing to the difference was a $13 million decrease in the charge for the settlement of a dispute regarding the sale of certain annual nitrogen oxide allowance put options.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

PPL expects to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and its credit facilities.  Additionally, subject to market conditions, PPL currently plans to access capital markets in 2011.

PPL's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to:

·

changes in market prices for electricity;

·

changes in commodity prices that may increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount PPL receives from selling power;

·

operational and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale power markets;

·

potential ineffectiveness of the trading, marketing and risk management policy and programs used to mitigate PPL's risk exposure to adverse electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit;

·

unusual or extreme weather that may damage PPL's transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers;

·

reliance on transmission and distribution facilities that PPL does not own or control to deliver its electricity and natural gas;

·

unavailability of generating units (due to unscheduled or longer-than-anticipated generation outages, weather and natural disasters) and the resulting loss of revenues and additional costs of replacement electricity;

·

the ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses;

·

costs of compliance with existing and new environmental laws and with new security and safety requirements for nuclear facilities;

·

any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations with respect to PPL's current and past business activities;

·

deterioration in the financial markets that could make obtaining new sources of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and more costly; and

·

a downgrade in PPL's or its rated subsidiaries' credit ratings that could adversely affect their ability to access capital and increase the cost of credit facilities and any new debt.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 10%, or $181 million in 2010 compared with 2009.  The expiration of the long-term power purchase agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus at the end of 2009 enabled PPL EnergyPlus to sell power at higher market prices and had a positive impact on net income, and specifically on "unregulated gross energy margins" which increased over $600 million, after-tax, in 2010 compared with 2009, and therefore, was the primary driver to the above increase.  The positive impact of additional earnings was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of counterparty collateral received and by additional defined benefit plan contributions.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 17%, or $263 million in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of cash collateral received from counterparties and the benefit of lower income tax payments due to the change in method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2009 compared with 2008.

A significant portion of PPL's operating cash flows is derived from its Supply segment baseload generation business activities.  PPL employs a formal hedging program for its baseload generation fleet, the primary objective of which is to provide a reasonable level of near-term cash flow and earnings certainty while preserving upside potential of power price increases over the medium term.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for further discussion.  Despite its hedging practices, PPL expects its future cash flows from operating activities from its Supply segment to be more influenced by commodity prices than during the past years when long-term supply contracts were in place between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric.  In the near-term, PPL expects its Supply segment operating cash flows to decline
 as a result of lower commodity prices.  PPL expects to see an increase in cash flows from operating activities in the near-term from its Pennsylvania Regulated segment due to its $77.5 million, or 1.6% rate increase that became effective on January 1, 2011.  Finally, the acquisition of LKE (i.e. Kentucky Regulated segment) is expected to provide additional cash flows from operating activities through its regulated rate base that has been added to PPL's portfolio.

PPL's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices.  For example, in addition to limiting its trading ability, if PPL's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment grade" and there was a 10% adverse movement in energy prices, PPL estimates that, based on its December 31, 2010 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of approximately $441 million with respect to electricity and fuel contracts.  PPL has in place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash
 flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating units.

Investing Activities

The primary use of cash in investing activities in 2010 was for the acquisition of LKE.  In 2009 and 2008, the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2010 and projected expenditures for the years 2011 through 2015.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $7.3 billion in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily as a result of $6.8 billion used for the acquisition of LKE.  Net cash used in investing activities also increased, to a lesser extent, due to an increase of $372 million in capital expenditures, a decrease of $154 million from proceeds from the sale of other investments, and a change of $133 million from restricted cash and cash equivalents.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the acquisition of LKE.  The increase in cash used in investing activities from the above items was partially offset by the change in proceeds received from the sale of businesses, which are discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.  PPL received proceeds of $81 million from the sale of the maj
ority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business in 2009, compared to proceeds of $162 million received in 2010 from the sales of the Long Island generation business and the remaining Maine hydroelectric generation business assets.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 46%, or $747 million, in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of a change of $289 million from restricted cash and cash equivalents, a change of $249 million from purchases and sales of other investments, a change of $241 million from purchases and sales of intangible assets and a decrease of $193 million in capital expenditures.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of restricted cash and cash equivalents and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the purchase and sale by a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds issued by the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Energy Supply.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities from the above items was partially offset by the change in proceeds received fr
om the sale of businesses, which are discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.  PPL received $303 million from the sale of the gas and propane businesses in 2008 compared to proceeds of $81 million received from the sale of the majority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business in 2009.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 billion in 2010 compared with $1.3 billion of cash used in financing activities in 2009.  The change from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflects increased issuances of long-term debt and equity related to the acquisition of LKE in 2010, as well as fewer retirements of long-term debt in 2010.

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2009 compared with $721 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2008.  The change from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects fewer issuances and increased retirements of long-term debt in 2009, as well as the net repayment of short-term borrowings in 2009.

In 2010, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $4.7 billion and $2.4 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by common stock dividends paid of $566 million and debt issuance and credit facility costs paid of $175 million.

In 2009, cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of $770 million and common stock dividends paid of $517 million, partially offset by $60 million of common stock sale proceeds.

In 2008, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $1.3 billion and $19 million of common stock sale proceeds, partially offset by common stock dividends paid of $491 million and the repurchase of 802,816 shares of common stock for $38 million.

See "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans to issue debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available to PPL.  Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion of plans to pay dividends on common and preferred securities in the future, as well as maturities of long-term debt.

Forecasted Sources of Cash

PPL expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper program and operating leases.  PPL currently plans to issue up to $750 million in long-term debt securities in 2011, subject to market conditions, in addition to remarketing certain bonds at LG&E to unaffiliated investors as discussed below.  Additionally, PPL's cash flows will include a full year of LKE's cash flows in 2011 and forward.

The borrower under each of these facilities has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of credit are drawn upon.

(b)

Borrowings under LG&E's and KU's credit facilities generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the respective company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  LG&E and KU also each have the capability to request the lenders to issue up to $400 million of letters of credit under its respective facility, which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity.  Additionally, subject to certain conditions, LG&E and KU may each request that its respective facility's capacity be increased by up to $100 million.  Both facilities expire in 2014.

The credit facilities each contain a financial covenant requiring the respective borrower's debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% and other customary covenants.  At December 31, 2010, LG&E's and KU's debt to total capitalization percentages, as calculated in accordance with the credit facilities, were 43% and 41%.  The credit facilities also contain standard representations and warranties that must be made for LG&E or KU to borrow under them.

LG&E repaid its $163 million borrowing in January 2011 with proceeds received from the remarketing of certain tax exempt bonds.

(c)

PPL Energy Supply has the ability to borrow $3.0 billion under its credit facilities.  Such borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  PPL Energy Supply also has the capability to cause the lenders to issue up to $3.5 billion of letters of credit under these facilities, which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity.  Subject to certain conditions, PPL Energy Supply may request that the capacity of one of its facilities be increased by up to $500 million.

These credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65%.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL Energy Supply's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages, as calculated in accordance with its credit facilities, were 44% and 46%.  The credit facilities also contain standard representations and warranties that must be made for PPL Energy Supply to borrow under them.

The committed capacity expires as follows:  $300 million in 2011, $200 million in 2013 and $3.0 billion in 2014.

(d)

Borrowings under PPL Electric's $200 million syndicated credit facility generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior secured long-term debt rating.  PPL Electric also has the capability to request the lenders to issue up to $200 million of letters of credit under this facility, which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity.  Subject to certain conditions, PPL Electric may request that the facility's capacity be increased by up to $100 million.

The syndicated credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70%.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Electric's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentage, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, was 43%.  The syndicated credit facility also contains standard representations and warranties that must be made for PPL Electric to borrow under it.

Committed capacity includes a $150 million credit facility related to an asset-backed commercial paper program through which PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of up to an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution.  At December 31, 2010, based on accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged, $150 million was available for borrowing.

The committed capacity expires as follows:  $150 million in 2011 and $200 million in 2014.  PPL Electric intends to renew its existing $150 million asset-backed credit facility in 2011 in order to maintain its current total committed capacity level.

(e)

The commitments under PPL's domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than 12% of the total committed capacity.

(f)

Borrowings under WPDH Limited's credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's long-term credit rating.  This credit facility contains financial covenants that require WPDH Limited to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and a RAB that exceeds total net debt by the higher of an amount equal to 15% of total net debt or £150 million, in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit facility.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPDH Limited's interest coverage ratios, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were 3.5 and 4.3.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPDH Limited's RAB, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, exceeded its total net debt by £364 million, or 27%, and £325 million, or 25%.

(g)

Borrowings under WPD (South West)'s credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a margin.  This credit facility contains financial covenants that require WPD (South West) to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of RAB, in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit facility.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPD (South West)'s interest coverage ratios, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were 3.6 and 5.3.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPD (South West)'s total net debt, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, was 75% and 67% of RAB.

(h)

The commitments under WPD's credit facilities are provided by eight banks, with no one bank providing more than 25% of the total committed capacity.  The committed capacity under the facilities expires as follows:  £210 million in 2012 and £150 million in 2013.

At December 31, 2010, the unused capacity of WPD's credit facilities was approximately $381 million.

In addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  PPL monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2010, PPL was in material compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL's credit facilities.

Commercial Paper

PPL Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are currently supported by PPL Electric's $200 million syndicated credit facility, which expires in December 2014, based on available capacity.

PPL Electric did not issue any commercial paper during 2010.  Based on its current cash position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Electric currently does not plan to issue any commercial paper during 2011, but it may do so from time to time, subject to market conditions, to facilitate short-term cash flow needs.

Operating Leases

PPL and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through operating leases.  PPL's subsidiaries lease office space, land, buildings and certain equipment.  These leasing structures provide PPL additional operating and financing flexibility.  The operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees.

PPL, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating leases.  These operating leases are not recorded on PPL's Balance Sheets.  The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends.  At this time, PPL believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of other dividend restrictions related to PPL subsidiaries.

See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating leases.

Long-Term Debt and Equity Securities

In January 2011, LG&E remarketed to unaffiliated investors $163 million of tax-exempt bonds issued by Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky on behalf of LG&E.  The proceeds from the remarketing were used for the repayment of short-term debt under its syndicated credit facility.

In addition to the remarketing, PPL and its subsidiaries currently plan to issue up to $750 million in long-term debt securities in 2011, subject to market conditions.  PPL expects to use the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt securities primarily to refund PPL Energy Supply's 2011 debt maturity, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

PPL currently plans to issue new shares of common stock in 2011 in an aggregate amount up to $300 million under various employee stock-based compensation plans and its DRIP.

The Economic Stimulus Package

In April 2010, PPL Electric entered into an agreement with the DOE, in which the agency is to provide funding for one-half of a $38 million smart grid project.  The project would use smart grid technology to strengthen reliability, save energy and improve electric service for 60,000 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area customers.  It would also provide benefits beyond the Harrisburg region, helping to speed power restoration across PPL Electric's 29-county service territory.  Work on the project is progressing on schedule, and PPL Electric is receiving reimbursements under the grant for costs incurred.  The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of September 2012.

Forecasted Uses of Cash

In addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL currently expects to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.

PPL's capital expenditure projections for the years 2011 through 2015 total approximately $15.1 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions.  For the years presented, this table includes projected costs related to the planned 817 MW of incremental capacity increases, PPL Electric's asset optimization program focused on the replacement of aging transmission and distribution assets, the PJM-approved regional transmission line expansion project, and LKE's and Energy Supply's environmental projects related to anticipated new EPA air compliance standards.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the PJM-approved regional transmission line expansion project and the other significant development projects.

PPL plans to fund its capital expenditures in 2011 with cash on hand, cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and debt securities.

Contractual Obligations

PPL has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting its business.  At December 31, 2010, the estimated contractual cash obligations of PPL were:

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the remarketing feature related to the REPS, as well as discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of PPL Energy Supply, LG&E and KU.  PPL does not have any significant capital lease obligations.

(b)

Assumes interest payments through stated maturity, except for the REPS, for which interest is reflected to the put date.  The payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and payments denominated in British pounds sterling have been translated to U.S. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate.

(c)

See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(d)

The payments reflected herein are subject to change, as certain purchase obligations included are estimates based on projected obligated quantities and/or projected pricing under the contracts.  Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented.  The payments also include obligations related to nuclear fuel and the installation of the scrubbers, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

(e)

The amounts reflected represent WPD's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from an actuarial valuation performed in March 2010.  The U.K. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit; however, WPD cannot be certain that this will continue beyond the current review period, which extends to March 31, 2015.  Based on the current funded status of PPL's U.S. qualified pension plans, no cash contributions are required.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected contributions.  The amount also represents currently projected cash flows for LKE's construction commitments.

(f)

At December 31, 2010, total unrecognized tax benefits of $251 million were excluded from this table as PPL cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Dividends

PPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings.  In 2010, PPL increased the annualized dividend rate on its common stock from $1.38 to $1.40 per share, effective with the April 1, 2010 dividend payment.  Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at the time.  As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend on its common stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 
2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or its 4.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018 or until deferred contract adjustment payments on PPL's Purchase Contracts have been paid.  No such deferrals have occurred or are currently anticipated.

PPL Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for PPL subsidiaries.

Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities

PPL will continue to evaluate purchasing or redeeming outstanding debt securities and may decide to take action depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash.

Credit Ratings

Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and preferred securities of PPL and its subsidiaries.  Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues.  The credit ratings of PPL and its subsidiaries are based on information provided by PPL and other sources.  The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL or its subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  A downgrade in PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets.

In prior periodic reports, PPL described its then-current debt ratings in connection with, and to facilitate, an understanding of its liquidity position.  As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the attendant uncertainties relating to the extent to which issuers of non-asset backed securities may disclose credit ratings without being required to obtain rating agency consent to the inclusion of such disclosure, or incorporation by reference of such disclosure, in a registrant's registration statement or section 10(a) prospectus, PPL is limiting its credit rating disclosure to a description of the actions taken by the rating agencies with respect to PPL's ratings, but without stating what ratings have been assigned to PPL or its subsidiaries, or their securities.  The ratings assigned by the rating agencies 
to PPL and its subsidiaries and their respective securities may be found, without charge, on each of the respective ratings agencies' websites, which ratings together with all other information contained on such rating agency websites is hereby explicitly not incorporated by reference in this report.

The rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL and its subsidiaries in 2010.

Moody's

In April 2010, Moody's took the following actions:

·

Revised the outlook for PPL, PPL Capital Funding and PPL Electric;

·

Lowered the issuer rating of PPL and the senior unsecured debt rating of PPL Capital Funding;

·

Lowered the rating of PPL Capital Funding's junior subordinated notes and PPL Electric's preferred securities;

·

Lowered the issuer rating of PPL Electric;

·

Affirmed the senior secured debt rating and commercial paper rating of PPL Electric; and

·

Affirmed the senior unsecured notes rating and the outlook of PPL Energy Supply.

Moody's stated in its press release that the revisions in the ratings for PPL, PPL Capital Funding, and PPL Electric, while reflective of PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE, are driven more by weakening financial metrics and the outlooks that had been in place for PPL and PPL Electric for the past year.

In August 2010, Moody's affirmed all of PPL Energy Supply's ratings.

In October 2010, Moody's affirmed the ratings for PPL and PPL Capital Funding following PPL's receipt of FERC approval of its then-pending acquisition of LKE.

In November 2010, Moody's took the following actions:

·

Assigned a senior unsecured debt rating to LG&E and KU Energy LLC; and

·

Assigned a senior secured debt rating to LG&E and KU.

S&P

In April 2010, S&P took the following actions:

·

Revised the outlook of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Capital Funding;

·

Revised the outlook of WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West); and

·

Affirmed its credit ratings for PPL, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

S&P stated in its press release that the change to the outlook for PPL and PPL Energy Supply considers the greater regulated mix that will result from PPL acquiring LKE, resulting in a pro forma "strong" consolidated business risk profile.  S&P also stated that the revision in the outlook for WPD is a reflection of the change to PPL's outlook and is not a result of any change in WPD's stand-alone credit profile.

In October 2010, S&P took the following actions:

·

Revised the outlook of PPL, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Energy Supply, and PPL Electric;

·

Raised the issuer rating of PPL and PPL Energy Supply;

·

Raised the senior unsecured and junior subordinated debt ratings of PPL Capital Funding;

·

Raised the senior unsecured debt rating of PPL Energy Supply; and

·

Affirmed its credit ratings for PPL Electric.

S&P stated in its press release that the upgrades reflect S&P's opinion of an improved credit profile of the consolidated company following the closing of PPL's then-pending acquisition of LKE.

In November 2010, S&P affirmed its credit rating and revised the outlook for PPL Montana's Pass Through Certificates due 2020.

Also in November 2010, S&P took the following actions:

·

Assigned a senior unsecured debt rating to LG&E and KU Energy LLC; and

·

Assigned a senior secured debt rating to LG&E and KU.

Fitch

In January 2010, as a result of implementing its revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities, Fitch lowered the rating of PPL Capital Funding's junior subordinated notes and lowered the ratings of PPL Electric's preferred stock and preference stock.  Fitch stated in its press release that the new guidelines, which apply to instruments issued by companies in all sectors, typically resulted in downgrades of one notch for many instruments that provide for the ability to defer interest or dividend payments.  Fitch stated that it has no reason to believe that such deferral will be activated.

In April 2010, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings for PPL, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric and retained the outlook for these entities following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE.

In May 2010, Fitch affirmed its rating and issued an outlook for PPL Montana's Pass Through Certificates due 2020.

In October 2010, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings for and revised the outlook of WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

In November 2010, Fitch took the following actions:

·

Assigned an outlook, issuer ratings and senior unsecured debt rating to LG&E and KU Energy LLC; and

·

Assigned an outlook, issuer ratings and senior secured debt rating to LG&E and KU.

Ratings Triggers

As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders back to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's, S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled £1.3 billion (approximately $2.0 billion) at December 31, 2010.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply have various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, tolling agreements, and interest rate and foreign currency instruments, which contain provisions requiring PPL and PPL Energy Supply to post additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's credit rating were to fall below investment grade.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral that would have been required for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2010.  At December 31, 2010, if PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's cre
dit ratings had been below investment grade, PPL would have been required to prepay or post an additional $455 million of collateral to counterparties for both derivative and non-derivative commodity and commodity-related contracts used in its generation, marketing and trading operations and interest rate and foreign currency contracts.

Guarantees for Subsidiaries

PPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

PPL has entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.

Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market Risk

See Notes 1, 18, and 19 to the Financial Statements for information about PPL's risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.

The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)

PPL segregates its non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and economic activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  The economic activity category includes transactions that address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected.  This activity includes the changes in fair value of positions used to hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL's generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities.  This economic activity is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power).  Although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment, these transaction
s are considered non-trading activity.  The net fair value of economic positions at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a net liability of $400 million and $77 million.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on economic activity.

To hedge the impact of market price volatility on PPL's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts.  PPL's non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various times through 2017.

The following table sets forth the net fair value of PPL's non-trading commodity derivative contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The following table segregates the net fair value of PPL's non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 based on whether the fair value was determined by prices quoted in active markets for identical instruments or other more subjective means.

PPL sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward basis to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets.  If PPL were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay liquidating damages.  These damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity.  Depending on price changes in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL's ability to meet its obligations, or cause signi
ficant increases in the market price of replacement energy.  Although PPL attempts to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the future.

Commodity Price Risk (Trading)

PPL's trading contracts mature at various times through 2015.  The following table sets forth changes in the net fair value of PPL's trading commodity derivative contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

VaR Models

PPL utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity price risk in domestic gross energy margins for its non-trading and trading portfolios.  VaR is a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.  PPL calculates VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation technique based on a five-day holding period at a 95% confidence level.  Given the company's conservative hedging program, PPL's non-trading VaR exposure is expected to be limited in the short term.  At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the VaR for PPL's portfolios using end-of-month results for the period was as follows.

The trading portfolio includes all speculative positions, regardless of the delivery period.  All positions not considered speculative are considered non-trading.  PPL's non-trading portfolio includes PPL's entire portfolio, including generation, with delivery periods through the next 12 months.  Both the trading and non-trading VaR computations exclude FTRs due to the absence of reliable spot and forward markets.  The fair value of the non-trading and trading FTR positions was insignificant at December 31, 2010.

Interest Rate Risk

PPL and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk.  PPL utilizes various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.  Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of PPL's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was insignificant.

PPL is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolios.  PPL estimated that a 10% decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2010 would increase the fair value of its debt portfolio by $420 million, compared with $285 million at December 31, 2009.

PPL had the following interest rate hedges outstanding at:

(a)

Includes accrued interest, if applicable.

(b)

Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

(c)

PPL utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments.  These risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing.  While PPL is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of such cash flow hedges are recorded in equity and any changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities.  The changes in fair value of these instruments are then reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates.

(d)

WPDH Limited uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes with maturity dates ranging from December 2017 to December 2028.  While PPL is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any change in the fair value of these instruments is recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in both interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

(e)

PPL utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio.  The change in fair value of these instruments, as well as the offsetting change in the value of the hedged exposure of the debt, is reflected in earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Risk

PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in U.K. affiliates.  In addition, PPL's domestic operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding foreign currency translation.

PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.  In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings.

PPL had the following foreign currency hedges outstanding at:

(a)

Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

(b)

To protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD, PPL executed forward contracts to sell British pounds sterling.  The contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 were settled in January 2011.

(c)

To economically hedge the translation of expected income denominated in British pounds sterling to U.S. dollars, PPL entered into a combination of average rate forwards and average rate options to sell British pounds sterling.  The forwards and options outstanding at December 31, 2010 have termination dates ranging from January 2011 through December 2011.

NDT Funds - Securities Price Risk

In connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear station.  At December 31, 2010, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on PPL's Balance Sheet.  The mix of securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.  However, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates.  PPL actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset alloc
ation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement.  At December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $45 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared with $40 million at December 31, 2009.  See Notes 18 and 23 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the NDT funds.

Defined Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that PPL would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations.  PPL maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and other energy marketing and trading companies.  These concentrations may impact PPL's overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

PPL includes the effect of credit risk on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a counterparty will default when contracts are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint).  In this case, PPL would have to sell into a lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced market.  When necessary, PPL records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not pay for deliveries PPL has made but not yet billed, which are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL has not yet been paid, which is reflected in accounts receivable on the Balance Sheets.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

In 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's post-rate cap plan to procure default electricity supply for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric had contracted for all of the electric supply for customers who elected this service in 2010.

In June 2009, the PUC approved PPL Electric's procurement plan for the period January 2011 through May 2013.  Through 2010, PPL Electric has conducted six of its 14 planned competitive solicitations.

Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit.  In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market.  All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates.  At December 31, 2010, all of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement.  There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.

See "Overview" in this Item 7 and Notes 15, 16, 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the competitive solicitations, the Agreement, credit concentration and credit risk.

Foreign Currency Translation

At December 31, 2010, the British pound sterling had weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $63 million for 2010, which primarily reflected a $180 million reduction to PP&E offset by a reduction of $117 million to net liabilities.  At December 31, 2009, the British pound sterling had strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar as compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $106 million for 2009, which primarily reflected a $225 million increase in PP&E offset by an increase of $119 million to net liabilities.  At December 31, 2008, the British pound sterling had weakened in relation to the U.S. do
llar compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $520 million for 2008, which primarily reflected a $1.1 billion reduction to PP&E offset by a reduction of $580 million to net liabilities.

Related Party Transactions

PPL is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management of PPL, PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with PPL.  See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions.

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures

See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on the acquisition of LKE.

With limited exceptions LKE took care, custody and control of TC2 on January 22, 2011, and has dispatched the unit to meet customer demand since that date.  LG&E and KU and the contractor agreed to a further amendment of the construction agreement whereby the contractor will complete certain actions relating to identifying and completing any necessary modifications to allow operation of TC2 on all fuels in accordance with initial specifications prior to certain dates, and amending the provisions relating to liquidated damages.  LKE cannot currently estimate the ultimate outcome of these matters.  I

n addition, incremental capacity increases of 247 MW are currently planned, primarily at existing generating facilities.  
See "Item 2. Properties" for additional information.

Development projects are continuously reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options.

See Notes 8 and 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the more significant activities.

New Accounting Guidance

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements).  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with PPL's Audit Committee.<
/font>

1)      Price Risk Management

See "Price Risk Management" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements as well as "Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other" above.

2)      Defined Benefits

PPL and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans applicable to the majority of the employees of PPL and its subsidiaries.  PPL and certain of its subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

PPL makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  When accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle.  Annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates.  These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods.  The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit 
under the plans.  The primary assumptions are:

·

Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

·

Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes.  These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs PPL records currently.

·

Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.

·

Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

In selecting a discount rate for its U.S. defined benefit plans, PPL starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.  A portfolio of 604 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of $667 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate assumption.  At December 31, 2010, PPL decreased the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans from 6.00% to 5.42% as a result of this assessment and decreased the discou
nt rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from 5.81% to 5.14%.

A similar process is used to select the discount rate for the U.K. pension plans, which uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base.  At December 31, 2010, the discount rate for the U.K. pension plans was decreased from 5.55% to 5.54% as a result of this assessment.

The expected long-term rates of return for PPL's U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans have been developed using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  PPL management corroborates these rates with expected long-term rates of return calculated by its independent actuary, who uses a building block approach that begins with a risk-free rate of return with factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk.  Each plan's specific asset allocation is also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.

At December 31, 2010, PPL's expected return on plan assets decreased from 8.00% to 7.25% for its U.S. pension plans and decreased from 7.00% to 6.56% for its other postretirement benefit plans.  The expected long-term rates of return for PPL's U.K. pension plans have been developed by PPL management with assistance from an independent actuary using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  For the U.K. plans, PPL's expected return on plan assets decreased from 7.91% to 7.86% at December 31, 2010.

In selecting rates of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2010, PPL's rate of compensation increase changed from 4.75% to 4.88% for its U.S. pension plans and 4.75% to 4.90% for its other postretirement benefit plans.  For the U.K. plans, PPL's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.00% at December 31, 2010.

In selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2010, PPL's health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for 2011, gradually declining to 5.50% for 2019.

A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric.  While the charts below reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric by a similar amount in the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax effects.

At December 31, 2010, defined benefit plan liabilities were as follows.

In 2010, PPL recognized net periodic defined benefit costs charged to operating expense of $102 million.  This amount represents a $32 million increase from 2009.  This increase in expense was primarily attributable to amortization of actuarial losses of the WPD pension plans in the U.K.

3)      Asset Impairment

Impairment analyses are performed for long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable.  For these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are:

·

a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

·

a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition;

·

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;

·

an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

·

a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or

·

a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

For a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.  Management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows, including the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets.  Alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying value of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the "most likely" alternative are 
used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome.  If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives.  For assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets.  That assessment is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.  Changes in assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.

For a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount to its fair value less cost to sell.  A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment previously recognized.

For determining fair value, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are unavailable, PPL considers all valuation techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be obtained.  Generally discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when available.  Discounted cash flows are calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams.

In 2010, impairments of certain long-lived assets were recorded.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain sulfur dioxide emission allowances and certain non-core generation facilities.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.  Reporting units have been determined to be at or one level below operating segments.  A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.  Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.

Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount exceeds the impl
ied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2010, no goodwill was required to be impaired.  Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit.  For the discounted cash flows approach, a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, or an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points, would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill.  For the market multiples approach, which is based on either current or forward trading multiples of comparable companies or precedent transactions, a 10% decrease in the multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill.

In 2010 and 2009, $5 million and $3 million of goodwill allocated to discontinued operations was written off.

4)      Loss Accruals

Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes.  For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured.  Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed.

The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management.  Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are used, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In 2010, a significant adjustment to the contingency accrual related to the Montana hydroelectric streambed litigation was recorded.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual.  Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.

When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual are identified, where applicable.  The triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is paid or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected.

·

Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable.

Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, operation management and other parties.

5)      Asset Retirement Obligations

PPL is required to recognize a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.  The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value.  A conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.  An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.  In the case of LG&E and KU, estimated costs of removal for all assets are recovered in rates as a component of depreciation.  Since costs of removal are coll
ected in rates prior to payment of such costs, the accrual for these costs of removal is classified as a regulatory liability.  The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.  The depreciation and accretion expense related to an ARO is recorded as a regulatory asset.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of AROs.

In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest e
stimate of the ARO.  Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the remeasurement of the ARO for the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear units in the third quarter of 2010, which resulted in a $103 million reduction in the ARO primarily due to a decrease in estimated inflation rates.

At December 31, 2010, AROs totaling $448 million were recorded on the Balance Sheet, of which $13 million is included in "Other current liabilities."  Of the total amount, $270 million, or 60%, relates to the nuclear decommissioning ARO.  The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates.  A variance in any of these inputs could have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The following table reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear decommissioning ARO liability associated with a change in these assumptions as of December 31, 2010.  There is no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of changing the assumptions.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

6)      Income Taxes

Significant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position.  Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of ben
efit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be de-recognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.

At December 31, 2010, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by as much as $28 million or decrease by up to $226 million.  This change could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign taxes, the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.

The balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment.  Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment
 must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position.  Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk (e.g. the potential for legislative extension of generation rate caps) and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances.  The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the release of $72 million of valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carryforwards in 2010.

7)      Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Certain of PPL's subsidiaries are subject to cost-based rate regulation.  As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements.  Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities.  Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to regulated customers for previous collections of costs that are expected to be refunded to customers in the future, or in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on the understanding with the regulator that current rates are being set to recover c
osts that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.

Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.  Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery.  This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, then asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.  Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibilit
y in the manner and timing of the depreciation of PP&E and amortization of regulatory assets.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL had regulatory assets of $1.2 billion and $542

million.  All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL had regulatory liabilities of $1.1 billion and $84 million.  The significant increase in regulatory assets and liabilities was primarily due to the acquisition of LKE in November 2010.

See "Business Combinations – Purchase Price Allocation" below for discussion of regulatory assets established by purchase accounting.  See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities.

8)      Business Combinations – Purchase Price Allocation

On November 1, 2010 (acquisition date), PPL completed the acquisition of all of the limited liability company interests of LKE.  In accordance with accounting guidance on business combinations, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were measured at fair value at the acquisition date.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets was recorded as goodwill.

The determination and allocation of fair value to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on key assumptions of the acquisition, and historical and current market data.  The most significant variables in these valuations were the discount rates, the number of years on which to base cash flow projections, as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine cash inflows and outflows.  Although the assumptions were reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition, actual results may differ from the forecasted amounts and the difference could be material.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of the majority of PP&E and regulatory assets acquired and regulatory liabilities assumed, PPL determined that fair value was equal to net book value at the acquisition date, because LKE's operations are conducted in a regulated environment and the regulatory commissions allow for earning a rate of return on and recovery of the book value of a majority of the regulated asset bases at rates determined to be fair and reasonable.  As there is no current prospect for deregulation in LKE's operating territory, it is expected that these operations will remain in a regulated environment for the foreseeable future; therefore, management has concluded that the use of these assets in the regulatory environment represents their highest and best use and a market participant would measure the fair
 value of these assets using the regulatory rate of return as the discount rate, thus resulting in fair value equal to book value.

The fair value of intangible assets and liabilities (e.g. contracts that have favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market), including coal contracts and power purchase agreements, as well as emission allowances, have been reflected on the balance sheet with offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities.  Prior to the acquisition, LKE recovered in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances and this rate treatment will continue after the acquisition.  As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value adjustments meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate making impact of the fair value adjustments.  LKE's customer rates will continue to reflect these items (e.g.
 coal, purchased power, emission allowances) at their original contracted prices.

PPL also considered whether a separate fair value should be assigned to LKE's rights to operate within its various electric and natural gas distribution service territories but concluded that these rights only provided the opportunity to earn a regulated return and barriers to market entry, which in management's judgment is not considered a separately identifiable intangible asset under applicable accounting guidance; rather, it is considered going-concern value, or goodwill.

Goodwill related to the LKE acquisition of $996 million was recorded at LG&E and KU.  For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the goodwill must be assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition.  Both the Kentucky Regulated and the Supply segments are expected to benefit and the assignment of goodwill was $662 million to the Kentucky Regulated segment and $334 million to the Supply segment.  The goodwill at the Kentucky Regulated segment reflects the expected going-concern element of LKE's existing business.  This going-concern element reflects the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of LKE to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of th
ose growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows.  Although no other assets or liabilities from the acquisition were assigned to the Supply segment, the Supply segment obtained a synergistic benefit attributed to the overall de-risking of the PPL portfolio, which enhanced PPL Energy Supply's credit profile, thereby increasing the value of the Supply segment.  This increase in value resulted in the assignment of goodwill to the Supply segment.

See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition.

PPL ENERGY SUPPLY, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL Energy Supply's Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.  Terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary.  Dollars are in millions unless otherwise noted.

PPL Energy Supply is an energy company with headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets - the northeastern and northwestern U.S. - and, through 2010, in the delivery of electricity in the U.K.  PPL Energy Supply's overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in its regulated international electricity delivery business through efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations.  More specifically, PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its competitive electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load, or customer dema
nd, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy and fuel price volatility, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.  PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its regulated international electricity delivery business is to own and operate this business at the most efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer service and reliability.

In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.  See Note 24 for additional information.  Certain information for periods subsequent to 2010 has been adjusted to eliminate amounts related to PPL Global.

To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL Energy Supply's business is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL Energy Supply continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and liquidity position.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply has adopted financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating units.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks PPL Energy Supply faces in its businesses.

Refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for descriptions of PPL Energy Supply's reportable segments, which are International Regulated (formerly International Delivery) and Supply.  In 2010, there were no changes to these segments other than renaming the International Regulated segment.

"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" provides information concerning PPL Energy Supply's performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

·

"Results of Operations" provides an overview of PPL Energy Supply's operating results in 2010, 2009 and 2008, including a review of earnings, with details of results by reportable segment.  It also provides a brief outlook for 2011.

·

"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" provides an analysis of PPL Energy Supply's liquidity position and credit profile, including its sources of cash (including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow) and uses of cash (including contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements) and the key risks and uncertainties that impact PPL Energy Supply's past and future liquidity position and financial condition.  This subsection also includes rating agency actions on PPL Energy Supply's credit ratings.

·

"Financial Condition - Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other" provides an explanation of PPL Energy Supply's risk management programs relating to market risk and credit risk.

·

"Application of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of PPL Energy Supply and that require its management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments.

See "Item 1. Business - Background - Segment Information - Pennsylvania Regulated Segment" for a discussion of the Customer Choice Act.

When comparing 2010 with 2009, certain line items on PPL Energy Supply's financial statements were impacted by the expiration of the full-requirement energy supply contracts.  Overall, the expiration of generation rate caps had a significant positive impact on PPL Energy Supply's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows during 2010.

The primary impact of the expiration of generation rate caps and this contract is reflected in PPL Energy Supply's unregulated gross energy margins.  See "Statement of Income Analysis" for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.  In 2010, PPL Energy Supply sold the majority of its generation supply under various wholesale and retail contracts at prevailing market rates at the time the contracts were executed.  In 2009, the majority of generation produced by PPL Energy Supply's generation plants was sold to PPL Electric's customers as PLR supply under predetermined capped rates.

See "Regulatory Issues - Enactment of Financial Reform Legislation" in Note 15 for information on the Dodd-Frank Act.

Results of Operations

Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Segment Results" and "Statement of Income Analysis" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained.  Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rate.

The changes in Net Income Attributable to PPL Energy Supply from year to year were, in part, due to several special items that management considers significant.  Details of these special items are provided within the review of each segment's earnings.

The year-to-year changes in significant earnings components, including unregulated gross energy margins by region and significant income statement line items, are explained in the "Statement of Income Analysis."

2011 Outlook

In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.  See Note 24 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Supply Segment

The Supply segment primarily consists of the energy marketing and trading activities, as well as the competitive generation and development operations of PPL Energy Supply.  In September 2010, certain PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries signed definitive agreements to sell their entire ownership interests in certain non-core generation facilities.  The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and third-party consents.  The operating results of these facilities have been classified as Discontinued Operations.  In 2010 and 2009, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries also completed the sale of several businesses, which have been classified as Discontinued Operations.

Other operation and maintenance increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to increased payroll-related costs, higher contractor-related costs and other costs at Susquehanna.  Also contributing to the increase were higher support group costs, higher expenses at western fossil/hydro plants due to the Corette overhaul and lease expense related to the use of the streambeds in Montana.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on continuing litigation regarding the streambeds in Montana.

Other operation and maintenance increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to increased payroll-related costs, higher contractor-related costs and other costs at generation plants.

·

Depreciation increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to the Brunner Island environmental equipment that was placed in service in 2009 and early 2010.

Depreciation increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to the scrubbers at Brunner Island and Montour and portions of the Susquehanna uprate projects that were placed in service in 2008 and 2009.

·

Income taxes decreased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to a release of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets for Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards, investment tax credits at Holtwood and Rainbow, a release of tax reserves in 2010, and a tax benefit from the manufacturing deduction.

Income taxes increased in 2009 compared with 2008, in part due to lower domestic manufacturing deductions in 2009.

This economic activity will continue to be realized through May 2013.

2011 Outlook

Excluding special items, lower earnings are projected from the Supply segment in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of lower energy margins driven by lower energy and capacity prices in the East, higher average fuel costs, and higher operation and maintenance expense.

Earnings beyond 2010 are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

Statement of Income Analysis --

Unregulated Gross Energy Margins

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure, "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins."  "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" is a single financial performance measure of PPL Energy Supply's competitive energy non-trading and trading activities.  In calculating this measure, the Supply segment's energy revenues are offset by the cost of fuel and energy purchases, and adjusted for other related items.  This performance measure is relevant to PPL Energy Supply due to the volatility in the individual revenue and expense lines on the Statements of Income that comprise "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins."  This volatility stems from a number of factors, including the required netting of certain transactions with ISOs and signific
ant swings in unrealized gains and losses.  Such factors could result in gains or losses being recorded in either "Wholesale energy marketing" or "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply excludes from "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" energy-related economic activity, which includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL Energy Supply's competitive generation assets, full-requirement and retail activities.  This economic value is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the delivery period that was hedged.  Also included in this energy-related economic activity is the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges, net losses on the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and premium amortization associated with options.  This economic activity 
is deferred, with the exception of the net losses on the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized, and included in unregulated gross energy margins over the delivery period that was hedged or upon realization.  PPL Energy Supply believes that "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" provides another criterion to make investment decisions.  This performance measure is used, in conjunction with other information, internally by senior management and the Board of Directors of PPL to manage its competitive energy non-trading and trading activities.  PPL's management also uses "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" in measuring certain PPL corporate performance goals used in determining variable compensation.

This measure is not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  Other companies may use different measures to analyze and to report on the results of their operations.  The following table reconciles "Operating Income" to "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" as defined by PPL Energy Supply.

Eastern U.S.

Eastern U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to significantly higher pricing in 2010 for eastern baseload generation compared with prices realized under the PLR contract with PPL Electric that expired at the end of 2009.  Partially offsetting the increase were lower realized margins from full-requirement sales contracts due to lower customer demand and customer migration.

Eastern U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower margins on full-requirement sales contracts resulting from mild weather, decreased demand, and customer migration.  Also contributing to the decrease were higher average baseload generation fuel costs, primarily due to higher coal prices.  Partially offsetting these lower margins were net gains resulting from the settlement of economic positions associated with rebalancing portfolios to better align them with current strategies, higher capacity revenue, higher baseload generation output due to unplanned major outages in 2008, and an increase in the PLR sales prices in accordance with the PUC Final Order.

Western U.S.

Western U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower volumes.

Western U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to higher wholesale volumes and increased generation from the hydroelectric units.

Net Energy Trading

Net energy trading margins decreased in 2010 compared with 2009, consisting of lower trading margins related to power and gas, partially offset by higher trading margins related to FTRs.

Net energy trading margins increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to increased margins in the power, gas and oil trading positions resulting from unrealized trading losses in 2008 due to a dramatic decline in energy prices and a severe contraction of liquidity in the wholesale power markets.

Utility Revenues

For the period 2010 compared to 2009, $21 million relates to lower impairment charges of sulfur dioxide emission allowances.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  Partially offsetting the decrease was a $5 million increase in the charge for the settlement of a dispute regarding the sale of certain annual nitrogen oxide allowance put options.

For the period 2009 compared to 2008, $33 million relates to lower impairment charges of nitrogen oxide allowances partially offset by $37 million of higher impairment charges of sulfur dioxide allowances.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  Also contributing to the difference was a $13 million decrease in the charge for the settlement of a dispute regarding the sale of certain annual nitrogen oxide allowance put options.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

Other-than-temporary impairments decreased by $15 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and by $18 million in 2009 compared with 2008.  The decrease for both periods was primarily due to stronger returns on NDT investments caused by improved market conditions within the financial markets.

Interest Income from Affiliates

Interest income from affiliates increased by $7 million in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to loans to LKE subsidiaries, which have been fully repaid as of December 31, 2010.

Interest income from affiliates decreased by $12 million in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to the decline in the average balance outstanding and the floating interest rate on the collateral deposit related to the PLR contract.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

PPL Energy Supply expects to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and its credit facilities.  Additionally, subject to market conditions, PPL Energy Supply currently plans to access debt capital markets in 2011.

PPL Energy Supply's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to:

·

changes in market prices for electricity;

·

changes in commodity prices that may increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount PPL Energy Supply receives from selling power;

·

operational and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale power markets;

·

potential ineffectiveness of the trading, marketing and risk management policy and programs used to mitigate PPL Energy Supply's risk exposure to adverse electricity and fuel prices, interest rates and counterparty credit;

·

reliance on transmission and distribution facilities that PPL Energy Supply does not own or control to deliver its electricity and natural gas;

·

unavailability of generating units (due to unscheduled or longer-than-anticipated generation outages, weather and natural disasters) and the resulting loss of revenues and additional costs of replacement electricity;

·

costs of compliance with existing and new environmental laws and with new security and safety requirements for nuclear facilities;

·

any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations with respect to PPL Energy Supply's current and past business activities;

·

deterioration in the financial markets that could make obtaining new sources of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and more costly; and

·

a downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or its rated subsidiaries' credit ratings that could adversely affect their ability to access capital and increase the cost of credit facilities and any new debt.

See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further discussion of risks and uncertainties affecting PPL Energy Supply's cash flows.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 30%, or $427 million, in 2010 compared with 2009.  The expiration of the long-term power purchase agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus at the end of 2009 enabled PPL EnergyPlus to sell power at higher market prices and had a positive impact on net income, and specifically on "unregulated gross energy margins" which increased over $600 million, after-tax, in 2010 compared with 2009, and therefore, was the primary driver to the above increase.  The positive impact of additional earnings was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of counterparty collateral received and by additional defined benefit plan contributions.  In addition, changes in working capital in 2010 compared with 2009 offset the $300 million impact of cash collateral rec
eived from PPL Electric in 2009 as discussed below.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 36%, or $374 million, in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of the return of $300 million in cash collateral from PPL Electric related to the long-term PLR energy supply agreements (which expired at the end of 2009); cash collateral received from counterparties; and the benefit of lower income tax payments due to the change in method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2009 compared with 2008.

A significant portion of PPL Energy Supply's operating cash flows is derived from its Supply segment baseload generation business activities.  PPL Energy Supply employs a formal hedging program for its baseload generation fleet, the primary objective of which is to provide a reasonable level of near-term cash flow and earnings certainty while preserving upside potential of power price increases over the medium term.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for further discussion.  Despite its hedging practices, PPL Energy Supply expects its future cash flows to be more influenced by commodity prices than during the past years when long-term supply contracts were in place between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric. In the near-term, PPL Energy Supply expects its Supply segment operating cash flows to decline as a
 result of lower commodity prices.  In addition, in January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.  See Note 24 to the Financial Statements for additional information.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply's cash from operating activities will also decline in future periods, as compared with prior periods.

PPL Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices.  For example, in addition to limiting its trading ability, if PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's ratings were lowered to below "investment grade" and there was a 10% adverse movement in energy prices, PPL Energy Supply estimates that, based on its December 31, 2010 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of approximately $348 million with respect to electricity and fuel contracts.  PPL Energy Supply has in place risk management programs that a
re designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating units.

Investing Activities

The primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2010 and projected expenditures for the years 2011 through 2015.

Net cash used in investing activities increased 50%, or $274 million in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease of $154 million from proceeds from the sale of other investments, a change of $135 million from restricted cash and cash equivalents, and an increase of $102 million in capital expenditures.  The increase in cash used in investing activities from the above items was partially offset by the change in proceeds received from the sale of businesses, which are discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements and a change of $28 million in other investing activities.  PPL Energy Supply received proceeds of $81 million from the sale of the majority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business in 2009, compared to proceeds of $162 million received in 2010 from the sales of the Long Island genera
tion business and the remaining Maine hydroelectric generation business assets.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased 68%, or $1.1 billion in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of a change of $371 million from restricted cash and cash equivalents, a change of $249 million from purchases and sales of other investments, a change of $244 million from purchases and sales of intangible assets, a decrease of $207 million in capital expenditures and $81 million of proceeds received in 2009 from the sale of the majority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of restricted cash and cash equivalents and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the purchase and sale by a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply of Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds issued by the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Energy Supply and Note 9 to the Financia
l Statements for a discussion of the sale of the majority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $612 million in 2010 compared with $1.1 billion in 2009 and net cash provided by financing activities of $779 million in 2008.  The change from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflects more long-term debt issuances, increased contributions from and distributions to Member, and less short-term borrowings in 2010.  The change from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects no issuances of long-term debt in 2009, reduced contributions from Member, increased distributions to Member and less short-term borrowings in 2009.

In 2010, cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $4.7 billion in distributions to Member, partially offset by $3.6 billion in contributions from Member and net debt issuances of $509 million.  The distributions to and contributions from Member during 2010 primarily relate to the funds received by PPL in June 2010 from the issuance of common stock and Equity Units.  These funds were invested by a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply until they were returned to its Member in October 2010 to be available to partially fund the acquisition of LKE and pay certain acquisition-related fees and expenses.

In 2009, cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $943 million in distributions to Member and net debt retirements of $177 million, partially offset by $50 million in contributions from Member.

In 2008, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $1.1 billion and $421 million in contributions from Member, partially offset by $750 million in distributions to Member.

Forecasted Sources of Cash

PPL Energy Supply expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near term, including various credit facilities, operating leases and contributions from Member.  Additionally, PPL Energy Supply expects to have access to debt capital markets and currently plans to issue up to $500 million in long-term debt securities in 2011, subject to market conditions.

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2010, PPL Energy Supply's total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

(a)

The borrower under each of these facilities has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of credit are drawn upon.

(b)

PPL Energy Supply has the ability to borrow $3.0 billion under its credit facilities.  Such borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  PPL Energy Supply also has the capability to cause the lenders to issue up to $3.5 billion of letters of credit under these facilities, which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity.  Subject to certain conditions, PPL Energy Supply may request that the capacity of one of its facilities be increased by up to $500 million.

These credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65%.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL Energy Supply's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages, as calculated in accordance with its credit facilities, were 44% and 46%.  The credit facilities also contain standard representations and warranties that must be made for PPL Energy Supply to borrow under them.

The commitments under PPL Energy Supply's domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than 14% of the total committed capacity.  The committed capacity expires as follows:  $300 million in 2011, $200 million in 2013 and $3.0 billion in 2014.

(c)

Borrowings under WPDH Limited's credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's public long-term credit rating.  This credit facility contains financial covenants that require WPDH Limited to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and a RAB that exceeds total net debt by the higher of an amount equal to 15% of total net debt or £150 million, in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit facility.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPDH Limited's interest coverage ratios, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were 3.5 and 4.3.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPDH Limited's RAB, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, exceeded its total net debt by £364 million, or 27%, and £325 million, or
 25%.

(d)

Borrowings under WPD (South West)'s credit facility bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a margin.  This credit facility contains financial covenants that require WPD (South West) to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of RAB, in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit facility.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPD (South West)'s interest coverage ratios, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were 3.6 and 5.3.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, WPD (South West)'s total net debt, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, was 75% and 67% of RAB.

(e)

The commitments under WPD's credit facilities are provided by eight banks, with no one bank providing more than 25% of the total committed capacity.  The committed capacity under the facilities expires as follows:  £210 million in 2012 and £150 million in 2013.

At December 31, 2010, the unused capacity of WPD's credit facilities was approximately $381 million.

In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its 100% membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding.  See Note 24 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

In addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  PPL Energy Supply monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Energy Supply was in material compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL Energy Supply's credit facilities.

Operating Leases

PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through operating leases.  PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries lease office space, land, buildings and certain equipment.  These leasing structures provide PPL Energy Supply additional operating and financing flexibility.  The operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees.

PPL Energy Supply, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating leases.  These operating leases are not recorded on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets.  The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases.

See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating leases.

Long-Term Debt Securities and Contributions from Member

Subject to market conditions, PPL Energy Supply currently plans to issue up to $500 million in long-term debt securities in 2011.  PPL Energy Supply expects to use the proceeds from this issuance primarily to refund PPL Energy Supply's 2011 debt maturity.

From time to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Energy Supply's Member, PPL Energy Funding, makes capital contributions to PPL Energy Supply.  PPL Energy Supply uses these contributions for general corporate purposes.

Forecasted Uses of Cash

In addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL Energy Supply currently expects to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, distributions to its Member and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of its debt securities.

Capital Expenditures

The table below shows PPL Energy Supply's actual spending for the year 2010 and current capital expenditure projections for the years 2011 through 2015.

Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions.  This table includes projected costs related to the planned 247 MW of incremental capacity increases.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information regarding the significant development projects.

PPL Energy Supply plans to fund its capital expenditures in 2011 with cash on hand and cash from operations.

Contractual Obligations

PPL Energy Supply has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting its business.  At December 31, 2010, the estimated contractual cash obligations of PPL Energy Supply were:  (Amounts related to PPL Global have been excluded for periods subsequent to 2010.

Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented.  The payments also include obligations related to nuclear fuel and the installation of the scrubbers, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

At December 31, 2010, total unrecognized tax benefits of $183 million were excluded from this table as PPL Energy Supply cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Distributions to Member

From time to time, as determined by its Board of Managers, PPL Energy Supply makes return of capital distributions to its Member.

Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities

PPL Energy Supply will continue to evaluate purchasing or redeeming outstanding debt securities and may decide to take action depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash.

Credit Ratings

Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt securities of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries.  Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues.  The credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries are based on information provided by PPL Energy Supply and other sources.  The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  A downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets.

In prior periodic reports, PPL Energy Supply described its then-current debt ratings in connection with, and to facilitate, an understanding of its liquidity position.  As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the attendant uncertainties relating to the extent to which issuers of non-asset backed securities may disclose credit ratings without being required to obtain rating agency consent to the inclusion of such disclosure, or incorporation by reference of such disclosure, in a registrant's registration statement or section 10(a) prospectus, PPL Energy Supply is limiting its credit rating disclosure to a description of the actions taken by the rating agencies with respect to PPL Energy Supply's ratings, but without stating what ratings have been assigned to PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries, or their securities.
  The ratings assigned by the rating agencies to PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries and their respective securities may be found, without charge, on each of the respective ratings agencies' websites, which ratings together with all other information contained on such rating agency websites is, hereby, explicitly not incorporated by reference in this report.

The rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries in 2010.

Moody's

Following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE, Moody's affirmed its senior unsecured notes credit rating and outlook for PPL Energy Supply in April 2010.

In August 2010, Moody's affirmed all of PPL Energy Supply's ratings.

S&P

Following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE, S&P took the following actions in April 2010:

·

Revised the outlook of PPL Energy Supply;

·

Revised the outlook of WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West); and

·

Affirmed its credit ratings for PPL Energy Supply, WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

S&P stated in its press release that the change to the outlook for PPL Energy Supply considers the greater regulated mix that will result from PPL acquiring LKE, resulting in a pro forma "strong" consolidated business risk profile for PPL.  S&P also stated that the revision in the outlook for WPD is a reflection of the change to PPL's outlook and is not a result of any change in WPD's stand-alone credit profile.

In October 2010, S&P took the following actions:

·

Revised the outlook of PPL Energy Supply;

·

Raised the issuer rating of PPL Energy Supply; and

·

Raised the senior unsecured debt rating of PPL Energy Supply.

In November 2010, S&P affirmed its credit rating and revised the outlook for PPL Montana's Pass Through Certificates due 2020.

Fitch

Following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and outlook for PPL Energy Supply in April 2010.

In May 2010, Fitch affirmed its rating and issued an outlook for PPL Montana's Pass Through Certificates due 2020.

In October 2010, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings for and revised the outlook of WPDH Limited, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West).

Ratings Triggers

As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders back to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's, S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled £1.3 billion (approximately $2.0 billion) at December 31, 2010.

PPL Energy Supply has various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, tolling agreements, and interest rate and foreign currency instruments, which contain provisions requiring PPL Energy Supply to post additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL Energy Supply's credit rating were to fall below investment grade.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral that would have been required for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2010.  At December 31, 2010, if PPL Energy Supply's credit rating had been below investment
 grade, PPL Energy Supply would have been required to prepay or post an additional $347 million of collateral to counterparties for both derivative and non-derivative commodity and commodity-related contracts used in its generation, marketing and trading operations and interest rate and foreign currency contracts.

Guarantees for Subsidiaries

PPL Energy Supply guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

PPL Energy Supply has entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.

Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market Risk

See Notes 1, 18, and 19 to the Financial Statements for information about PPL Energy Supply's risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.

The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.

Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)

PPL Energy Supply segregates its non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and economic activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  The economic activity category includes transactions that address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected.  This activity includes the changes in fair value of positions used to hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL Energy Supply's generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities.  This economic activity is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power).  Although they do not receive hedge accounting 
treatment, these transactions are considered non-trading activity.  (See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on hedge and economic activity).  The net fair value of economic positions at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a net liability of $389 million and $77 million.

To hedge the impact of market price volatility on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL Energy Supply sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts.  PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various times through 2017.

The following table sets forth the net fair value of PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The following table segregates the net fair value of PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 based on whether the fair value was determined by prices quoted in active markets for identical instruments or other more subjective means.

PPL Energy Supply sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward basis to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets.  If PPL Energy Supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay liquidating damages.  These damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity.  Depending on price changes in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL Energy Supply's abili
ty to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy.  Although PPL Energy Supply attempts to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the future.

Commodity Price Risk (Trading)

PPL Energy Supply's trading contracts mature at various times through 2015.  The following table sets forth changes in the net fair value of PPL Energy Supply's trading commodity derivative contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Energy Supply will reverse unrealized gains of approximately $2 million over the next three months as the transactions are realized.

The following table segregates the net fair value of PPL Energy Supply's trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 based on whether the fair value was determined by prices quoted in active markets for identical instruments or other more subjective means.

VaR Models

PPL Energy Supply utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity price risk in domestic gross energy margins for its non-trading and trading portfolios.  VaR is a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.  PPL Energy Supply calculates VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation technique based on a five-day holding period at a 95% confidence level.  Given the company's conservative hedging program, PPL's non-trading VaR exposure is expected to be limited in the short term.  At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the VaR for PPL Energy Supply's portfolios using end-of-month results for the period was as follows.

The trading portfolio includes all speculative positions, regardless of the delivery period.  All positions not considered speculative are considered non-trading.  PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio includes PPL Energy Supply's entire portfolio, including generation, with delivery periods through the next 12 months.  Both the trading and non-trading VaR computations exclude FTRs due to the absence of reliable spot and forward markets.  The fair value of the non-trading and trading FTR positions was insignificant at December 31, 2010.

Interest Rate Risk

PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.  Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL Energy Supply's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was not significant.

PPL Energy Supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolios.  PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2010 would increase the fair value of its debt portfolio by $198 million, compared with $187 million at December 31, 2009.

PPL Energy Supply had the following interest rate hedges outstanding at:

(a)

Includes accrued interest, if applicable.

(b)

Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

(c)

PPL and PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce PPL Energy Supply's exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of PPL Energy Supply's debt instruments.  These risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates.

(d)

WPDH Limited uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes with maturity dates ranging from December 2017 to December 2028.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any change in the fair value of these instruments is recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in both interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

(e)

PPL and PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio.  The change in fair value of these instruments, as well as the offsetting change in the value of the hedged exposure of the debt, is reflected in earnings.  Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Risk

PPL Energy Supply is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in U.K. affiliates.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply's domestic operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding foreign currency translation.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply have adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings.

PPL Energy Supply had the following foreign currency hedges outstanding at:

(a)

Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

(b)

To protect the value of a portion of PPL Energy Supply's net investment in WPD, PPL executed forward contracts to sell British pounds sterling.  The contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 were settled in January 2011.

(c)

To economically hedge the translation of expected income denominated in British pounds sterling to U.S. dollars, PPL entered into a combination of average rate forwards and average rate options to sell British pounds sterling.  The forwards and options outstanding at December 31, 2010 have termination dates ranging from January 2011 through December 2011.

NDT Funds - Securities Price Risk

In connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear station.  At December 31, 2010, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheet.  The mix of securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.  However, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates.  PPL actively monitors the investment performance and periodically revie
ws asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement.  At December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $45 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared with $40 million at December 31, 2009.  See Notes 18 and 23 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the NDT funds.

Defined Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that PPL Energy Supply would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations.  PPL Energy Supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL Energy Supply has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and other energy marketing and trading companies.  These concentrations may impact PPL Energy Supply's overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, r
egulatory or other conditions.

PPL Energy Supply includes the effect of credit risk on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a counterparty will default when contracts are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint).  In this case, PPL Energy Supply would have to sell into a lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced market.  When necessary, PPL Energy Supply records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not pay for deliveries PPL Energy Supply has made but not yet billed, which are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL Energy Supply also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL Energy Supply has not yet been paid, which is reflected in accounts receivable on the Balance Sheets
.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

See "Overview" in this Item 7 and Notes 16, 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit concentration and credit risk.

Foreign Currency Translation

At December 31, 2010, the British pound sterling had weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $63 million for 2010, which primarily reflected a $180 million reduction to PP&E offset by a reduction of $117 million to net liabilities.  At December 31, 2009, the British pound sterling had strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar as compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $106 million for 2009, which primarily reflected a $225 million increase in PP&E offset by an increase of $119 million to net liabilities.  At December 31, 2008, the British pound sterling had weakened in relation to the U.S. do
llar compared with the prior year end.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $520 million for 2008, which primarily reflected a $1.1 billion reduction to PP&E offset by a reduction of $580 million to net liabilities.

New Accounting Guidance

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements).  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with PPL's Audit Committee.<

1)      Price Risk Management

See "Price Risk Management" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements as well as "Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other" above.

2)      Defined Benefits

PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and participate in and are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic defined benefit costs of plans sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply make certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  When accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle.  Annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in OCI.  These amounts in AOCI are amortized to income over future periods.  The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The primary assumptions are:

·

Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

·

Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes.  These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs PPL records currently.

·

Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.

·

Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

In selecting a discount rate for its U.S. defined benefit plans, PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply start with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.  A portfolio of 604 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of $667 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate assumption.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply decreased the discount rate for their U.S. pension plans from 6.00%
 to 5.41% and 5.47%, respectively, as a result of this assessment.  PPL Services decreased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from 5.81% to 5.16% and PPL Energy Supply decreased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from 5.55% to 4.95%.

A similar process is used to select the discount rate for the U.K. pension plans, which uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base.  At December 31, 2010, the discount rate for the U.K. pension plans was decreased from 5.55% to 5.54% as a result of this assessment.

The expected long-term rates of return for PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply's U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans have been developed using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  PPL management corroborates these rates with expected long-term rates of return calculated by its independent actuary, who uses a building block approach that begins with a risk-free rate of return with factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk.  Each plan's specific asset allocation is also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.

At December 31, 2010, PPL Services' expected return on plan assets decreased from 8.00% to 7.25% for its U.S. pension plans and decreased from 7.00% to 6.45% for PPL's other postretirement benefit plans.  The expected long-term rates of return for PPL and PPL Energy Supply's U.K. pension plans have been developed by PPL management with assistance from an independent actuary using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  For the U.K. plans, PPL and PPL Energy Supply's expected return on plan assets decreased from 7.91% to 7.86% at December 31, 2010.

In selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL Energy Supply considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for their U.S. plans.  For the U.K. plans, PPL and PPL Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.00% at December 31, 2010.

In selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL Services and PPL Energy Supply consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services' and PPL Energy Supply's health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for 2011, gradually declining to 5.50% for 2019.

A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and OCI.  While the charts below reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax effects.

At December 31, 2010, defined benefit plan liabilities were as follows.

In 2010, PPL Energy Supply was allocated and recognized net periodic defined benefit costs charged to operating expense of $52 million.  This amount represents a $29 million increase from 2009.  This increase in expense was primarily attributable to amortization of actuarial losses of the WPD pension plans in the U.K.

Asset Impairment

Impairment analyses are performed for long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable.  For these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are:

·

a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

·

a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition;

·

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;

·

an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

·

a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or

·

a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

For a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.  Management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows, including the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets.  Alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying value of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the "most likely" alternative are 
used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome.  If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives.  For assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets.  That assessment is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.  Changes in assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.

For a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount to its fair value less cost to sell.  A gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment previously recognized.

For determining fair value, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are unavailable, PPL considers all valuation techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be obtained.  Generally discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when available.  Discounted cash flows are calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams.

In 2010, impairments of certain long-lived assets were recorded.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain sulfur dioxide emission allowances and certain non-core generation facilities.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.  Reporting units have been determined to be at or one level below operating segments.  A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.  Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.

Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount exceeds the impl
ied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2010, no goodwill was required to be impaired.  Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit.  For the discounted cash flows approach, a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, or an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points, would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill.  For the market multiples approach, which is based on either current or forward trading multiples of comparable companies or precedent transactions, a 10% decrease in the multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill.

In 2010 and 2009, $5 million and $3 million of goodwill allocated to discontinued operations was written off.

4)      Loss Accruals

Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes.  For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured.  Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed.

The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management.  Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are used, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In 2010, a significant adjustment to the contingency accrual related to the Montana hydroelectric streambed litigation was recorded.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual.  Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.

When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual are identified, where applicable.  The triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is paid or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected.

·

Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable.

Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, operation management and other parties.

5)      Asset Retirement Obligations

PPL Energy Supply is required to recognize a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.  The initial obligation should be measured at its estimated fair value.  A conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.  An equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of AROs.

In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest e
stimate of the ARO.  Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the remeasurement of the ARO for the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear units in the third quarter of 2010, which resulted in a $103 million reduction in the ARO primarily due to a decrease in estimated inflation rates.

At December 31, 2010, AROs totaling $345 million were recorded on the Balance Sheet, of which $13 million is included in "Other current liabilities."  Of the total amount, $270 million, or 78%, relates to the nuclear decommissioning ARO.  The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates.  A variance in any of these inputs could have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The following table reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear decommissioning ARO liability associated with a change in these assumptions as of December 31, 2010.  There is no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of changing the assumptions.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

6)      Income Taxes

Significant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position.  Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of ben
efit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be de-recognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.

At December 31, 2010, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by as much as $1 million or decrease by up to $181 million.  This change could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign taxes, the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.

The balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment.  Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment
 must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position.  Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk (e.g. the potential for legislative extension of generation rate caps) and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances.  The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the release of $52 million of valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carryforwards in 2010.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL Electric's Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.  Terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary.  Dollars are in millions unless otherwise noted.

PPL Electric is an electricity delivery service provider in eastern and central Pennsylvania with headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for a description of its business.  PPL Electric's strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery business at the most efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer service and reliability.  Because PPL Electric's electricity delivery business is rate-regulated, it is subject to regulatory risk with respect to costs that may be recovered and investment returns that may be collected through customer rates.

To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL Electric's business is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL Electric continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and liquidity position.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks PPL Electric faces in its business.

"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" provides information concerning PPL Electric's performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

·

"Results of Operations" provides an overview of PPL Electric's operating results in 2010, 2009 and 2008, including a review of earnings.  It also provides a brief outlook for 2011.

·

"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" provides an analysis of PPL Electric's liquidity position and credit profile, including its sources of cash (including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow) and uses of cash (including contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements) and the key risks and uncertainties that impact PPL Electric's past and future liquidity position and financial condition.  This subsection also includes rating agency actions on PPL Electric's credit ratings.

·

"Financial Condition - Risk Management" provides an explanation of PPL Electric's risk management programs relating to market risk and credit risk.

·

"Application of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of PPL Electric and that require its management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments.

See "Item 1. Business - Background - Segment Information - Pennsylvania Regulated Segment" for a discussion of PPL Electric's PLR obligations, PPL Electric's agreement to provide electricity as a PLR at "capped" rates through the end of 2009, and plans for default electricity supply procurement after 2009.

When comparing 2010 with 2009, certain line items on PPL Electric's financial statements were impacted by the Customer Choice Act, Act 129 and other related issues.  The expiration of generation rate caps, the resulting competitive solicitations for power supply, the migration of customers to alternative suppliers, the Customer Choice Act and Act 129 had minimal impact on Pennsylvania gross delivery margins, as approved recovery mechanisms allow for cost recovery of associated expenses, including the cost of energy provided as a PLR.  However, PPL Electric's 2010 Pennsylvania gross delivery margins were negatively impacted by the expiration of CTC recovery in December 2009.  PPL Electric continues to remain the delivery provider for all customers in its service territory and charge a regulated rate for the se
rvice of delivering electricity.

See "Statement of Income Analysis - Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" for additional information.

The after-tax changes in Net Income Available to PPL Corporation between these periods were due to the following factors, including several special items that management considers significant.  Details of these special items are provided below.

See "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins by Component" in the "Statement of Income Analysis" section for an explanation of margins generated by the regulated electric delivery operations.

·

Other operation and maintenance increased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher payroll-related costs and higher contractor costs related to vegetation management.

·

Interest expense decreased in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to lower average debt balances in 2010 compared with 2009 and the interest related to the over-recovery of recoverable transition costs.

Interest expense increased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to $400 million of debt issuances in October 2008 that prefunded a portion of August 2009 debt maturities.

2011 Outlook

Excluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher distribution revenues resulting from an approved distribution base rate increase effective January 1, 2011.

Earnings beyond 2010 are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.  See "Item 1.

Statement of Income Analysis --

Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure, "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins."  "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of PPL Electric's Pennsylvania regulated electric delivery operations, which includes transmission and distribution activities, including PLR supply.  In calculating this measure, Pennsylvania regulated utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset.  These mechanisms allow for full cost recovery of certain expenses; therefore, certain expenses and revenues offset with minimal impact on earnings.  As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from PPL Electric's Pennsylv
ania regulated electric delivery operations.  This performance measure is used, in conjunction with other information, internally by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage its Pennsylvania regulated electric delivery operations.  PPL Electric believes that "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" provides another criterion to make investment decisions.

This measure is not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  Other companies may use different measures to analyze and to report on the results of their operations.  The following table reconciles "Operating Income" to "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" as defined by PPL Electric.

Distribution

The decrease in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to margins realized in 2009 related to the collection of CTC, which ended in December 2009, partially offset by favorable recovery mechanisms for certain energy related costs.

The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower CTC/ITC margins in 2009, ITC collections ended in 2008.  Lower margins were also attributable to unfavorable economic conditions, including industrial customers scaling back on production.  In addition, weather had an unfavorable impact on sales volumes, offset by favorable price increases.

Transmission

The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to increased investment in rate base, an increase in the cost of capital due to an increase in equity and the recovery of additional costs through FERC formula-based rates.

Other Operation and Maintenance

The changes in other operation and maintenance expenses were due to:

(a)

Relates to costs associated with a PUC-approved energy efficiency and conservation plan.  These costs are recovered in customer rates.  See "Regulatory Issues - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on this plan.  These costs are included in "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" above.

(b)

In 2010, PPL Electric increased its vegetation management around its 230- and 500-kV major transmission lines in response to federal reliability requirements for transmission vegetation management.  See "Regulatory Issues - Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Reliability Standards" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(c)

Prior to 2010, these charges were assessed to load serving entities (LSE), and PPL Electric was considered the LSE.  In 2010, PPL Electric was not billed directly for these charges.  The individual PLR generation suppliers incurred these costs and billed PPL Electric as part of the bundled price of PLR supply.  Such costs are reflected in energy purchases.

Taxes, Other Than Income

Taxes, other than income decreased by $56 million in 2010 compared with 2009.  The decrease was primarily due to lower Pennsylvania gross receipts tax expense due to a decrease in electricity revenue as customers chose alternate suppliers in 2010.

Taxes, other than income decreased by $9 million in 2009 compared with 2008.  The decrease was primarily due to a $12 million decrease in Pennsylvania gross receipts tax expense, which reflects a decrease in the tax rate in 2009.

Depreciation

Depreciation increased by $8 million in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to PP&E additions.

Other Income (Expense) - net

See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for details.

Interest Income from Affiliate

Interest income from affiliate decreased by $5 million in 2009 compared with 2008.  This decrease was the result of a reduced average balance outstanding on a note receivable from an affiliate and a lower average rate on this note due to a floating interest rate.

Financing Costs

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

PPL Electric continues to focus on maintaining a strong credit profile and liquidity position.  PPL Electric expects to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and its credit facilities.  Additionally, PPL Electric currently plans to access debt capital markets in 2011, subject to market conditions.

PPL Electric's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to:

·

unusual or extreme weather that may damage PPL Electric's transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers;

·

the ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses;

·

any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations with respect to PPL Electric's current and past business activities;

·

deterioration in the financial markets that could make obtaining new sources of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and more costly; and

·

a downgrade in PPL Electric's credit ratings that could adversely affect its ability to access capital and increase the cost of credit facilities and any new debt.

See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further discussion of risks and uncertainties affecting PPL Electric's cash flows.

At December 31, PPL Electric had the following:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 28%, or $82 million, in 2010 compared with 2009.  The expiration of the generation rate caps at the end of 2009 had little impact on net income, while increased transmission revenue was almost completely offset by decreased distribution revenue.  However, higher tree trimming and payroll costs and additional defined benefit plan contributions were the primary drivers to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities.  Also impacting the 2010 operating cash flows was the elimination of the CTC charge of approximately $300 million that was received in 2009.  This amount offsets the benefit of not paying the $300 million in cash collateral to PPL Energy Supply, as discussed below.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 55%, or $354 million, in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of the repayment by PPL Electric of $300 million in cash collateral related to the long-term PLR energy supply agreements with PPL Energy Supply, which expired at the end of 2009.  The decrease also reflects the impact of lower delivery revenues and higher payments of interest and income taxes.

PPL Electric expects an increase in cash flows from operations in the near-term from its $77.5 million, or 1.6%, rate increase that became effective on January 1, 2011.

Investing Activities

The primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2010 and projected expenditures for the years 2011 through 2015.

Net cash used in investing activities was $403 million in 2010 compared with cash provided by investing activities of $6 million in 2009.  The change from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflects an increase of $113 million in capital expenditures in 2010 and the receipt of $300 million from an affiliate as repayment of a demand loan in 2009.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $6 million in 2009 compared with cash used in investing activities of $226 million in 2008.  The change from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects the receipt of $300 million from an affiliate as repayment of a demand loan.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $90 million in 2010 compared with $298 million in 2009.  The change from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflects no debt activity, decreased contributions from and common stock dividends paid to PPL, and the redemption of preferred stock in 2010.  PPL Electric had net debt retirements of $392 million in 2009 compared with no activity in 2010, received $345 million less of contributions from PPL in 2010 compared to 2009, paid $203 million less of common stock dividends to PPL in 2010 compared to 2009, and paid $54 million to redeem preferred stock in 2010.

Net cash used in financing activities was $298 million in 2009 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $28 million in 2008.  The change from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflects less issuances and increased retirements of long-term debt, contributions received from PPL, increased common stock dividends to PPL and the repayment of short-term borrowings in 2009.  PPL Electric had net debt retirements of $392 million in 2009 compared with net debt issuances of $148 million in 2008, received $400 million of contributions from PPL in 2009 and paid $176 million more of common stock dividends to PPL in 2009 compared to 2008.

See "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans to issue debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available to PPL Electric.  Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred securities, as well as maturities of PPL Electric's long-term debt.

Forecasted Sources of Cash

PPL Electric expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near term, including various credit facilities and a commercial paper program.  PPL Electric currently plans to issue up to $250 million in long-term debt securities in 2011, subject to market conditions.

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2010, PPL Electric's total committed borrowing capacity under its credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

(a)

PPL Electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of credit are drawn upon.

(b)

Borrowings under PPL Electric's syndicated credit facility generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior secured long-term debt rating.  PPL Electric also has the capability to request the lenders to issue up to $200 million of letters of credit under this facility, which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity.  Subject to certain conditions, PPL Electric may request that the facility's capacity be increased by up to $100 million.

This syndicated credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70%.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Electric's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, was 43%.  The syndicated credit facility also contains standard representations and warranties that must be made for PPL Electric to borrow under it.

The commitments under the credit facility are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than 6% of the total committed capacity.

(c)

This credit facility relates to an asset-backed commercial paper program through which PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of up to an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution.  At December 31, 2010, based on accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged, $150 million was available for borrowing.

(d)

The committed capacity expires as follows:  $150 million in 2011 and $200 million in 2014.  PPL Electric intends to renew its existing $150 million asset-backed credit facility in 2011 in order to maintain its current total committed capacity level.

In addition to the financial covenant noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  PPL Electric monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Electric was in material compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL Electric believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL Electric's credit facilities.

Commercial Paper

PPL Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are currently supported by PPL Electric's $200 million syndicated credit facility, which expires in December 2014, based on available capacity.

PPL Electric did not issue any commercial paper during 2010.  Based on its current cash position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Electric currently does not plan to issue any commercial paper during 2011, but it may do so from time to time, subject to market conditions, to facilitate short-term cash flow needs.

Contributions from PPL

From time to time PPL may make capital contributions to PPL Electric.  PPL Electric may use these contributions for general corporate purposes.

Long-Term Debt and Equity Securities

Subject to market conditions, PPL Electric currently plans to issue up to $250 million in long-term debt securities in 2011. PPL Electric expects to use the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt securities primarily to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

The Economic Stimulus Package

In April 2010, PPL Electric entered into an agreement with the DOE, in which the agency is to provide funding for one-half of a $38 million smart grid project.  The project would use smart grid technology to strengthen reliability, save energy and improve electric service for 60,000 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area customers.  It would also provide benefits beyond the Harrisburg region, helping to speed power restoration across PPL Electric's 29-county service territory.  Work on the project is progressing on schedule, and PPL Electric is receiving reimbursements under the grant for costs incurred.  The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of September 2012.

Forecasted Uses of Cash

In addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, and taxes, PPL Electric currently expects to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of its debt securities.

Capital Expenditures

PPL Electric's capital expenditure projections for the years 2011 through 2015 total approximately $3.4 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions.  The table includes projected costs for the asset optimization program focused on the replacement of aging transmission and distribution assets, and the PJM-approved regional transmission line expansion project.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Electric plans to fund its capital expenditures in 2011 with cash on hand, cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities.

Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2010, total unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million were excluded from this table as PPL Electric cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Dividends

From time to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Electric pays dividends on its common stock to its parent, PPL.

As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric may not pay dividends on its common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends have been paid on the 6.25% Series Preference Stock for the then-current dividend period.  PPL Electric does not, at this time, expect that such limitation would significantly impact its ability to declare dividends.

PPL Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities

PPL Electric will continue to evaluate purchasing or redeeming outstanding debt securities and may decide to take action depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash.

Credit Ratings

Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and preferred securities of PPL Electric.  Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues.  The credit ratings of PPL Electric are based on information provided by PPL Electric and other sources.  The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL Electric.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  A downgrade in PPL Electric's credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets.

In prior periodic reports, PPL Electric described its then-current debt ratings in connection with, and to facilitate, an understanding of its liquidity position.  As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the attendant uncertainties relating to the extent to which issuers of non-asset backed securities may disclose credit ratings without being required to obtain rating agency consent to the inclusion of such disclosure, or incorporation by reference of such disclosure, in a registrant's registration statement or section 10(a) prospectus, PPL Electric is limiting its credit rating disclosure to a description of the actions taken by the rating agencies with respect to PPL Electric's ratings, but without stating what ratings have been assigned to PPL Electric or its securities.  The ratings assigned by the rat
ing agencies to PPL Electric and its respective securities may be found, without charge, on each of the respective ratings agencies' websites, which ratings together with all other information contained on such rating agency websites is, hereby, explicitly not incorporated by reference in this report.

The rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL Electric in 2010.

Moody's

In April 2010, Moody's took the following actions:

·

Revised the outlook for PPL Electric;

·

Lowered the rating of PPL Electric's preferred securities;

·

Lowered the issuer rating of PPL Electric; and

·

Affirmed the senior secured rating and commercial paper rating of PPL Electric.

Moody's stated in its press release that the revision in the rating for PPL Electric, while reflective of PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE, is driven more by weakening financial metrics and the outlooks that had been in place for PPL and PPL Electric for the past year.

S&P

In April 2010, S&P affirmed its credit rating for PPL Electric following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE.

In October 2010, S&P affirmed its credit ratings for PPL Electric and revised the outlook on PPL Electric.

Fitch

In January 2010, as a result of implementing its revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities, Fitch lowered the ratings of PPL Electric's preferred stock and preference stock.  Fitch stated in its press release that the new guidelines, which apply to instruments issued by companies in all sectors, typically resulted in downgrades of one notch for many instruments that provide for the ability to defer interest or dividend payments.  Fitch stated that it has no reason to believe that such deferral will be activated.

In April 2010, Fitch affirmed its credit ratings and outlook for PPL Electric following PPL's then-announced agreement to acquire LKE.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

PPL Electric has entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.

Risk Management

Market Risk

Commodity Price and Volumetric Risk - PLR Contracts

PPL Electric is exposed to market price and volumetric risks from its obligation as PLR.  The PUC has approved a cost recovery mechanism that allows PPL Electric to pass through to customers the cost associated with fulfilling its PLR obligation.  This cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates PPL Electric's exposure to market price risk.  PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full requirement energy supply contracts for its customers.  These supply contracts transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers.

Interest Rate Risk

PPL Electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which exposes it to interest rate risk.  PPL Electric had no potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, at December 31, 2010.  Such amount was not significant at December 31, 2009.  PPL Electric estimated that a 10% decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2010 would increase the fair value of its debt portfolio by $66 million, compared with $69 million at December 31, 2009.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that PPL Electric would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations.  PPL Electric requires that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL Electric has concentrations of suppliers, financial institutions and customers.  These concentrations may impact PPL Electric's overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

In 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's post-rate cap plan to procure default electricity supply for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric had contracted for all of the electric supply for customers who elected this service in 2010.

In June 2009, the PUC approved PPL Electric's procurement plan for the period January 2011 through May 2013.  Through 2010, PPL Electric has conducted six of its 14 planned competitive solicitations.

Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit.  In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market.  All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates.  At December 31, 2010, all of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement.  There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.

See "Overview" in this Item 7 and Notes 15, 16, 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the competitive solicitations, the Agreement, credit concentration and credit risk.

Related Party Transactions

PPL Electric is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management of PPL Electric in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with PPL Electric.  See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions.

Environmental Matters

See "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters" and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental matters.

Competition

See "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - Pennsylvania Regulated Segment - Competition" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting PPL Electric.

New Accounting Guidance

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements).  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with PPL's Audit Committee.<
/font>

1)      Defined Benefits

PPL Electric participates in and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic defined benefit pension and other postretirement costs of plans sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL Electric records an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to regulatory assets.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

PPL Services makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  When accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle.  Annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in regulatory assets.  The amount in regulatory assets is amortized to income over future periods.  The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The primary assumptions are:

·

Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

·

Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes.  These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs PPL records currently.

·

Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.

·

Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

In selecting a discount rate for its U.S. defined benefit plans, PPL Services starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.  A portfolio of 604 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of $667 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate assumption.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services decreased the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans from 6.00% to 5.41% as a result of this assessment and de
creased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from 5.81% to 5.16%.

The expected long-term rates of return for PPL Services' U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits have been developed using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  PPL management corroborates these rates with expected long-term rates of return calculated by its independent actuary, who uses a building block approach that begins with a risk-free rate of return with factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk.  Each plan's specific asset allocation is also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services' expected return on plan assets decreased from 8.00% to 7.25% for its U.S. pension plan and decreased from 7.00% to 6.45% for its other postretirement bene
fit plan.

In selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL Services considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services' rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its U.S. plan.

In selecting health care cost trend rates for PPL Services' other postretirement benefit plans, PPL Services considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2010, PPL Services' health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for 2011, gradually declining to 5.50% for 2019.

A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and the regulatory assets allocated to PPL Electric.  While the charts below reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and regulatory assets by a similar amount in the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income tax effects.

At December 31, 2010, defined benefit plan liabilities were as follows.

2)      Loss Accruals

Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes.  For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured.  Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed.

The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management.  Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are used, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

No new significant loss accruals were recorded in 2010.

Certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual.  Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.

When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual are identified, where applicable.  The triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is paid or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected.

·

Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable.

Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, operation management and other parties.

3)      Income Taxes

Significant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position.  Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of ben
efit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be de-recognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.

At December 31, 2010, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by as much as $28 million or decrease by up to $42 million.  This change could result from the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.

The balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment.  Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment
 must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.

4)      Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

PPL Electric's electricity delivery business is subject to cost-based rate regulation.  As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements.  Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities.  Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to regulated customers for previous collections of costs that are expected to be refunded to customers in the future.  In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on the understanding with the regulator that current rates are 
being set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.

Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.  Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery.  This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, then asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.  Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibilit
y in the manner and timing of the depreciation of PP&E and amortization of regulatory assets.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL Electric had regulatory assets of $620 million and $542 million.  All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders,  represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPL Electric had regulatory liabilities of $32 million and $84 million.

See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a).  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We did not audit the financial statements of LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE), a wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets of $10,719 million as of December 31, 2010, and total revenues of $493
 million for the period November 1, 2010 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2010.  Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for LKE, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 2010, the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), PPL Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation

We have audited PPL Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  PPL Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting at Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As set forth in Item 9A, Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE), which is included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 32.6% and 47.3% of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and 5.8% and 5.0% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of LKE.

In our opinion, PPL Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary.  Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted.

Business and Consolidation

(PPL)

PPL is an energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in:  1) the regulated generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the regulated distribution of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; 2) the regulated distribution of electricity in the U.K.; 3) the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity in Pennsylvania; and 4) the competitive generation and marketing of electricity in portions of the northeastern and northwestern U.S.  Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are LKE, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric.

On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.  Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE).  LKE is engaged in cost-based regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, KU and LG&E.  The acquisition of LKE substantially reapportions the mix of PPL's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens PPL's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability.  The increase in regulated assets provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover costs of capital i
nvestments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions.  LKE's operating results for the two months ended December 31, 2010 are included in PPL's results of operations with no comparable amounts for 2009.  LKE's net assets acquired and obligations assumed at the acquisition date were recorded at fair value and are included in PPL's balance sheet at December 31, 2010.  See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition of LKE.

(PPL Energy Supply)

PPL Energy Funding is the parent of PPL Energy Supply.  On January 31, 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global, representing 100% of the outstanding membership interests of PPL Global, to PPL Energy Supply's parent, PPL Energy Funding, to better align PPL's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements.  The distribution was made based on the book value of the assets and liabilities of PPL Global with financial effect as of January 1, 2011.  PPL Global owns and operates WPD's electricity distribution businesses in the U.K.  See Note 24 for additional information related to the distribution.  Notes to PPL Energy Supply's Financial Statements may include PP
L Global information for years subsequent to 2010.

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL Generation owns and operates a portfolio of competitive domestic power generating assets.  These power plants are primarily located in Pennsylvania and Montana and use well-diversified fuel sources including coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water.  PPL EnergyPlus sells electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, participates in wholesale market load-following auctions, and markets various energy products and commodities such as:  capacity, transmission, FTRs, coal, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances, RECs and other commodities in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern U.S.

In 2010, PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its Long Island generation business and related tolling agreements and its remaining three hydroelectric facilities in Maine.  See Note 9 for additional information on these sales.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric is a cost-based rate-regulated subsidiary of PPL.  PPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The consolidated financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest.  Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for VIEs.  PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE, and thus are the primary beneficiary of the entity.  See "New Accounting Guidance Adopted - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" within this note for additional information and Note 22 for information regarding a significant consolidated VIE.  Investments in entities in which a company has the ability to ex
ercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method.  All other investments are carried at cost or fair value.  All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  Any noncontrolling interests are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply consolidate foreign subsidiaries on a one-month lag.  Material intervening events, such as debt issuances and retirements, acquisitions or divestitures that occur in the lag period are recognized in the current period financial statements.  Events that are significant but not material are disclosed.

The consolidated financial statements of PPL and PPL Energy Supply include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities.  See Note 14 for additional information.

Regulation

(PPL and PPL Electric)

LG&E, KU and PPL Electric are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable LG&E, KU and PPL Electric to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders.  Rates are generally established based on a test period as adjusted to exclude unusual or nonrecurring items.  As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions.  Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates.  The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise c
urrently be charged to expense.  Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized for obligations expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates or be consumed in the business operations for the effect of transactions or events that would otherwise currently be reflected as income, or in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on the understanding with the regulator that current rates include recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates but not yet expended for the intended purpose.  The accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions.  See Note 3 for additional details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

WPD operates under distribution licenses granted by and price controls set by Ofgem.  The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue is designed to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs.  The price control formula is normally determined every five years.  Ofgem completed a review in December 2009 that became effective April 1, 2010 and will continue through March 31, 2015.

WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP.

Accounting Records

(PPL and PPL Electric)

The system of accounts for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.

Use of Estimates

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Loss Accruals

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Potential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is "probable" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  PPL and its subsidiaries continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events.  PPL and its subsidiaries discount loss accruals for environmental remediation when appropriate.

PPL and its subsidiaries do not record the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains, unless recovery is assured.

Changes in Classification

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The classification of certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008 financial statements have been changed to conform to the current presentation.  The changes in classification did not affect "Net Income Attributable to PPL Corporation" or "PPL Corporation Shareowners' Common Equity," "Net Income Attributable to PPL Energy Supply" or PPL Energy Supply's "Member's equity" or "Net Income Available to PPL Corporation" or PPL Electric's "Shareowners' Equity."

The classification on the Statements of Cash Flows has not been changed for the classification of amounts to Discontinued Operations.

Comprehensive Income

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

Comprehensive income, which includes net income and OCI, consists of changes in equity from transactions not related to shareowners.  Comprehensive income is shown on PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Comprehensive Income.

AOCI, which is presented on the Balance Sheets of PPL and included in Member's Equity on the Balance Sheets of PPL Energy Supply, consisted of these after-tax gains (losses) at December 31.

Earnings Per Share

(PPL)

EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners.  Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares.

Price Risk Management

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into interest rate contracts to hedge their exposure to changes in the fair value of their debt instruments and to hedge their exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing debt instruments or forecasted issuances of debt.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, net investments and foreign earnings translation.

Certain of PPL and PPL Energy Supply's energy and energy-related contracts meet the definition of a derivative, while others do not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision.  In cases where there is no net settlement provision, PPL periodically reviews these contracts to assess whether a market mechanism has evolved which could facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because they meet the definition of NPNS.  These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting.  All other contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value.  These contracts are recorded as "Price risk manag
ement assets" and "Price risk management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  Derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities."  PPL and PPL Energy Supply record derivative positions that deliver beyond a year in "Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities."  Every trade is entered into the risk management system with an assigned strategy and accounting classification.  Processes exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of the trade information.  These strategies are discussed in more detail in Note 19.  PPL's accounting department provides the traders and the risk management department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various trade types and strategies.  Some examples of these guidelines include, but are not limited to:

·

Physical coal, limestone, uranium, electric transmission, gas transportation, gas storage and renewable energy credit contracts are not derivatives due to the lack of net settlement provisions.

·

Only contracts where physical delivery is deemed probable throughout the entire term of the contract can qualify for the NPNS exception.

·

Physical transactions that permit cash settlement and financial transactions do not qualify for NPNS because physical delivery cannot be asserted; however, these transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the future cash flows for energy-related commodities.

·

Certain purchased option contracts or net purchased option collars may receive hedge accounting treatment.  Those that are not eligible are marked to fair value through earnings.

·

Derivative transactions that do not qualify for NPNS or hedge accounting treatment are marked to fair value through earnings.

A similar process is also followed by PPL's treasury department as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives.  The following accounting guidelines are provided to the treasury department staff:

·

Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges.

·

Transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges.

·

Transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges.

·

Derivative transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to fair value through earnings or through regulatory assets/liabilites if approved by the appropriate regulatory body.  These transactions generally include hedges of earnings translation risk associated with subsidiaries that report their financial statements in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.  As such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Therefore, on the date the derivative contract is executed, PPL may designate the derivative as NPNS, a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge (foreign currency hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).  Other derivatives may be linked to certain risk management strategies, but hedge accounting treatment is not permitted or elected.  Finally, some derivatives have been entered into for proprietary trading purposes. As such, similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending o
n the intended use of such derivative instrument.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either OCI or in current-period earnings, except that LG&E records the change in fair value of its interest rate swap contracts as a regulatory asset or liability since such costs are either currently being recovered in customer rates or are probable of future recovery.

Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the underlying nature of the hedged items.

PPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions in the financial statements.  Accordingly, PPL and its subsidiaries do not offset such derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.

Gains and losses associated with non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points.  A major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply reflect their net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of Income.

See Notes 18 and 19 for additional information on derivatives.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

To meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric has entered into contracts that meet the definition of a derivative.  These contracts have been excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because they meet the definition of NPNS and are accounted for using accrual accounting.  See Notes 18 and 19 for additional information.

(PPL Energy Supply)

The Statements of Income "Utility" line item contains electric revenue from the operation of WPD's distribution network.

(PPL Electric)

Since most of PPL Electric's operations are regulated, it is not meaningful to use a "Utility" caption.  Therefore, PPL Electric's revenue is presented according to specific types of revenue.

Revenue Recognition

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Operating revenues, except for "Energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of the calendar month.  Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month.  Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per kWh.  Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are confirmed and invoiced.  At that time, unbilled revenue is reversed and actual revenue is recorded.

PPL Energy Supply records energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered.  Generally, the wholesale sales and purchases that qualify as derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes are reported gross on the Statements of Income within "Wholesale energy marketing" and "Energy purchases."  Additionally, the bilateral sales and purchases that are designated as speculative trading activities and qualify as derivative instruments for accounting purposes are reported net on the Statements of Income within "Net energy trading margins."  Spot market activity that balances PPL Energy Supply's physical trading positions is included on the Statements of Income in "Net energy trading margins."

Certain PPL subsidiaries participate in RTOs, primarily in PJM.  In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity to its customers who have selected it as a supplier and a seller for PPL's generation subsidiaries.  PPL Electric is a transmission owner and PLR in PJM.  A function of interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements (generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their MWh obligations (load plus scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day.  If the net result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with a spot-market sale to the ISO at the respective market price for that hour; if the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market purchase from the ISO at the respective market pric
e for that hour.  ISO purchases and sales are not allocated to individual customers.  PPL records the hourly net sales and purchases in its financial statements as wholesale energy marketing and energy purchases.

"Energy-related businesses" revenue includes revenue from the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries, as well as WPD's telecommunications and property subsidiaries.  The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record revenue from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost for each contract.  Accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within "Other current liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  The amount of costs in excess of billings was $9 million and $5 million at 
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the amount of billings in excess of costs was $70 million and $69 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Accounts Receivable

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Accounts receivable are reported in the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.

For PPL, see Note 10 for information related to the acquisition of LKE.  The initial accounts receivable acquired in the transaction were recorded at fair value on November 1, 2010.

PPL Electric's customers may elect to procure generation supply from an alternative supplier.  As a result of a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, PPL Electric has purchased certain accounts receivable from alternative suppliers at a nominal discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts.  Additionally, PPL Electric receives a nominal fee for administering the program.  The alternative suppliers (including PPL EnergyPlus) have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable.  The purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The purchased accounts recei
vable have substantially the same risk profile and payment terms as PPL Electric's other customer accounts receivable.  During 2010, PPL and PPL Electric purchased $607 million of accounts receivable from third parties.  During 2010, PPL Electric purchased $212 million of accounts receivable from PPL EnergyPlus.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Accounts receivable collectability is evaluated using a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms.  Reserve balances are analyzed to assess the reasonableness of the balances in comparison to the actual accounts receivable balances and write-offs.  Adjustments are made to reserve balances based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables, and historical and industry trends.

Additional specific reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, such as bankruptcies, are recorded on a case-by-case basis after having been researched and reviewed by management.  The nature of the item, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions are considered as a basis for determining the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible account balances.

Accounts receivable are charged-off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.  Recoveries of accounts receivable previously charged-off are recorded when it is known they will be received.

The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, including unbilled revenues, were:

Cash

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

Bank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents.  The change in restricted cash and cash equivalents is reported as an investing activity on the Statements of Cash Flows.  On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is shown as "Restricted cash and cash equivalents" while the noncurrent portion is included in "Other noncurrent assets."  See Note 18 for total restricted cash.  For PPL, the December 31, 2010 balance of restricted cash and cash equivalents included $19 million of cash collateral posted to counterparties related to interest rate swap contracts,  $14 million of margin deposits posted to counterpa
rties in connection with trading activities, $6 million of funds required by law to be held by WPD's captive insurance company to meet claims and $13 million of funds deposited with a trustee to defease PPL Electric's 1945 First Mortgage Bonds, as discussed in Note 7.  For PPL Energy Supply, the December 31, 2010 balance included $11 million of margin deposits posted to counterparties in connection with trading activities and $6 million of funds required by law to be held by WPD's captive insurance company to meet claims.  For PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the December 31, 2009 balance consisted primarily of margin deposits posted by counterparties to PPL Energy Supply in connection with trading activities.  For PPL Electric, the December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 balances of restricted cash and cash equivalents, including the noncurrent portion, consisted primarily of funds deposited with a trustee to defease PPL Electric's 1945 First Mortgage Bonds, as di
scussed in Note 7.

Fair Value Measurements

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its subsidiaries value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value.  Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities including investments in the NDT funds and defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents.  PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability.  These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market 
participants would use to price an asset or liability.  These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.

PPL and its subsidiaries prioritize fair value measurements for disclosure by grouping them into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy.  The highest priority is given to measurements using Level 1 inputs.  The appropriate level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

·

Level 1

- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

·

Level 2

- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

·

Level 3

-

unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value.

Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  As such, PPL and its subsidiaries' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy.  PPL and its subsidiaries recognize transfers between levels at end-of-reporting-period values.  See Notes 13, 18, and 19 for additional information on fair value measurements.

Investments

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Generally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term.  Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates.  Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in "Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheet of PPL and in "Current Assets - Other" on the Balance Sheet of PPL Electric.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Debt and equity securities that are acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near-term are classified as trading.  Trading securities are generally held to capitalize on fluctuations in their value.  All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.  Both trading and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.  The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.  Any unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings.  Through March 31, 200
9, unrealized gains and losses on all available-for-sale securities were reported, net of tax, in OCI or recognized in earnings when the decline in fair value below amortized cost was determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment.

Accounting guidance effective April 1, 2009 has modified the criteria for determining whether a decline in fair value of a debt security is other than temporary and whether the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings or reported in OCI.  Beginning April 1, 2009, when a debt security is in an unrealized loss position:

·

if there is an intent to sell the security or a requirement to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized currently in earnings; or

·

if there is no intent to sell the security or requirement to sell the security before recovery, the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is considered a credit loss is recognized currently in earnings and the remainder of the other-than-temporary impairment is reported in OCI, net of tax; or

·

if there is no intent to sell the security or requirement to sell the security before recovery and there is no credit loss, the unrealized loss is reported in OCI, net of tax.

Equity securities were not impacted by this accounting guidance; therefore, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities continue to be reported, net of tax, in OCI.  Earnings continue to be charged when an equity security's decline in fair value below amortized cost is determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment.  See Notes 18 and 23 for additional information on investments in debt and equity securities.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Property, Plant and Equipment

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PP&E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired.  The original cost for PP&E acquired in the LKE acquisition is its fair value on November 1, 2010, which approximated net book value as of the acquisition date.  See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition of LKE.  If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset.  Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable.  The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred.  PPL records costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are incurred.  No costs are accrued in advance of the period in which the
 work is performed for PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric.  PPL, through its subsidiaries LG&E and KU, accrues costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices.  Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred.  See Note 3 for additional information.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

AFUDC is capitalized as part of the construction costs for cost based rate regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service.  The debt component of AFUDC is credited to "Interest Expense" and the equity component is credited to "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statements of Income.

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

Nuclear fuel-related costs, including fuel, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and assemblies, are capitalized as PP&E.  Such costs are amortized over the period the fuel is spent using the unit-of-production method and included in "Fuel" on the Statements of Income.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply capitalize interest costs as part of construction costs for projects not subjected to cost-based rate regulation.

The following capitalized interest was excluded from "Interest Expense" on the Statements of Income.

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Included in PP&E on the balance sheet are capitalized costs of software projects that were developed or obtained for internal use.  These capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years.  Following are capitalized software costs and the accumulated amortization.

The December 31, 2010 gross carrying amount includes $84 million from the acquisition of LKE.

Amortization expense of capitalized software costs was as follows:

The amortization of capitalized software is included in "Depreciation" on the Statements of Income.

Depreciation

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods.  When a component of PP&E is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation.  When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators.

Following are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at December 31.

(a)

For PPL, the 2010 weighted-average depreciation rate was impacted by the acquisition of LKE.  In accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, the original cost for PP&E acquired in the LKE acquisition is its fair value on November 1, 2010, which approximated net book value as of the acquisition date.  This resulting lower original cost basis of LKE's PP&E was used in the calculation of the weighted-average depreciation rate for PPL for 2010.  Therefore, the consolidation of LKE results in a significantly higher weighted-average rate compared to PPL's historical rates.  Excluding LKE, PPL's 2010 weighted-average depreciation rate was 2.28%.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business.

Other acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value.  Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used.  Costs incurred to renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets.

When determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider the expected use of the asset; the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.

PPL and its subsidiaries account for emission allowances as intangible assets.  Since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not diminished until they are consumed, emission allowances are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed.  Such expense is included in "Fuel" on the Statements of Income.  Gains and losses on the sale of emission allowances are included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

PPL and its subsidiaries also account for RECs as intangible assets, and the associated costs are not expensed until the credits are consumed.  Such expense is included in "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income.  Gains and losses on the sale of RECs are included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

See Note 20 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Asset Impairment

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its subsidiaries review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying amount to its fair value.  Certain emission allowances are expected to be sold rather than consumed.  These emission allowances are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a decline in market prices, indicate that their carrying value might be impaired.  See Note 18 for a discussion of impairment charges recorded associated with long-lived assets classified as held and used.

For a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) to its fair value less cost to sell.  See Notes 9 and 18 for a discussion of impairment charges recorded associated with long-lived assets classified as held for sale.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.  Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.  PPL's reporting units are significant businesses that have discrete financial information, and the operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management.  PPL's reporting units are at or one level below its operating segments.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same m
anner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That is, the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.  The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to that difference.

The goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition of LKE, although entirely recorded at LG&E and KU, was assigned to the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition, which are the new Kentucky Regulated segment and the Supply segment.  See Note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition.

Asset Retirement Obligations

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its subsidiaries recognize various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets as liabilities in the financial statements.  Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value.  An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense classified within "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.

Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO.  Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.  See Note 21 for additional information on AROs and a discussion of the remeasurement in the third quarter of 2010 of the ARO for the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear units.

(PPL)

The accretion and depreciation, related to an ARO, recorded by LG&E and KU is offset with a regulatory asset, such that there is no income statement impact.  The regulatory asset is relieved when the ARO is settled.

Compensation and Benefits

Defined Benefits

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.  An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI or to regulatory assets or liabilities for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.

The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments.  One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.

PPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its pension plans.  Under the accelerated method, gains and losses in excess of 10% but less than 30% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants.  Gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period equal to one-half of the average future service period of the plan participants.

See Note 13 for a discussion of defined benefits.

Stock-Based Compensation

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL grants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees, and stock units and restricted stock units to directors, under several stock-based compensation plans.  PPL grants most of its stock-based awards in the first quarter of each year.  PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method.  Stock options with graded vesting (i.e., that vest in installments) are valued as a single award.  PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less than the fair value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant.  See Note 12 for a discussion of stock-based compensation.  All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets.  Stock-based co
mpensation is included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

(PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's stock-based compensation expense includes an allocation of PPL Services' expense.

Other

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the interest method or another method, generally straight-line, if the results obtained are not materially different than those that would result from the interest method.

Income Taxes

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

Significant management judgment is required in developing PPL and its subsidiaries' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position.  PPL and its subsidiaries evaluate tax positions following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The benefit recognized is measure
d at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of PPL and its subsidiaries in the future.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

PPL and its subsidiaries record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  PPL and its subsidiaries consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation allowances.  If PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made.  Likewise, if PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the va
luation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made.

PPL and its subsidiaries defer investment tax credits when the credits are utilized and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets.

PPL and its subsidiaries recognize interest and penalties in "Income Taxes" on their Statements of Income.

See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes.

(PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return.  Tax benefits are not shared between companies.  A tax benefit inures only to the entity that gave rise to said benefit.  The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.  PPL Energy Supply's intercompany tax payable was $26 million at December 31, 2010 and the intercompany tax receivable was $21 million at December 31, 2009.  PPL Electric's intercompany tax receivable was $74 million and $19 mill
ion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

The provision for PPL and PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the regulators.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheet in noncurrent "Regulatory assets" or "Regulatory liabilities" for PPL and PPL Electric.

Taxes, Other Than Income

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its subsidiaries present sales taxes in "Accounts Payable" and value-added taxes in "Taxes" on their Balance Sheets.  These taxes are not reflected on the Statements of Income.  See Note 5 for details on taxes included in "Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income.

Leases

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and its subsidiaries evaluate whether arrangements entered into contain leases for accounting purposes.

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

See Note 11 for a discussion of arrangements under which PPL and PPL Energy Supply are lessees for accounting purposes.

PPL EnergyPlus entered into several arrangements whereby PPL EnergyPlus was considered the lessor for accounting purposes.  See Note 9 for additional information regarding the 2010 sale of the Long Island generation business and the leases that were transferred to the purchaser upon completion of the sale.

Fuel, Materials and Supplies

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Fuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

"Fuel, materials and supplies" on the Balance Sheets consisted of the following at December 31.

Guarantees

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Generally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception.  However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance.  See Note 15 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees.

Treasury Stock

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL and PPL Electric restore all shares of common stock acquired to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon acquisition.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

Assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.  See "Business and Consolidation" above for a discussion regarding the use of a lag period.  Adjustments resulting from translation are recorded in AOCI.  The effect of translation is removed from AOCI upon the sale or substantial liquidation of the international subsidiary that gave rise to the translation adjustment.  The local currency is the functional currency for PPL's U.K. operating company.

Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statements of Income.  Net transaction losses were insignificant in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

New Accounting Guidance Adopted

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets

Effective January 1, 2010, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted accounting guidance issued to revise the accounting for transfers of financial assets.  This guidance:

·

eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE); therefore, QSPEs will be subject to consolidation guidance;

·

changes the requirements for the derecognition of financial assets;

·

establishes new criteria for reporting the transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale;

·

requires transferors to initially recognize, at fair value, assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer accounted for as a sale; and

·

requires enhanced disclosures to improve the transparency around transfers of financial assets and a transferor's continuing involvement.

This guidance is applied prospectively to new transfers of financial assets.  Disclosures are required for all transfers, including those entered into before the effective date.

The adoption did not have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial statements.  See Note 7 for information on PPL Electric's participation in an asset-backed commercial paper program and "Accounts Receivable" above for information on PPL Electric's purchase of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers, which are within the scope of this guidance.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

Effective January 1, 2010, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted accounting guidance issued to replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and is the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary must consolidate the VIE.  This guidance:

·

prescribes a qualitative approach focused on identifying which entity has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE;

·

requires ongoing assessments of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE;

·

requires enhanced disclosures to improve the transparency of an entity's involvement in a VIE;

·

requires that all previous consolidation conclusions be reconsidered; and

·

requires that QSPEs be evaluated for consolidation (resulting from the elimination of the QSPE concept in the guidance addressing accounting for transfers of financial assets).

The adoption did not have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial statements.  See PPL and PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets and Note 22 for enhanced VIE disclosures.

Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

Effective January 1, 2010, PPL and its subsidiaries prospectively adopted accounting guidance issued to improve disclosures about fair value measurements.  This guidance:

·

requires disclosures be provided for each class of assets and liabilities, with class determined on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities;

·

clarifies that a description of valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value is required for Level 2 and 3 recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements; and

·

for recurring fair value measurements, requires separate disclosure of significant transfers into and out of levels and the reasons for those transfers.

This guidance makes corresponding amendments to employers' disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits.

The adoption did not have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial statements.  The enhanced disclosures are presented in Notes 13 and 18.

Subsequent Measurement - Cash Flow Hedges

Effective April 1, 2010, PPL and its subsidiaries prospectively adopted accounting guidance that was issued to clarify how an entity should reflect the subsequent measurement of cash flow hedges in AOCI if, during a prior period, hedge accounting was not permitted.  This situation may arise if an entity's retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness indicated that the hedging relationship had not been highly effective in a period, but the prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness showed an expectation that the hedging relationship would be highly effective in the future; therefore, the hedging relationship continued even though hedge accounting was not permitted for a certain period.  This guidance:

·

requires that the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative that is used to determine the maximum amount of gain or loss that may be reflected in AOCI exclude the gains or losses that occurred during the period when hedge accounting was not permitted; and

·

requires that the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction exclude the changes related to the period when hedge accounting was not applied.

The adoption did not have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries; however, the impact in future periods could be material.  See "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)" in Note 19 for additional information.

Pro Forma Disclosures for Business Combinations

Effective December 31, 2010, PPL and its subsidiaries prospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations.  Under this guidance, an entity must:

·

present the pro forma disclosures as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period; and

·

disclose the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the pro forma revenue and earnings.

The adoption did not have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial statements.  Pro forma information reflecting the acquisition of LKE is presented in Note 10.

2.  Segment and Related Information

(PPL and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL completed the acquisition of LKE on November 1, 2010.  See Note 10 for additional information.  Following the November 1, 2010 acquisition of LKE, PPL is organized into four segments:  Kentucky Regulated, International Regulated (formerly International Delivery), Pennsylvania Regulated (formerly Pennsylvania Delivery) and Supply.  There were no changes to the segments other than renaming certain segments, adding a Kentucky Regulated segment and allocating interest expense related to the Equity Units to the Kentucky Regulated segment ($21 million of which was included in the Supply segment prior to the November 1, 2010 acquisition).

For PPL, the Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution operations, primarily in Kentucky and includes the allocation of interest expense from the Equity Units issued in June 2010 to fund the acquisition.  This segment also includes LKE's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky.

The International Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electric distribution operations in the U.K.  In 2009, the International Regulated segment recognized $24 million of income tax expense in Discontinued Operations related to a correction of the calculation of tax bases of the Latin American businesses sold in 2007.  In 2008, the International Regulated segment recognized income tax benefits and miscellaneous expenses in Discontinued Operations in connection with the dissolution of certain Latin American holding companies.  See Note 9 for additional information.

The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electric delivery operations of PPL Electric.  This segment also included the regulated gas delivery operations of PPL Gas Utilities prior to its sale in October 2008.  See Note 9 for additional information on the sale of PPL Gas Utilities.

The Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing and trading activities, as well as the competitive generation operations of PPL Energy Supply.  In 2010 and 2009, PPL Energy Supply sold or signed agreements to sell certain Supply segment facilities and businesses.  See Note 9 for additional information.

"Unallocated Costs" represent one-time LKE acquisition-related costs including advisory, accounting and legal fees, certain internal costs and Bridge Facility costs.  See Note 7 for additional information about the Bridge Facility.

The results of several facilities and businesses have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statements of Income.  See Note 9 for additional information on these discontinued operations.  Therefore, with the exception of net income attributable to PPL/PPL Energy Supply, the operating results from these facilities and businesses have been excluded from the income statement data tables below.

PPL Energy Supply's reportable segments are International Regulated and Supply.  In 2010, there were no significant changes to these segments.  While the International Regulated segment at PPL Energy Supply is consistent with the International Regulated segment at PPL, the Supply segment information reported by PPL Energy Supply does not equal the Supply segment information reported by PPL because additional Supply segment functions exist at PPL.  Further, certain income items, including PLR revenue and certain interest income with affiliates, exist at PPL Energy Supply but are eliminated in consolidation by PPL.  Finally, certain expense items are fully allocated to the segments by PPL only.

Segment costs include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate service costs, from PPL Services.  These service costs include functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services.  See Note 16 for additional information.

Financial data for the segments are:

(a)

Includes unrealized gains and losses from economic activity.  See Note 19 for additional information.

(b)

Gas was combined with Electric because it was not significant.

(c)

See "PLR Contracts" and "NUG Purchases" in Note 16 for a discussion of the basis of accounting between reportable segments.

(d)

Includes interest income from affiliate(s).

(e)

Includes interest expense with affiliate.

(f)

Represents both current and deferred income taxes

(g)

Includes Discontinued Operations.  See Note 9 for additional information.

(h)

The PPL asset balances at December 31, 2010 for the Kentucky Regulated and Supply segments include the assignment of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of LKE.  See Note 10 for additional information.

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric operates under one reportable segment, the regulated electric delivery operations in Pennsylvania.

3.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

(PPL and PPL Electric)

As discussed in Note 1, PPL and PPL Electric reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations as summarized below.  Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.  As such, the primary items classified as current are related to rate mechanisms that periodically adjust to account for over- or under-collections.

For PPL, LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and notes payable) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and environmental compliance costs recovered separately through the environmental cost recovery (ECR) mechanism.  As such, regulatory assets are generally earning a return.

As a result of purchase accounting, certain fair value amounts, reflecting contracts that have favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market, were recorded on the balance sheet with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability.  Prior to the acquisition, LKE recovered in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances and this rate treatment will continue after the acquisition.  As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value amounts meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate making impact of the fair value adjustments.  LKE's customer rates will continue to reflect these items (e.g. coal, purchased power, emission allowances) at their original contracted prices.<
/font>

For PPL, KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions).  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates.

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant less deferred taxes and miscellaneous additions and deductions).  PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update.  See "Transmission Formula Rate" below for additional information on this tariff.  All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets.

(a)

The differences between PPL's and PPL Electric's balances are due to the consolidation of LG&E and KU.

(b)

These regulatory assets and liabilities were recorded as offsets to certain intangible assets and liabilities recorded at fair value from the acquisition of LKE.  See Note 10

for information on the acquisition and Note 20 for information on intangible assets.

(PPL)

Environmental Cost Recovery

Kentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs of complying with the Federal Clean Air Act, and those federal, state or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities utilized for production of energy from coal, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested.  The regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been over- or under-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism.

Coal Contracts

As a result of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of LKE, the fair value of LKE's coal contracts was recorded on the balance sheet.  An offsetting regulatory asset was recorded for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to market.  An offsetting regulatory liability was recorded for those contracts that had favorable terms relative to market.  These regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire through 2016.

Interest Rate Swaps

Since realized amounts associated with LG&E's interest rate swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through rates based on an order from the KPSC, LG&E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability until they are realized as interest expense.  Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033.  Interest expense related to the terminated swap contract is recovered over the remaining life of the debt as of the date of the termination, which extends through 2035.

Emission Allowances

As a result of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of LKE, LKE's emission allowances were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with an offsetting regulatory liability.  This regulatory liability is being amortized as the emission allowances are consumed, which is expected to occur through 2040.

Demand Side Management (DSM)

DSM consists of energy efficiency programs which are intended to reduce peak demand and delay the investment in additional power plant construction, provide customers with tools and information to become better managers of their energy usage and prepare for potential future legislation governing energy efficiency.  The rates of LG&E and KU contain a DSM provision which includes a rate mechanism that provides for concurrent recovery of DSM costs and provides an incentive for implementing DSM programs.  The provision allows LG&E and KU to recover revenues from lost sales associated with the DSM programs up to the earlier of three years or implementation of new base rates which reflect that load reduction.

Gas Supply Clause

LG&E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in LG&E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC.  The gas supply clause procedure prescribed by the KPSC provides for quarterly rate adjustments to reflect the expected cost of natural gas supply in that quarter.  In addition, the gas supply clause contains a mechanism whereby any over- or under-recoveries of natural gas supply cost from prior quarters are refunded to or recovered from customers through the adjustment factor determined for subsequent quarters.

Power Purchase Agreement

As a result of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of LKE, the fair value of the OVEC power purchase agreement was recorded on the balance sheet with an offsetting regulatory liability.  This regulatory liability is being amortized over the same terms as the related contract, which will expire in March 2026.

Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC)

LG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain an FAC, whereby increases and decreases in the cost of fuel for electric generation are reflected in the rates charged to retail electric customers.  The FAC allows LG&E and KU to adjust billed amounts for the difference between the fuel cost component of base rates and the actual fuel cost, including transportation costs.  The balance at December 31, 2010 was insignificant.

KU also employs an FAC mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs.  The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the coming year plus an adjustment for any over- or under-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior year.

The KPSC requires public hearings at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel clause and transfer of the then current fuel adjustment charge or credit to the base charges.  In August 2010, the KPSC initiated a six-month review of LG&E's and KU's FAC mechanism for the billing period ended April 2010.  An Order was received in December 2010 approving the charges and credits billed during the period.

The Mine Safety and Health Administration enacted Emergency Temporary Standards regulations in 2006 and has since issued additional regulations as the result of the passage of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006.  At the state level, Kentucky and other states from which coal is supplied to LG&E and KU have passed mine safety legislation.  This legislation requires all underground coal mines to implement new safety measures and install new safety equipment.  Under the terms of the majority of the long-term coal contracts that LG&E and KU have in place, provisions allow for price adjustments for compliance costs resulting from new or amended laws or regulations.  LG&E's and KU's coal suppliers regularly submit price adjustments related to these compliance costs.
0; LG&E and KU employ an external consultant to review all relevant mine safety compliance cost claims for validity and reasonableness.  Depending upon the terms of the contracts and commercial practice, LG&E and KU may delay payment of the adjustments or pay certain adjustments subject to refund.  At appropriate times in the review, payment or refund processes, LG&E and KU adjust the values or amounts of inventory, accounts receivable or accounts payable relating to coal matters.  In general, LG&E and KU expect to recover these coal-related cost adjustments through the FAC.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Generation Supply Charge (GSC)

The GSC is a recovery mechanism which provides PPL Electric recovery for costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service.  The recovery includes an energy charge, capacity charge and an administrative charge.  In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over-or under-recovery from prior quarters is to be refunded to or recovered from customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarter.

Universal Service Rider (USR)

PPL Electric's distribution rates include a recovery of applicable costs associated with the universal service programs provided to PPL Electric's residential customers.  Universal service programs include low-income programs, such as OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program (WRAP).  OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households within the federal poverty level who are payment-troubled.  This program is funded by residential customers and administered by community-based organizations.  Customers who participate in OnTrack receive assistance in the form of reduced payment arrangements, protection against shutoff of electric service and referrals to other community programs and services.  The WRAP program reduces electric bills and improves living comfort for low-income 
customers by providing services such as weatherization measures and energy education services.  The USR is applied to distribution charges for each customer who receives distribution service under PPL Electric's residential service rate schedules.  The USR contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over-or under-recovery from the current year is refunded to or recovered from customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.

Transmission Formula Rate

Transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.  Beginning November 1, 2008, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved PJM open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism.  The tariff allows for recovery of actual transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission plant placed in service and an incentive return, including a return on construction work in progress, on the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line project.  The tariff utilizes estimated costs for the current year billing to customers and requires a true-up to adjust for actual costs in the subsequent year's rate.  In August 2009, the FERC approved this formula-based rate recovery mechanism.  As a result, the annual update of the rate is now implemen
ted automatically without requiring specific approval by the FERC before going into effect.  PPL Electric accrues or defers revenues applicable to any estimated true-up of this formula-based rate.

In 2009, PPL Electric recorded a $3 million pre-tax true-up ($2 million after-tax) related to the 2008 portion of the FERC formula-based transmission revenues.  The true-up, reflected in the Pennsylvania Regulated segment for PPL, is not considered by management as material to the financial statements of PPL and PPL Electric for the years 2009 and 2008.  See Note 15 for additional information on the FERC transmission rates.

Defined Benefit Plans

Recoverable costs of defined benefit plans represent the portion of unrecognized transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial losses that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices.  These regulatory assets are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of PPL's defined benefit plans is re-measured.

PPL

PPL Electric





Transition obligation

$


Of these costs, $40 million for PPL and $9 million for PPL Electric are expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2011.  All costs will be amortized over the average service lives of plan participants.

Taxes Recoverable through Future Rates and Regulatory Liability associated with Net Deferred Tax Assets

Taxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices.  Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized.  For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately.  This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred.

The regulatory liability associated with net deferred tax assets represents the future revenue impact from the reversal of deferred income taxes required primarily for unamortized investment tax credits.  This regulatory liability is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax asset is recognized.  For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory liability and the deferred tax asset are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately.

Storm Costs

For PPL, in September 2009, the KPSC approved deferral of $101 million of costs associated with a severe ice storm that occurred in January 2009 and a wind storm that occurred in February 2009.  Additionally, in December 2008, the KPSC approved deferral of $26 million of costs associated with high winds from the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008.  These costs are being amortized over a ten-year period ending July 2020.

For PPL Electric, in 2007, the PUC approved recovery of $12 million of costs associated with severe ice storms that occurred in January 2005.  Amortization began in January 2008 and will continue through August 2015.

Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing).  Such costs are being amortized through 2036 for PPL and through 2029 for PPL Electric.

Accumulated Costs of Removal

For PPL, LG&E and KU accrue for costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability.  The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.  See Note 1 for additional information.

PPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal.  When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the deferral of costs as a reduction to accumulated depreciation.  Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent 5-year period.

PURTA Tax

In December 2009, PPL Electric reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue related to the appeal of its 1997 PURTA tax assessments that resulted in a reduction in PURTA tax.  The regulatory liability is being refunded to customers in 2011 pursuant to PUC regulations.

Transmission Service Charge (TSC)

PPL Electric is charged transmission-related costs by PJM applicable to PLR customers.  PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers who receive basic generation supply service through the PUC-approved TSC recovery mechanism.  The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to or collected from customers through a transmission service charge adjustment the subsequent year.

Competitive Transition Costs

Competitive transition costs were billed to customers as a result of PUC orders, which allowed PPL Electric to recover its competitive transition (or stranded) costs over a transition period ending December 31, 2009.  These costs were over-collected at the end of 2009 and were refunded to customers in 2010.

Act 129 Compliance Rider

In compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric filed its energy efficiency and conservation plan in July 2009.  The plan was approved by PUC Order in October 2009.  The Order allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $250 million cost of the program ratably over the life of the plan, from January 1, 2010 through May 31, 2013.  The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption.  The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs.  The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider.  The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or unde
r-recovery from customers will be refunded or collected at the end of the program.  See Note 15 for additional information on Act 129.

Smart Meter Rider

In compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric filed its Smart Meter Plan in 2009.  The plan was approved by a PUC Order in June 2010.  In August 2010, PPL Electric filed its revised Smart Meter Plan reflecting modification identified by the PUC its Order.  In December 2010, the PUC issued a Secretarial Letter approving PPL Electric's Smart Meter Rider which is designed to recover Smart Meter program costs plus a return on Smart Meter investments.  The Smart Meter Rider is effective January 1, 2011 and contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to or collected from customers in the subsequent year.

While they were outstanding, PPL Energy Supply's 2-5/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (Convertible Senior Notes), which were issued in May 2003, could be converted into shares of PPL common stock under certain circumstances, including if during a fiscal quarter the market price of PPL's common stock exceeded $29.83 per share over a certain period during the preceding fiscal quarter or if PPL Energy Supply called the debt.  During 2008, all then-outstanding Convertible Senior Notes were either converted at the election of the holders or redeemed at par by PPL Energy Supply.

The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes required cash settlement of the principal amount and permitted settlement of any conversion premium in cash or PPL common stock.  Based upon the conversion rate of 40.2212 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or $24.8625 per share), the Convertible Senior Notes had a dilutive impact when the average market price of PPL common stock equaled or exceeded $24.87.

During 2010, PPL issued 312,107 shares of common stock related to the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and conversion of stock units granted to directors under its stock-based compensation plans.  In addition, PPL issued 234,211 and 2,162,012 shares of common stock related to its ESOP and its DRIP.  See Note 12 for a discussion of PPL's stock-based compensation plans.

In June 2010, PPL issued 103.5 million shares of common stock and 23 million Equity Units pursuant to concurrent registered underwritten offerings.  See Note 7 for additional information.  Subject to antidilution adjustments, the maximum number of shares that could potentially be issued to settle the Purchase Contracts related to the Equity Units is 61,136,300 shares, including 47,915,900 shares that could be issued under standard provisions of the Purchase Contracts and 13,220,400 shares that could be issued under make-whole provisions in the event of early settlement upon a Fundamental Change.

The Purchase Contracts will be dilutive only if the average VWAP of PPL's common stock for a certain period exceeds $28.80.  Because the average VWAP has not exceeded $28.80 since issuance, the Purchase Contracts were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

The following stock options to purchase PPL common stock and performance units were excluded from the computations of diluted EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  The provision for PPL's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles of the applicable jurisdiction.  See Notes 1 and 3 for additional information.

Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of future taxable income for the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which PPL's operations have historically been profitable.

Significant components of PPL's deferred income tax assets and liabilities from continuing operations were as follows:

Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized.  The changes in deferred tax valuation allowances were:

(a)

A valuation allowance was recorded against certain deferred tax assets as a result of the 2010 acquisition of LKE.  See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition.

(b)

Resulting from the projected revenue increase in connection with the expiration of the Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010, the valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards over the remaining carryforward period was reduced by $72 million (or $0.17 per share, basic and diluted).

(c)

Related to the change in foreign net operating loss carryforwards, including the change in foreign currency exchange rates.

(d)

Primarily from the projected revenue increase in connection with the expiration of the Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010, the valuation allowance related to a portion of state net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by $13 million.

PPL Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of WPD, as management has determined that the earnings are permanently reinvested.  Historically, dividends paid by WPD have been distributions of the current year's earnings.  WPD's long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of WPD's undistributed earnings, and WPD would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any distributions in excess of current earnings.  Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or anticipate WPD distributing any more than future earnings to its parent in the U.S.  The cumulative undistributed earnings are included i
n "Earnings Reinvested" on the Balance Sheets.  The amounts considered permanently reinvested at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $837 million and $622 million.  If the earnings are remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

Pennsylvania H.B. 1531, enacted in October 2009, increased the net operating loss limitation to 20% of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2010.  During 2009, based on the projected revenue increase due to the expiration of the Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010, PPL recorded a $13 million state deferred income tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances for a portion of its Pennsylvania net operating losses.  During 2010, PPL recorded an additional $72 million state deferred income tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances related to the future projections of taxable income over the remaining carryforward period of the net operating losses.

(b)

During 2010, PPL recorded additional U.S. income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends and certain restructuring of U.K. entities.  The increased taxable dividends allowed PPL to fully utilize its foreign tax credit carryforward in 2010.

(c)

In 1997, the U.K. imposed a Windfall Profits Tax on privatized utilities, including WPD.  In September 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in PPL's favor in a pending dispute with the IRS, concluding that the U.K. Windfall Profits Tax is a creditable tax for U.S. tax purposes.  As a result and with the finalization of other issues, PPL recorded a $42 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves and related deferred income taxes during 2010.  In January 2011, the IRS appealed the U.S. Tax Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  See Note 15 for additional information.

In July 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in PPL's favor in a pending dispute with the IRS, concluding that street lighting assets are depreciable for tax purposes over seven years.  As a result, PPL recorded a $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves and related deferred income taxes.  See Note 15 for information on the January 2011 IRS appeal, which at this time does not appear to include the street lighting decision.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008 PPL recorded a $7 million, $6 million and $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization.

(d)

During 2010, PPL recorded a $46 million foreign tax benefit in conjunction with losses resulting from restructuring in the U.K.  These losses offset tax on a deferred gain from a prior year sale of WPD's supply business.

During 2009, PPL recorded a $46 million foreign tax benefit and a related $46 million tax reserve related to losses resulting from restructuring in the U.K.  Additionally, PPL recorded a $29 million foreign tax benefit related to the resolution of a tax dispute and foreign currency exchange losses.

(e)

During 2009, PPL received consent from the IRS to change its method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes.  PPL deducted the resulting IRC Sec. 481 adjustment on its 2008 federal income tax return and recorded a $24 million adjustment to federal and state income tax expense resulting from the reduction in federal income tax benefits related to the domestic manufacturing deduction and certain state tax benefits related to state net operating losses and regulated depreciation.

(f)

During 2010, PPL recorded an increase in tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing deductions due to an increase in domestic taxable income resulting from the expiration of Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010.  In December 2010, Congress enacted legislation allowing for 100% bonus depreciation on qualified property.  The increased tax depreciation deduction related to bonus depreciation significantly reduced the tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing deductions during 2010.

(g)

Beginning in 2013, provisions within Health Care Reform eliminated the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D Coverage.  As a result, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense during 2010.  See Note 13 for additional information.

(h)

The U.K.'s Finance Act of 2010, enacted in July 2010, included a reduction in the U.K. statutory income tax rate.  Effective April 1, 2011, the statutory income tax rate will be reduced from 28% to 27%.  As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit.

The U.K.'s Finance Act of 2008, enacted in July 2008, included a phase-out of tax depreciation on certain buildings.  As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit.

(i)

During 2010, PPL recorded a deferred tax benefit related to investment tax credits on progress expenditures related to hydroelectric plant expansions.  See Note 8 for additional information.

During 2008, PPL recorded a $13 million expense to adjust the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits recorded during 2007.  See Note 15 for additional information.

For tax years 2000 through 2007, PPL Montana protested certain property tax assessments by the Montana Department of Revenue on its generation facilities.  The tax liabilities in dispute for 2000 through 2007, which had been paid and expensed by PPL Montana, totaled $45 million.  In January 2008, both parties reached a settlement for all years outstanding.  The settlement resulted in PPL Montana receiving a refund of taxes paid and interest totaling $8 million.  This settlement was recorded in 2008, of which $7 million was reflected in "Taxes, other than income" and $1 million was reflected in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income.

PPL Energy Supply had a federal foreign tax credit carryforward of $23 million at December 31, 2009 that was fully utilized during 2010.  PPL Energy Supply also had state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2011 and 2030 of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized.

PPL Global had foreign capital loss carryforwards of $1.4 billion and $514 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  All of these losses have an indefinite carryforward period.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized.

Changes in deferred tax valuation allowances were

:

(a)

Resulting from the projected revenue increase in connection with the expiration of the Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010, the valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards over the remaining carryforward period was reduced by $52 million.

(b)

Primarily related to the change in foreign net operating loss carryforwards including the change in foreign currency exchange rates.

(c)

Pennsylvania state legislation, enacted in 2007 and 2009, increased the net operating loss limitation.  As a result, the deferred tax asset (and related valuation allowance) associated with certain of its Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards for all periods presented were increased to reflect the higher limitation.  There was no impact on the net deferred tax asset position as a result of the legislation and related adjustments.

PPL Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of WPD, as management has determined that the earnings are permanently reinvested.  Historically, dividends paid by WPD have been distributions of the current year's earnings.  WPD's long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of WPD's undistributed earnings, and WPD would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any distributions in excess of current earnings.  Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or anticipate WPD distributing any more than future earnings to its parent in the U.S.  The cumulative undistributed earnings are included i
n "Members Equity" on the Balance Sheets.  The amounts considered permanently reinvested at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $837 million and $622 million.  If the earnings are remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

During 2010, PPL Energy Supply recorded an increase in tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing deductions due to an increase in domestic taxable income resulting from the expiration of Pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010.  In December 2010, Congress enacted legislation allowing for 100% bonus depreciation on qualified property.  The increased tax depreciation deduction related to bonus depreciation significantly reduced the tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing deductions during 2010.

(f)

During 2009, PPL Energy Supply received consent from the IRS to change its method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes.  PPL Energy Supply deducted the resulting IRC Sec. 481 adjustment on its 2008 federal income tax return and recorded a $21 million adjustment to federal and state income tax expense resulting from the reduction in federal income tax benefits related to the domestic manufacturing deduction and certain state tax benefits related to state net operating losses.

(g)

Beginning in 2013, provisions within Health Care Reform eliminated the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D Coverage.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply recorded deferred income tax expense during 2010.  See Note 13 for additional information.

(h)

The U.K.'s Finance Act of 2010, enacted in July 2010, included a reduction in the U.K. statutory income tax rate.  Effective April 1, 2011, the statutory income tax rate will be reduced from 28% to 27%.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit.

The U.K.'s Finance Act 2008, enacted in July 2008, included a phase-out of tax depreciation on certain buildings.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit.

(i)

During 2010, PPL Energy Supply recorded a deferred tax benefit related to investment tax credits on progress expenditures related to hydroelectric plant expansions.  See Note 8 for additional information.

During 2008, PPL Energy Supply recorded a $13 million expense to adjust the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits recorded during 2007.  See Note 15 for additional information.

For tax years 2000 through 2007, PPL Montana protested certain property tax assessments by the Montana Department of Revenue on its generation facilities.  The tax liabilities in dispute for 2000 through 2007, which had been paid and expensed by PPL Montana, totaled $45 million.  In January 2008, both parties reached a settlement for all years outstanding.  The settlement resulted in PPL Montana receiving a refund of taxes paid and interest totaling $8 million.  This settlement was recorded in 2008, of which $7 million was reflected in "Taxes, other than income" and $1 million was reflected in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income.

(PPL Electric)

The provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and the FERC.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included in "Regulatory assets" on the Balance Sheets.

Significant components of PPL Electric's deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

In July 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in PPL Electric's favor in a pending dispute with the IRS, concluding that street lighting assets are depreciable for tax purposes over seven years.  As a result, PPL Electric recorded a $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves and related deferred income taxes.  See Note 15 for information on the January 2011 IRS appeal, which at this time does not appear to include the street lighting decision.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008 PPL Electric recorded a $7 million, $6 million and $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization.

During 2009, PPL Electric received consent from the IRS to change its method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes.  PPL Electric deducted the resulting IRC Sec. 481 amount on its 2008 federal income tax return and recorded a $3 million adjustment to federal and state income tax expense resulting from the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation.

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On February 24, 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania tax purposes.  Corporation Tax Bulletin 2011-01 indicates that Pennsylvania will allow 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for Federal tax purposes.  PPL is still evaluating the impact of this guidance and, while not yet quantified, its impact could be material.

At December 31, 2010, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by as much as $28 million or decrease by up to $226 million for PPL, increase by as much as $1 million or decrease by up to $181 million for PPL Energy Supply and increase by as much as $28 million or decrease by up to $42 million for PPL Electric.  These changes could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign taxes, the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  The events that could cause thes
e changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.

At December 31, 2010, the total unrecognized tax benefits and related indirect effects that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate were:

The amounts recognized during 2010, 2009 and 2008 for PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric were primarily the result of litigation, settlements with taxing authorities, additional interest accrued or reversed related to tax positions of prior years and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, with respect to certain issues.

PPL or its subsidiaries file tax returns in five major tax jurisdictions.  The income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return.  See Note 1 for additional information regarding PPL's tax sharing policy.  Based on this tax sharing agreement, PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in five major tax jurisdictions and PPL Electric or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, at December 31, 2010, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years that are no long

Preferred Stock

(PPL)

PPL is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock.  No PPL preferred stock was issued or outstanding in 2010, 2009, or 2008.

PPL classifies preferred securities of a subsidiary as "Noncontrolling Interests" on the Balance Sheets.  Dividend requirements of $17 million for 2010 and $18 million for 2009 and 2008 were included in "Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests" on the Statements of Income.

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric is authorized to issue up to 629,936 shares of 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and 10 million shares of series preferred stock.

In April 2010, PPL Electric redeemed all five series of its outstanding preferred stock, with a par value in the aggregate of $51 million, for $54 million including accumulated dividends.  The redeemed shares are no longer outstanding and represent only the right to receive the applicable redemption price, to the extent the shares have not yet been presented for payment.  The premium of $3 million is included in "Distributions on Preferred Securities" on the Statement of Income.

Preference Stock

(PPL Electric)

There were 10 million shares of Preference Stock authorized and 2.5 million shares of PPL Electric's 6.25% Series Preference Stock (Preference Shares) issued and outstanding in 2010, 2009 and 2008.  The Preference Shares are held by a bank that acts as depositary for 10 million depositary shares, each of which represents a quarter interest in a share of Preference Shares.  Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Preference Shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights, exercised through the bank acting as a depositary.  The Preference Shares rank senior to PPL Electric's common stock; they have no voting rights, except as provided by law, and they have a liquidation preference of $100 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary sh
are).  The Preference Shares, which have no stated maturity date and no sinking fund requirements, are redeemable by PPL Electric on or after April 6, 2011 for $100 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share).

Dividends on the Preference Shares will be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, or $1.5625 per depositary share per year, and are not cumulative.  PPL Electric may not pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid for the then-current dividend period.

7.  Financing Activities

Credit Arrangements and Short-term Debt

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity and provide credit support, and as a backstop to commercial paper programs, when necessary.  The following credit facilities were in place at:

(a)

Amounts borrowed are recorded as "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets.

(b)

LG&E and KU each entered into a $400 million syndicated credit facility upon closing of the acquisition of LKE on November 1, 2010.  Under the facilities, LG&E and KU each have the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  Borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the respective company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  Each company also pays customary commitment and letter of credit issuance fees under its respective facility.  The new credit facilities each contain a financial covenant requiring the respective borrower's debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70%, as calculated in accordance with the credit facilities, and other customary covenants.  Additionally, subject to certain conditions, LG&E and KU may each request that its respective facility'
s capacity be increased by up to $100 million.  An aggregate of $9 million of fees were incurred in 2010 in connection with establishing these facilities.  Such fees were deferred and are being amortized through December 2014.

(c)

The borrowing outstanding at December 31, 2010 bears interest at 2.27%.  Such borrowing was repaid in January 2011 with proceeds received from the remarketing of certain tax-exempt bonds that were held by LG&E at December 31, 2010, as discussed below in "Long-term Debt and Equity Securities."

(d)

In October 2010, PPL Energy Supply entered into a new $4 billion syndicated credit facility to replace its $400 million 364-day Syndicated Credit Facility, which expired in September 2010, and the $3.2 billion 5-year Syndicated Credit Facility.  PPL Energy Supply subsequently reduced the capacity of the facility to $3 billion effective December 2010.  Under this facility, PPL Energy Supply has the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  Borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  PPL Energy Supply also pays customary commitment and letter of credit issuance fees under this facility.  Similar to the facilities that were replaced, the new credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring PPL Energy Supply's debt to total
 capitalization to not exceed 65%, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.  Additionally subject to certain conditions, PPL Energy Supply may request that the facility's capacity be increased by up to $500 million.

In October 2010, PPL Energy Supply borrowed $3.2 billion under this facility in order to enable a subsidiary to make loans to certain affiliates to provide interim financing of amounts required by PPL to partially fund PPL's acquisition of LKE.  Such borrowing bore interest at 2.26% and was refinanced by PPL primarily through the issuance of long-term debt by LG&E and KU Energy LLC, LG&E and KU, and the use of internal funds.  This borrowing and related repayments are included in "Net increase (decrease) in short-term debt" on the Statement of Cash Flows.  See "Long-term Debt and Equity Securities" below for a discussion of these debt issuances and the use of proceeds to repay affiliate loans.

PPL Energy Supply incurred an aggregate of $41 million of fees in 2010 in connection with establishing the new facility.  Such fees were initially deferred and amortized through December 2014.  In connection with the reduction in the capacity to $3 billion in December 2010, PPL Energy Supply wrote off $10 million, $6 million after tax, of deferred fees, which is reflected in "Interest Expense" in the Statement of Income.

The borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010 bear interest at 2.27%.

(e)

In March 2010, PPL Energy Supply's 364-day bilateral credit facility was amended.  The amendment included extending the expiration date to March 2013, thereby making it a three-year facility, and setting related commitment and utilization fees based on the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  Under this facility, PPL Energy Supply can request the bank to issue letters of credit but cannot make cash borrowings.  This credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring PPL Energy Supply's debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65%, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, and other customary covenants.

(f)

Under this facility, PPL Energy Supply has the ability to request the lenders to issue letters of credit but cannot make cash borrowings.  PPL Energy Supply's obligations under this facility are supported by a $300 million letter of credit issued on PPL Energy Supply's behalf under a separate, but related, $300 million five-year credit agreement, also expiring in March 2011.  This credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring PPL Energy Supply's debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65%, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, and other customary covenants.

(g)

This $3.2 billion facility was terminated in October 2010 and was replaced with a new syndicated credit facility as discussed above.  Under this facility, which had an expiration date of June 2012, PPL Energy Supply had the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  Borrowings generally bore interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding at December 31, 2009 was 0.73%.

(h)

This $400 million facility expired in September 2010.  Under this facility, PPL Energy Supply had the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue up to $200 million of letters of credit.

(i)

Under this facility, WPDH Limited has the ability to make cash borrowings but cannot request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  WPDH Limited pays customary commitment fees under this facility, and borrowings bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending on the company's long-term credit rating.  The cash borrowing outstanding at December 31, 2010 was a USD-denominated borrowing of $181 million, which equated to £115 million at the time of borrowing and bears interest at approximately 0.94%.  The interest rates at December 31, 2009 were approximately 1.55% on a USD-denominated borrowing of $181 million, which equated to £107 million at the time of borrowing, and a weighted-average rate of approximately 1.53% on GBP-denominated borrowings aggregating £25 million.

This credit facility contains financial covenants that require WPDH Limited to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and a RAB that exceeds total net debt by the higher of an amount equal to 15% of total net debt or £150 million, in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit facility.

(j)

Under this facility, WPD (South West) has the ability to make cash borrowings but cannot request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  WPD (South West) pays customary commitment fees under this facility, and borrowings bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a margin.  The weighted-average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009 was approximately 3.02%.

The facility contains financial covenants that require WPD (South West) to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its RAB, in each case calculated in accordance with the credit facility.

(k)

The weighted-average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2009 was 1.22%.

(l)

The total amount borrowed under WPD's credit facilities equated to $181 million and approximately $354 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  At December 31, 2010, the unused capacity of the WPD credit facilities was approximately $475 million.

(m)

In December 2010, PPL Electric entered into a new $200 million syndicated credit facility to replace its $190 million 5-year Syndicated Credit Facility.  Under this facility, PPL Electric has the ability to make cash borrowings and to request the lenders to issue letters of credit.  Borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's senior secured long-term debt rating.  The new credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring PPL Electric's debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70%, as calculated in accordance with the credit facility, and other customary covenants.  PPL Electric also pays customary commitment and letter of credit issuance fees under this facility.  Additionally, subject to certain conditions, PPL Electric may request that the facility's capacity be increased by up to $100 million. &#
160;An aggregate of $2 million of fees were incurred in 2010 in connection with establishing this facility.  Such fees were deferred and are being amortized through December 2014.</font></div>

The first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds.  These first mortgage bonds were issued under the LG&amp;E 2010 Mortgage Indenture and the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in (d) above.  The related tax-exempt revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in Kentucky, on behalf of LG&amp;E and KU.  The related revenue bond documents allow LG&amp;E and KU to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rat

At December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $183 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LG&amp;E and KU were in a term rate mode and had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.31%.  The remaining $742 million were in either a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate or auction rate mode and had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.45% at December 31, 2010.</font></div>

<div align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Several series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds are insured by monoline bond insurers whose ratings were reduced due to exposures relating to insurance of sub-prime mortgages.  Of the bonds outstanding, $231 million are in the form of insured auction rate securities, wherein interest rates are reset either weekly or every 35 days via an auction process.  Beginning in late 2007, the interest rates on these insured bonds began to increase due to investor concerns about the creditworthiness of the bond insurers.  During 2008, interest rates increased, and LG&amp;E and KU experienced failed auctions when there were insufficient bids for the bonds.  When a failed auction occurs, the interest rate is set pursuant to a formula stipulated in the indenture.  Since the date of acquisition of LKE by PPL, the average rate on LG&amp;E's and KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.4
9%.  As noted above, the instruments governing these auction rate bonds permit LG&amp;E and KU to convert the bonds to other interest rate modes.</font></div>

One tranche will mature on or about the third anniversary of the settlement of the remarketing, and the other tranche will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of such settlemen

The 2018 Notes will be remarketed as subordinated, unsecured obligations of PPL Capital Funding, as PPL Capital Funding notified the trustee in September 2010 of its irrevocable election to maintain the subordination provisions of the notes and related guarantees in a remarketing.  Upon a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the 2018 Notes may be reset and the maturity of the tranches may be modified as necessary.  In connection with a remarketing, PPL Capital Funding may elect, with respect to each tranche, to extend or eliminate the early redemption date and/or calculate interest on the notes of a tranche on a fixed or floating rate basis.  If the remarketing fails, holders of the 2018 Notes will have the right to put their notes to PPL Capital Funding on July 1, 2013 for an amount equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest.</font></div>

As a result, the 2018 Notes were recorded at $1.150 billion, which approximated fair value, as long-term debt.  At the time of issuance, the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $157 million was recorded to other liabilities, representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to capital in excess of par value for the issuance of the Purchase Contracts, which approximated the fair value of each.  The liability is being accreted through interest expense over the three-year term
 of the Purchase Contracts.  The initial valuation of the contract adjustment payments is considered a non-cash transaction that is excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows in 2010.  Costs to issue the Equity Units were primarily allocated on a relative cost basis, resulting in $29 million being recorded to capital in excess of par value and $7 million being recorded to other noncurrent assets.

In 2008, PPL withdrew the application due to then-prevailing economic conditions, including the high cost of capital and projected future energy prices.  As a result, the Supply segment recorded an impairment of $22 million ($13 million after tax), which is included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.  In 2009, PPL filed a new application with the FERC to expand capacity at its Holtwood hydroelectric plant, which the FERC approved.  PPL reconsidered this project in light of the availability of tax incentives and potential federal loan guarantees for renewable projects contained in the Economic Stimulus Package.  The expansion project has an expected capital cost o
f approximately $434 million.  Construction continues on the project, with commercial operations scheduled to begin in 2013.  At December 31, 2010, expected remaining expenditures are $304 million.</font></div>

PPL has recognized investment tax credits and is evaluating whether to seek Treasury grants in lieu of the credits.  During 2010, PPL recorded deferred investment tax credits of $52 million related to tax years 2010 and 2009.  PPL anticipates recognizing an additional $90 million in tax credits for tax years 2011 and 2012.  These credits reduce PPL's tax liability and will be amortized over the life of the related assets.</font></div>

Eight of the ten applicants who submitted Part II applications remain active in the DOE program; however, the DOE has stated that the $18.5 billion currently appropriated to support new nuclear projects would not likely be enough for more than three projects.

Additionally, PPL has announced that it does not expect to proceed with construction absent favorable economics, a joint arrangement with other interested parties and a federal loan guarantee or other acceptable financing.  PPL and its subsidiaries are currently authorized by PPL's Board of Directors to spend up to $144 million on the COLA and other permitting costs (including land costs) necessary for construction.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $109 million and $77 million of costs associated with the licensing application were capitalized and are included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent "Other intangibles.
"  PPL believes it is probable that these costs are ultimately recoverable following NRC approval of the COLA either through construction of the new nuclear unit, transfer of the COLA rights to a joint venture, or sale of the COLA rights to another party.</font></div>

PJM determined that the line is needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur as early as 2012 on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM system.  PJM has directed PPL Electric to construct the portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland line in Pennsylvania and has directed Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company to construct the portion of the line in New Jersey, in each case by June 1, 2012.

The definitive sales agreement, which was executed in May 2009, included provisions that reduced the $135 million purchase price monthly, commencing September 1, 2009.  After adjusting for these price-reduction provisions, proceeds from the sale approximated $124 million.</font></div>

As a result, at June 30, 2009, net assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell, resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of $52 million ($34 million after tax).  At both September 30 and December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value (less cost to sell) was remeasured and additional impairments totaling $10 million ($3 million after tax) were recorded.  In addition, $2 million ($1 million after tax) of goodwill allocated to this business was written off in 2009.  PPL Energy Supply recorded a loss on the sale of $3 million during the first quarter of 2010 due to the price-reduction provisions.  The losses recognized in the third and fourth quarters
 of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 did not significantly impact earnings, as such amounts were substantially offset by tolling revenues from the Long Island generation assets during the same periods.  These amounts are included in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the Statements of Income.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 2009, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary completed the sale of the majority of its Maine hydroelectric generation business, which was included in the Supply segment, for $81 million in cash, adjusted for working capital.  The assets sold in this transaction included five hydroelectric facilities and a 50% equity interest in a sixth hydroelectric facility, which had been accounted for as an equity investment, together with rights to increase energy output at these facilities upon completion of the sale of the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary's three other hydroelectric facilities in Maine (see "Sale of the Remaining Maine Hydroelectric Generation Business" above).  As a result of the sale of the majority of the Maine hydroelectric generation business, PPL Energy Supply recorded a gain of $38 million ($22 million after tax), 
reflected in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the 2009 Statement of Income.  Additionally, in December 2010, the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary received $14 million in contingent consideration, which was tied to its completion of the sale of the three other hydroelectric facilities noted above.  PPL Energy Supply accordingly recorded a gain of $14 million ($8 million after tax), reflected in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the Statement of Income.</font></div>

PPL Energy Supply's interest in the plant was included in the Supply segment.  In connection with the sale, PPL Energy Supply recorded a loss of $6 million ($4 million after tax).  This charge is included in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the 2009 Statement of Income.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 2007, PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its regulated electricity delivery businesses in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia, which were included in the International Regulated segment.  In 2008, PPL Global recognized income tax benefits and miscellaneous expenses in Discontinued Operations in connection with the dissolution of certain Latin American holding companies.  This process was substantially completed in 2008.  In 2009, PPL Energy Supply identified a correction to the previously computed tax bases of the Latin American businesses.  The most significant adjustment related to the sale of the El Salvadoran business and was largely due to returns of capital in certain prior years that had not been reflected in the calculated tax basis.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply recorded $24 
million of additional income tax expense in 2009, which is reflected on the Statement of Income in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)."  The additional expense is not considered by management to be material to the 2009 financial statements.</font></div>

In 2007, WKE entered into an agreement to terminate the lease, which closed in 2009, prior to PPL acquiring LKE.  As part of the lease termination, WKE was obligated to pay a former customer, an aluminum smelter, an aluminum production payment in lieu of a lump-sum cash consent payment, as well as the difference between the electricity prices charged by WKE under the previous long-term sales contract and the electricity prices charged by the aluminum smelter's current electricity supplier.  This obligation was partially mitigated by the opportu
nity to make off-system sales, when economic, for the contractual demand not used by the aluminum smelter.  In addition, the total amount of the obligation to this smelter was limited to $82 million.  Any amount paid by WKE over the limit has been recorded as an interest-bearing receivable and is required to be repaid (plus interest) only if certain conditions occur by 2028.  Such exposure expired in January 2011.  In addition, because the former customer posted a letter of credit supporting payment to its current electricity supplier, WKE reversed a portion of the liability associated with its guarantee of payment by the former customer.  Also, WKE had an obligation to another aluminum smelter, also a former customer, to make an escrow payment of approximately $4 million, which was included in the liability at December 31, 2010, and was paid in January 2011.  The income statement impacts are included in the Kentucky Regulated segment and 
are reflected in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)"<font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> </font>on the Statements of Income.  See Note 15 for additional information related to the termination of the lease.  The results of operations for 2010 were insignificant.</font></div>

PPL completed the sale in October 2008 for $268 million in cash, adjusted for working capital at the sale date, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement.  Sale proceeds of $303 million, including estimated working capital, were contributed to PPL Energy Supply through its parent, PPL Energy Funding.  In 2008, PPL recorded impairment and other charges related to the sale totaling $10 million ($6 million after tax).  Also in 2008, PPL Gas Utilities paid a $3 million ($2 million after tax) premium to prepay the entire $10 million aggregate principal of its 8.70% Senior Notes due Decemb
er 2022.  In 2009, PPL recognized an insignificant charge in Discontinued Operations in connection with the settlement of the working capital adjustment.</font></div>

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the goodwill was assigned to the reportable segments expected to benefit from the acquisition.  Both the Kentucky Regulated and the Supply segments are expected to benefit and the assignment of goodwill was $662<font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"> </font>million to the Kentucky Regulated segment and $334 million to the Supply segment.  The goodwill at the Kentucky Regulated segment reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of LKE to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows.  Although no other assets or liabil
ities from the acquisition were assigned to the Supply segment, the Supply segment obtained a synergistic benefit attributed to the overall de-risking of the PPL portfolio, which enhanced PPL Energy Supply's credit profile, thereby increasing the value of the Supply segment.  This increase in value resulted in the assignment of goodwill to the Supply segment.  None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be included in regulated customer rates or deductible for income tax purposes.  As such, no deferred taxes were recorded related to goodwill.</font></div>

Adjustments included in the pro forma financial information include: (a) a pre-tax adjustment in 2010 of $165 million for non-recurring acquisition-related costs including the Bridge Facility in support of the acquisition, losses incurred in connection with the termination of interest rate swaps, and other third-party transaction costs; (b) a net decrease in interest expense from the repayment of affiliate indebtedness to subsidiaries of E.ON AG, and replacement with interest expense related to the November 2010 issuance of debt by LG&amp;E and KU Energy LLC, LG&amp;E and KU (the Kentucky Entities); and (c) the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments, which was calculated using an est
imated post-acquisition composite statutory income tax rate of 39%.  In addition, losses from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) of PPL and LKE of $18 million and $227 million in 2010 and 2009 were excluded from the pro forma amounts above.</font></div>

Such borrowings were incurred to permit LKE to repay certain indebtedness owed to affiliates of E.ON AG upon the closing of the acquisition.  In November 2010, PPL Energy Supply used the above-referenced amounts received from LKE, together with other cash on hand, to repay approximately $3.0 billion of its October 2010 borrowing under existing credit facilities.

Therefore, hedge accounting associated with interest rate swaps entered into by PPL in anticipation of a debt issuance by PPL Energy Supply was discontinued.  Net losses of $(29) million, or $(19) million after tax, were reclassified from AOCI to "Other Income (Expense) - net" on PPL's 2010 Statement of Income.</font></div>

Brown generating station.  In December 1999, after selling their interests in the combustion turbines, LG&amp;E and KU entered into an 18-year lease of the turbines.  At the same time, LG&amp;E and KU provided funds to fully defease the lease and executed an irrevocable notice to exercise an early purchase option contained in the lease after 15.5 years, which will occur in 2014.  The financial statement treatment of this transaction is the same as if LG&amp;E and KU had retained their ownership interest.  Since the lease was defeased, there are no remaining minimum lease payments and all related PP&amp;E is reflected on the Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010.  At December&#16
0;31, 2010, the Balance Sheet included assets of $104 million, which are reflected in "Regulated utility plant &#8211; electric and gas, net."  For 2010, the related accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense are insignificant.</font></div>

No events of default currently exist with respect to the lease.  Upon any termination of the lease, whether by default or expiration of its term, title to the combustion turbines reverts to LG&amp;E and KU.

This transaction is accounted for as a sale-leaseback and classified as an operating lease.  These leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets.  PPL Montana currently amortizes material leasehold improvements over no more than the remaining life of the original leases.  PPL Montana is required to pay all expenses associated with the operations of the generation units.  The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends and require
 PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios related to cash flow and net worth.  There are no residual value guarantees in these leases.  However, upon an event of default or an event of loss, PPL Montana could be required to pay a termination value of amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment and anticipated return on investment.  The events of default include payment defaults, breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness of PPL Montana, change in control of PPL Montana and certain bankruptcy events.  The termination value was estimated to be $763 million at December 31, 2010.</font></div>

In addition, each Plan limits the number of shares available for awards in any calendar year to 2% of the outstanding common stock of PPL on the first day of such calendar year.  The maximum number of options that can be awarded under each Plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is three million shares.

If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again

Performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance goal.  Performance is determined based on total shareowner return during a three-year performance period.  At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the total shareowner return of the companies included in an index group, in this case the S&amp;P Electric Utilities Index.  Awards are payable on a graduated basis within the following ranges:  if PPL's performance is at or above the 85th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 200% of the Target Award; at the 50th percentile of the index group, 
the award is paid at 100% of the Target Award; at the 40th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 50% of the Target Award; and below the 40th percentile, no award is payable.  Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the determination of the CGNC of whether the performance goals have been achieved.  Under the Plan provisions, performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units remain outstanding and eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance period.  The fair value of performance units granted is recognized over the three-year performance period.  Performance units vest on a pro rata basis if control of PPL changes, as defined by the Plan.</font></div>

The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a 3-year Treasury bond. Volatility over the expected term of three years is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and companies in the index group.</font></div>

PPL uses a risk-free interest rate, expected option life, historical volatility and dividend yield to value its stock options.  The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield for a U.S. Treasury Strip available on the date of grant with constant rate maturity approximating the option's expected life.  Expected life is calculated based on historical exercise behavior.  Volatility over the expected term of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL's volatility in those prior periods.  Management's expectations for future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL's business model a
nd other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data to determine the final volatility assumption.  The dividend yield is based on several factors, including PPL's most recent dividend payment, as of the grant date and the forecasted stock price through 2012.  The assumptions used in the model were:</font></div>

Board members are entitled to defer any or all of their fees and cash retainers that are not part of the mandatory deferral into stock units.

There were 424,170 such stock units outstanding at December 31, 2010, which were accounted for as liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently

Debt securities are generally measured using a market approach, including the use of matrix pricing.  Common inputs include reported trades; broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments.  When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as benchmark yields, credit valuation adjustments, reference data from market research publications, monthly payment data, collateral performance and new issue data.  For the PPL Services
 Corporation Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations as well as commingled fund investments that are measured against the JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index and the Barclays Long A or Better Index.  For the LG&amp;E and KU pension trusts, debt securities within comingled trusts are managed against the Barclays Aggregated Bond Index and the Barclays U.S. Government/Credit Long Index.  The debt securities held by the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust at December 31, 2010 have a weighted-average coupon of 4.25% and a weighted-average duration of 16 years.</font></div>

The manager is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants.  This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor.  Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared to more speculative real estate investing strategies.  The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions.  Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the p
artnership, including legal and tax implications, among others.  The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.</font></div>

Three of the partnerships have limited lives of ten years, while the fourth has a life of 15 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received.  Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment can not be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval.  The PPL Services Corporation Master Trust has unfunded commitments of $90 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships.

Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies.  The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under all market conditions.  Major investment strategies for both hedge fund of funds include long/short equity, market neutral, distressed debt, and relative value.  Generally, shares may be redeemed on 90 days prior written notice.  Both funds are subject to short term lockups and have limitations on the amount that may be withdrawn based on a percentage of the total net asset value of the fund, among other restrictions.  All withdrawals are subject to the general 
partner's approval.  One fund's fair value has been estimated using the net asset value per share and the other fund's fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.</font></div>

In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models.  These securities represent investments in To-be-announced debt securities and interest rate swaps.  To-be-announced debt securities are commitments to purchase debt securities and are used as a cost effective means of managing the duration of assets in the trust.  These commitments are valued by reviewing the issuing agency, program and coupon.  Interest rate swaps are valued based on the swap details such as: swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency and payer/recei

Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust and LG&amp;E and KU Energy LLC Pension Trusts, discussed in Plan Assets - U.S. Pensions Plans above, PPL's other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments.  These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers, and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk.  The only prohibited investments are investments in debt or equity securi
ties issued by PPL and its subsidiaries.  Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds.  Securities issued by commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by PPL as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.  Securities issued by commingled money market funds that invest entirely in money market securities are traded as equity units, but treated by PPL as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.  The asset allocation for the VEBA trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31, are detailed below.</font></div>

The trustees' primary focus is to ensure that assets are sufficient to meet members' benefits as they fall due with a longer term objective to reduce investment risk.  The investment strategy is intended to maximize investment returns while not incurring excessive volatility in the funding position.  WPD's plans are invested in a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers and therefore have no significant concentration of risk.  Commingled funds that consist entirely of debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by WPD as debt securities 
for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.  These include investments in U.K. corporate bonds and U.K. gilts.</font></div>

At December 31, 2009, the $11 million unamortized balance of this liability was included in "Other current liabilities" on the Balance Sheets and was fully amortized in 2010.</font></div>

In September 2010, L
KE and the construction contractor agreed to a settlement to resolve the force majeure and excusable event claims occurring through July 2010, under the TC2 construction contract, which settlement provided for a limited, negotiated extension of the contractual commercial operations date and/or relief from liquidated damage calculations.  With limited exceptions LKE took care, custody and control of TC2 on January 22, 2011, and has dispatched the unit to meet customer demand since that date.

This lawsuit followed dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of an earlier federal lawsuit seeking such compensation in the U.S. District Court of Montana.  Initially brought by two individuals, for whom the State was later substituted, the federal lawsuit alleged that the beds of Montana's navigable rivers became state-owned trust property upon Montana's admission to statehood, and that the use of them should, under a 1931 regulatory scheme enacted after all but one of the hydr
oelectric facilities in question were constructed, trigger lease payments for use of land beneath.  In July 2006, the Montana state court approved a stipulation by the State of Montana that it was not seeking compensation for the period prior to PPL Montana's December 1999 acquisition of the hydroelectric facilities.</font></div>

The error was a result of incorrect modeling of certain generation resources that have an impact on power flows across the PJM/MISO border.  Informal settlement discussions on this issue terminated in March 2010.  Also in March 2010, MISO filed two complaints with the FERC concerning the modeling error and related matters with a demand for $130 million of principal plus interest.  In April 2010, PJM filed answers to the complaints and filed a related complaint against MISO.  In its answers and complaint, PJM denies that any compensation is due to MISO and seeks recovery in excess of $25 million from MISO for alleged violations by MISO regarding market-to-
market power flow calculations.  PPL participates in markets in both PJM and MISO.  The amount and timing of any payments by PJM to MISO or by MISO to PJM relating to these modeling errors is uncertain, as is the method by which PJM or MISO would allocate any such payments to PJM and MISO participants.  In June 2010, the FERC ordered the complaints to be consolidated and set for settlement discussions, followed by hearings if the discussions are unsuccessful.  In January 2011, the parties to this dispute filed a settlement with the FERC under which no compensation would be paid to either PJM or MISO and providing for certain improvements in how the calculations are administered going forward.

Of particular relevance to PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that require most over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange and to be centrally cleared.  The Dodd-Frank Act, however, provides an exemption from mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.  Although the phrase "to hedge or mitigate commercial risk" is not defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, recent rules proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission set forth an inclusive, multi-pronged definition for the phrase.  Based on this proposed definition and other requirements in the proposed rule, it is anticipated that transacti
ons utilized by PPL and PPL Energy Supply should qualify if they are not entered into for speculative purposes.  The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral and margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions, including those that are used to hedge commercial risk.  However, during drafting of the Dodd-Frank Act, certain members of Congress adopted report language and issued a public letter stating that it was not their intention to impose margin and collateral requirements on counterparties that utilize these transactions to hedge commercial risk.  Final rules on major provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, including imposition of collateral and margin requirements, will be established through rulemakings and, in most cases, will not take effect until at least 12 months after the date of enactment.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply may be required to post additional collateral if they are subject to margin 
requirements as ultimately adopted in the implementing regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply will continue to evaluate the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and monitor developments related to its implementation.  At this time, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the impact that the new law or its implementing regulations will have on their business or operations, or the markets in which they transact business.</font></div>

This act gave customers the ability to choose their electric supplier and capped electric rates through December 2010.  KU subsequently received a legislative exemption from the customer choice requirements of this law.  In April 2007, however, the Virginia General Assembly amended the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act, terminating the competitive market and commencing re-regulation of utility rates.  The new act ended the cap on rates at the end of 2008.  Pursuant to this legislation, the VSCC adopted regulations revising the rules governing utility rate increase applications.  As of January 2009, a hybrid model of regulation is being applied in Virginia, under which utility r
ates are reviewed every two years.  KU's exemption from the requirements of the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act, however, discharges KU from the requirements of the new hybrid model of regulation.  In lieu of submitting an annual information filing, KU has the option of requesting a change in base rates to recover prudently incurred costs by filing a traditional base rate case.  KU is also subject to other utility regulations in Virginia, including, but not limited to, the recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs through an annual fuel factor charge and the submission of integrated resource plans.</font></div>

Act 129 requires EDCs to cause reduced electricity consumption of 1% by 2011 and 3% by 2013, and reduced peak demand of 4.5% by 2013.  EDCs will be able to recover the costs (capped at 2% of the EDC's 2006 revenue) of implementing their EE&amp;C Plans.  In October 2009, the PUC approved PPL Electric's EE&amp;C Plan.  The plan includes 14 programs, all of which are voluntary for customers.  The plan includes a proposed rate mechanism for recovery of all costs incurred by PPL Electric to implement the plan.  In September 2010, PPL Elect

Various responses were filed to that petition which the PUC has assigned to two Administrative Law Judges for hearings and a recommended decision.  In December 2010, the Administrative Law Judges issued a recommended decision approving PPL Electric's request.  Parties have filed exceptions and reply exceptions to the recommended decision.

All of PPL Electric's metered customers currently have smart meters installed at their service locations, and PPL Electric's current advanced metering technology generally satisfies the requirements of Act 129 and does not need to be replaced.  In June 2010, the PUC entered its order approving PPL Electric's smart meter plan with several modifications.  In compliance with the order, in the third quarter of 20

No. 2381, 214th Leg. (N.J. 2011) (the Act).  To create incentives for the development of new, in-state electric generation facilities, the Act implements a "long-term capacity agreement pilot program" (LCAPP).  The Act requires New Jersey utilities to pay a guaranteed fixed price for wholesale capacity, imposed by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), to certain new generators participating in PJM, with the ultimate costs of that guarantee to be borne by New Jersey ratepayers.  PPL believes the intent and effect of the LCAPP is to encourage the construction of new generation in New Jersey even when, under the FERC-approved PJM economic model, such new generation
 would not be economic.  The Act could depress capacity prices in PJM in the short term, impacting PPL Energy Supply's revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the PJM capacity market to incent necessary generation investment throughout PJM.  In February 2011, the PJM Power Providers Group (P3), an organization in which PPL is a member, filed a complaint before the FERC seeking changes in PJM's capacity market rules designed to ensure that subsidized generation, such as may result from the implementation of the LCAPP, will not be able to set capacity prices artificially low as a result of their exercise of buyer market power.

In June 2007, the FERC issued Order No. 697 implementing certain reforms to market-based rate regulations, including restrictions similar to those previously in place
 for LG&amp;E's and KU's power sales at control area interfaces.  In December 2008, the FERC issued Order No. 697-B potentially placing additional restrictions on certain power sales involving areas where market power is deemed to exist.  As a condition of receiving and retaining market-based rate authority, LG&amp;E and KU must comply with applicable affiliate restrictions set forth in the FERC regulation.</font></div>

If the FERC determines that the market is not workably competitive or that the seller possesses market power or is not charging "just and reasonable" rates, it may institute prospective action, but any contracts entered into pursuant to the FERC's market-based rate authority remain in effect and are generally subject to a high standard of review before the FERC can order changes.  Recent court decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have raised issues that may make it more difficult for the FERC to continue its program of promoting wholesale electricity competition through market-based rate authority.  These court decisions permit retroactive refunds and a 
lower standard of review by the FERC for changing power contracts, and could have the effect of requiring the FERC in advance to review most, if not all, power contracts.  In June 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed one of the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, thereby upholding the higher standard of review for modifying contracts.  The FERC has not yet taken action in response to these court decisions.  At this time, PPL cannot predict the impact of these court decisions on the FERC's future market-based rate authority program or on PPL's business.</font></div>

In its decision, the Tax Court ruled on two issues: (1) the 1997 U.K. WPT imposed on all U.K. privatized utilities, including PPL's U.K. subsidiary, was creditable against the Company's U.S. income taxes; and (2) PPL Electric's street lighting assets could be depreciated for tax purposes over seven years as permitted for "property without a class life" instead of the 20-year depreciation recovery period argued by the IRS.  While not certain, it appears that the IRS has recommended not to prosecute an appeal of the street lighting decision.  PPL filed its tax returns for 1997 and all int
ervening years on the basis that the WPT was creditable and that the appropriate tax depreciable life for its street lighting assets was seven years.  Therefore, the cash benefit resulting from these items has already been realized.  Prior to the Tax Court decision, the Company had accrued a tax reserve equivalent to the full amount of the tax and interest exposure for these two items.

The EPA has recently finalized a new one-hour standard for sulfur dioxide, and states are required to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in non-attainment.

Under the BART rule, PPL submitted to the Pennsylvania DEP its analyses of the visibility impacts of particulate matter emissions from Martins Creek Units 3 and 4, Brunner Island Units 2 and 3 and Montour Units 1 and 2.  No analysis was submitted for sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, because the EPA determined that meeting the requirements for CAIR also meets the BART requirements for those pollutants.  Although the EPA has not yet expressly stated that a similar approach will be taken under the Transport Rule, the EPA has not reques
ted any further studies.  PPL's analyses have shown that because PPL had already upgraded its particulate emissions controls at Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner Island Units 2 and 3, further controls are not justified as there would be little corresponding visibility improvement.  PPL has not received comments from the Pennsylvania DEP on these submissions.</font></div>

PPL completed a high level analysis of various control options to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter and submitted that analysis to EPA in January 2011.

The NSR regulations require major new or modified sources of regulated pollutants to receive pre-construction and operation permits with limits that prevent the significant deterioration of air pollution in areas that are in attainment of the ambient air quality standards for these pollutants.  In May 2010, the EPA published a final rule establishing thresholds for regulating GHG emissions from major new or modified sources.  Combined carbon dioxide emissions or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 100,000 tons or more per year will classify a source as maj
or for permitting applicability purposes.  The threshold for a major modification of a major source is an increase of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 75,000 tons per year.  If the modifications result in emissions increases exceeding 75,000 tons per year, the plant will need to conduct an analysis of best available control technology for GHG and meet limits based on best available control technology.  To date, the EPA has not provided final guidance on what constitutes best available control technology for GHG emissions, but has indicated in draft guidance that it may consider efficiency projects and other options as possible best available control technology for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.  In addition, in December 2010, the EPA announced that it intends to promulgate New Source Performance Standards addressing GHG emissions from new and existing power plants, with a proposed rule anticipated in July 2011 and a final rule in Ma
y 2012.  The implications of these developments, including the outcome of any litigation challenging the regulation, are uncertain.</font></div>

CCRs include fly ash, bottom ash and scrubber wastes.  In the one approach, the EPA would regulate CCRs as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA.  This approach would have very significant impacts on any coal-fired plant, and would require plants to retrofit their operations to comply with full hazardous waste requirements from the generation of CCRs and associated waste waters through transportation and disposal.  This would also have a negative impact on the beneficial use of CCRs and could eliminate the current markets.  The second approach would regulate CCRs as a solid waste under Subtitle D of RCRA. &#

This resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware River.  PPL determined that the release was caused by a failure in the disposal basin's discharge structure.  PPL conducted extensive clean-up and completed studies, in conjunction with a group of natural resource trustees and the Delaware River Basin Commission, evaluating the effects of the release on the river's sediment, water quality and ecosystem.</font></div>

In Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky, this arsenic standard has been incorporated into the states' water quality standards and could result in more stringent limits in NPDES permits for its Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky plants.  Recently, the EPA developed a draft risk assessment for arsenic that increases the cancer risk exposure by more than 20 times, which would lower the current standard from 10 ppb to 0.1 ppb.

Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K. have reviewed this issue.  The U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes, there is no evidence that EMFs cause adverse effects.  The agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without supporting laboratory evidence.  The U.K. National Radiological Protection Board (part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded in 2004 that
, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that EMFs cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond existing exposure guidelines.  The Stakeholder Group on Extremely Low Frequency EMF, set up by the U.K. Government, has issued two reports, one in April 2007 and one in June 2010, describing options for reducing public exposure to EMF.  The U.K. Government responded to the first report in 2009, agreeing to some of the proposals, including a proposed voluntary code to optimally phase 132 kilovolt overhead lines to reduce public exposure to EMF where it is cost effective to do so.  The U.K. Government is currently considering the second report which concentrates on EMF exposure from distribution systems.  PPL and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether EMFs cause adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce EMFs, where practical, in the design of new transmission and distri
bution facilities.  PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the EMF issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the U.S. or the U.K., and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might incur related to the EMF issue.</font></div>

The indemnification provision for the tax matters representations survives for the duration of the applicable statute of limitations, and the indemnification provision for the environmental matters representations survives for a period of three years after the transaction closing.  The indemnification relating to unknown environmental liabilities for manufactured gas plants and disposal sites outside of Pennsylvania could survive more than three years, but only with respect to applicable property or sites identified by the purchaser prior to the third anniversary of the transaction closing.

The most comprehensive of these guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the WKE Transaction Termination Agreement.  This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million.  Certain items such as non-excluded government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap.  Another guarantee with a maximum exposure of $100 million covering other indemnifications expires in 2023.  LKE is not aware of claims made by any party at this time, although one 
matter is currently in arbitration, the outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time.  See Note 9 for additional information.  Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates, including certain indemnifications of current officers with respect to its former Argentine businesses, for which LKE has received a cross-indemnity from a third party.  The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum amount limits range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; however, LKE is not aware of formal claims made by any party at this time.  LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party.

When observable inputs are used to measure all or most of the value of a contract, the contract is classified as Level 2.  Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are valued using quotes obtained from an exchange, binding and non-binding broker quotes, prices posted by ISOs or published tariff rates.  Furthermore, PPL obtains independent quotes from the market to validate the forward price curves.  OTC contracts include forwards, swaps, options and structured deals for electricity, gas, oil, and/or emission allowances and may be offset with similar positions in exchange-traded markets.  To
 the extent possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.  In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models.  For example, the fair value of a structured deal that delivers power to an illiquid delivery point may be measured by valuing the nearest liquid trading point plus the value of the basis between the two points.  The basis input may be from market quotes, FTR prices, or historical prices.</font></div>

Additionally, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements include adjustments for credit risk based on PPL's own creditworthiness (for net liabilities) and its counterparties' creditworthiness (for net assets).  PPL's credit department assesses all reasonably available market information and uses probabilities of default to calculate the credit adjustment.  PPL assumes that observable market prices include sufficient adjustments for liquidity and modeling risks, but for Level 3 fair value measurements, PPL also assesses the need for additional adjustments for liquidity or modeling risks.  The contracts classified as Level 3 represent contracts for which the delivery dates are beyond the
 dates for which independent prices are available or for certain power basis positions, which PPL generally values using historical settlement prices to project forward prices.</font></div>

The primary reasons for the transfers during 2010 and 2009 were changes in the availability of market information and changes in the significance of the unobservable portion of the contract.  As the delivery period of a contract becomes closer, market information may become available.  When this occurs, the model's unobservable inputs are replaced with observable market information.</font></div>

PPL and PPL Energy Supply use an income approach to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR and government security rates) and forward foreign currency exchange rates (e.g., GBP and Euro), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments.  In certain cases, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot practicably obtain mar

Circuit issued a ruling that invalidated the CAIR in its entirety, including its cap-and-trade program.  As a result of this decision, in 2008, PPL determined that all of the annual nitrogen oxide allowances purchased by PPL EnergyPlus pursuant to the CAIR were no longer required, had no value and, therefore, recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $33 million ($20 million after tax).  Further, in 2008, PPL EnergyPlus recorded an additional charge and corresponding reserve of $9 million pre-tax ($5 million after tax) related to its sale of certain annual nitrogen oxide allowance put options.  These charges, recorded in PPL and PPL Energy Supply's Supply segment, are included in "Other operation and maintenance" expense on the Stateme

Certain contracts qualify for NPNS or are non-derivatives and are therefore not reflected in the financial statements until delivery.  See Note 18 for additional information on NPNS.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply segregate their remaining non-trading activities into two categories:  cash flow hedge activity and economic activity.</font></div>

The cash flow hedges that existed at December 31, 2010 range in maturity through 2015.  At December 31, 2010, the accumulated net unrealized after-tax gains that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $300 million for PPL and PPL Energy Supply.  Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.  For 2010, such reclassifications were after-tax losses of 
$(89) million, primarily due to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts, for which the associated hedges are no longer required, as discussed above.  For 2009 and 2008, such reclassifications were an after-tax gain of $9 million and an after-tax loss of $(8) million.</font></div>

Certain power and gas cash flow hedge positions failed effectiveness testing during 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.  However, these positions were not dedesignated as hedges, as prospective regression analysis demonstrated that these hedges were expected to be highly effective over their term.  For 2008, an after-tax gain of $298 million was recognized in earnings as a result of these hedge failures.  During 2009, fewer power and gas cash flow hedges failed hedge effectiveness testing; therefore, a portion of the previously recognized u
nrealized gains recorded in 2008 associated with these hedges were reversed.  For 2009, after-tax losses of $(215) million were recognized in earnings as a result of these reversals.  During the first quarter of 2010, after-tax losses of $(82) million were recognized in earnings as a result of these reversals continuing.   Effective April 1, 2010, clarifying accounting guidance was issued that precludes the reversal of previously recognized gains/losses resulting from hedge failures.  By the end of the first quarter of 2010, all previously recorded hedge ineffectiveness gains resulting from hedge failures were reversed, thus the new accounting guidance did not have a significant impact at adoption on April 1, 2010. See Note 1 for more information on this accounting change.</font></div>

PPL Energy Supply also uses options, which include the sale of call options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating unit.  Since the physical generating capacity is owned, the price exposure is limited to the cost of the particular generating unit and does not expose PPL Energy Supply to uncovered market price risk.

 also purchases call options or sells put options to create a net purchase position to cover an overall short position in the non-trading portfolio.</font></div>

The full-requirement sales contracts and their related supply contracts make up a significant component of the marketing portfolio.  The obligations under the full-requirement sales contracts include supplying a bundled product of energy, capacity, RECs, and other ancillary products.  The full-requirement sales contracts PPL Energy Supply is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load, and actual load could vary significantly from forecasted amounts.  PPL Energy Supply uses a variety of strategies to hedge its full-requirement sales contracts, including purchasing energy at a liquid trading hub 
or directly at the load delivery zone, purchasing capacity and RECs in the market and supplying the energy, capacity and RECs with its generation.  RECs are not derivatives and are excluded from the table below.  The following table presents the volumes of (sales)/purchase contracts, excluding FTRs, basis and capacity contracts, used in support of these activities at December 31, 2010.</font></div>

PPL and PPL Energy Supply may enter into financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances.  For PPL, these interest rate swap contracts range in maturity through 2041 and had a notional value of $500 million at December 31, 2010.  For 2010, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives resulted in a net after-tax loss of $(9) million.  For 2009 and 2008, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives was not significant.  No contracts were outstanding at PPL Energy Supply at December 31, 2010.</fon

Most of these provisions would require PPL or PPL Energy Supply to transfer additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade.  Some of these provisions also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each decrease in the credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade.  In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below i
nvestment grade (i.e., below BBB- for S&amp;P or Fitch, or Baa3 for Moody's), and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent provisions require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization by PPL or PPL Energy Supply on derivative instruments in net liability positions.</font></div>

A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity.  This would typically involve negotiations among the parties.  However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with "adequate assurance" provisions.</font></div>

At December 31, 2010, if the credit contingent provisions underlying these derivative instruments were triggered due to a credit downgrade below investment grade, PPL and PPL Energy Supply would have been required to prepay or post additional collateral of $186 million and $171 million to their counterparties including net receivables and payables already recor

PPL and PPL Energy Supply management were unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates for the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at certain of the generation plants.  If economic events or other circumstances change that enable PPL and PPL Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that time.</font></div>

In the third quarter of 2010, PPL Susquehanna completed a site-specific study to update the estimated cost to dismantle and decommission each Susquehanna nuclear unit immediately following final shutdown.  This estimate included decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal of non-radiological structures and materials.  Based on this study, which used a methodology consistent with the prior site-specific study done in 2002, the decommissioning ARO liability and the associated long-lived asset were reduced by $103 million.  The primary factor for this decline was the lower estimated inflation rate assumption used in the 2010 ARO calculatio
n.</font></div>

The fair value of investments that are legally restricted for the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant was $618 million and $548 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and is included in "Nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds" on the Balance Sheets.

In 2010, PPL Energy Supply revised cost estimates at several plants, the most significant being the Susquehanna nuclear plant discussed above and the ash basins at Montour and Martins Creek.  In 2009, PPL Energy Supply revised cost estimates for several AROs and recognized additional asbestos liabilities at several plants, the most significant being the asbestos AROs at the Montour plant.  The effect of these new and revised liabilities was to increase the ARO liability and related plant balances by $7 
million in 2010 and $25 million in 2009.  The 2010 and 2009 income statement impact of these changes was insignificant.</font></div>

Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.  The owner/lessor of this generation facility, LMB Funding, LP, was created to own/lease the facility and incur the related financing costs.  The initial lease term commenced on the date of commercial operation, which occurred in May 2004, and ends in December 2013.  Under a residual value guarantee, if the generation facility is sold at the end of the lease term and the cash proceeds from the sale are less than the original acquisition cost, the subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply is obligated to pay up to 70.52% of the origina
l acquisition cost.  This residual value guarantee protects the other variable interest holders from losses related to their investments.  LMB Funding, LP cannot extend or cancel the lease or sell the facility without the prior consent of the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary.  As a result, LMB Funding, LP was determined to be a VIE and the subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply was considered the primary beneficiary that consolidates this VIE.</font></div>

The debt matures at the end of the initial lease term.  As a result of the consolidation, PPL Energy Supply has recorded interest expense in lieu of rent expense.  For 2010, 2009 and 2008, additional depreciation on the generation facility of $16 million, $11 million and $11 million was recorded.</font></div>

The recovery included a return on unamortized decommissioning costs.  Under the power supply agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, these revenues were passed on to PPL EnergyPlus.  Similarly, these revenues were passed on to PPL Susquehanna under a power supply agreement between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Susquehanna.</font></div>

The NRC requires that nuclear decommissioning trusts be managed by independent investment managers, with discretion to buy and sell securities in the trusts.  As a result, PPL and PPL Energy Supply have been unable to demonstrate the ability to hold an impaired security until it recovers its value; therefore, unrealized losses on debt securities through March 31, 2009 and unrealized losses on equity securities for all periods presented, represented other-than-temporary impairments that required a current period charge to earnings.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded impairments for certain
 securities invested in the NDT funds of $3 million, $18 million and $36 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008.  These impairments are reflected on the Statements of Income in "Other-Than-Temporary Impairments."</font></div>

However, if there is no intent to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not that they will be required to sell the security before recovery, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the other-than-temporary impairment will be separated into the credit loss component, which is recognized in earnings, and the remainder of the other-than-temporary impairment, which is recorded in OCI.  Temporary impairments of debt securities and unrealized gains on both debt and equity securitie
s are recorded to OCI.  There were no credit losses on debt securities held in the NDT funds at December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.</font></div>

The estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the indemnifications at December 31, 2010 was $300 million.  The indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties, including tax and environmental matters, are capped at $45 million, in the aggregate, and are triggered (i) only if the individual claim exce
eds $50,000, and (ii) only if, and only to the extent that, in the aggregate, total claims exceed $4.5 million.  The indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired on September 30, 2009 without any claims having been made.  Certain representations and warranties, including those having to do with transaction authorization and title, survive indefinitely, are capped at the purchase price and are not subject to the above threshold or deductible.  The indemnification provision for the tax matters representations survives for the duration of the applicable statute of limitations, and the indemnification provision for the environmental matters representations survives for a period of three years after the transaction closing.  The indemnification relating to unknown environmental liabilities for manufactured gas plants and disposal sites outside of Pennsylvania could survive more than three years, but only with respect to applicable property or s
ites identified by the purchaser prior to the third anniversary of the transaction closing.  The indemnification for covenants survives until the applicable covenant is performed and is not subject to any cap.</font></div>

As a result of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL has established specific categories of services and authorization levels.

 by the Chair of the Audit Committee of PPL, who serves as the Committee designee to review and approve audit and non-audit related services during the year.
