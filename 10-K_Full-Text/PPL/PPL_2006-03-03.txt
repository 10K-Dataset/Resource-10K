PPL
      EnergyPlus buys and sells energy at competitive prices. PPL EnergyPlus purchases
      electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level, and also sells electric
      capacity and energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs.
      PPL
      EnergyPlus enters into these agreements to market available energy and capacity
      from PPL Generation's assets and to profit from market price fluctuations.
      PPL
      EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios to maximize the value of PPL's
      generating assets and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. PPL EnergyPlus
      also purchases and sells energy forward and futures contracts as well as other
      commodity-based financial instruments in accordance with PPL's risk management
      policies, objectives and strategies.

PPL
      EnergyPlus has executed contracts to provide electricity to PPL Electric
      sufficient for it to meet its PLR obligation through 2009, at the predetermined
      capped rates PPL Electric is entitled to charge its customers during this
      period. This arrangement with PPL Electric accounted for 35% of PPL Energy
      Supply's operating revenues in 2005. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements
      for
      more information concerning these contracts.

PPL
      EnergyPlus has a PUC license to act as an EGS in Pennsylvania. This license
      permits PPL EnergyPlus to offer retail electric supply to customers throughout
      Pennsylvania. In 2005, PPL EnergyPlus was licensed to provide, and provided
      energy to industrial and commercial customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
      Montana. PPL EnergyPlus also is licensed to provide energy in Delaware,
      Maryland, Maine and Massachusetts. PPL EnergyPlus currently is not marketing

Pennsylvania
                Delivery Segment -

Includes
                the regulated electric and gas delivery operations of PPL Electric
                and PPL
                Gas Utilities.

PPL
                Electric

PPL
      Electric provides electricity delivery service to approximately 1.4 million
      customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and
      central Pennsylvania. The largest cities in this territory are Allentown,
      Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Hazleton, Lancaster, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and
      Williamsport.

In
      addition to providing electricity delivery service in its service territory
      in
      Pennsylvania, PPL Electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers
      in that territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. As part of the PUC
      Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to provide this electricity supply at
      predetermined capped rates through 2009. PPL Electric has executed two contracts
      to purchase electricity from PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to
      meet
      its PLR obligation through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates. PPL
      Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant
      to
      rules that have not yet been promulgated.

During
      2005, about 95% of PPL Electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated
      electricity deliveries and supply as a PLR. About 5% of 2005 operating revenues
      were from wholesale sales, primarily the sale to PPL EnergyPlus of power
      purchased from NUGs. During 2005, about 43% of electricity delivery and PLR
      revenues were from residential customers, 36% from commercial customers, 20%
      from industrial customers and 1% from other customer classes.

PPL
      Electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of PJM, which operates
      the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-Atlantic
      and Midwest regions of the U.S. Bulk electricity is transmitted to wholesale
      users throughout a geographic area including all or part of Delaware, Illinois,
      Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,
      Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
      As of January 1, 2006, PPL Electric became a member of the RFC. The purpose
      of
      RFC is to preserve and enhance electric service reliability and security for
      the
      interconnected electric systems within its territory and to be a regional entity
      under the framework of the North America Electric Reliability Council (NERC).
      RFC's key functions are the development of regional standards for reliable
      planning and operation of the bulk electric system and non-discriminatory
      compliance monitoring and enforcement of both NERC and regional standards.

PJM
      serves as a FERC-approved RTO in order to accommodate greater competition and
      broader participation in the region. An RTO, like an ISO, is a designation
      provided by the FERC to a FERC-approved independent entity that operates the
      transmission system and typically administers a competitive power market. A
      primary purpose of the RTO/ISO is to separate the operation of, and access
      to,
      the transmission grid from PJM electric utilities' generation interests. PJM
      also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.
      Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets, but the RTO/ISO
      directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. PPL Electric
      fully recovers from retail customers the charges that it pays to PJM for
      transmission-related services. PJM imposes these charges pursuant to its
      FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff.

PPL
      Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain
      of
      its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal
      Power Act.

PPL
      Electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional,
      state
      and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental
      matters. Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the Occupational
      Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.

In
      November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards
      legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as PPL
      Electric, and electric generation suppliers serving retail load to provide
      18%
      of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from alternative
      sources within 15 years (by 2020). Under this new state legislation, alternative
      sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells.
      An electric distribution company will pay an alternative compliance payment
      of
      $45 for each MWh that it is short of its required alternative energy supply
      percentage. Since PPL Electric's PLR generation rates are capped through 2009
      as
      described above and the legislation allows for a cost recovery exemption period,
      PPL Electric will not be subject to the requirements of this legislation until
      2010. In that year, PPL Electric will have to supply about 9% of the total
      amount of electricity it delivers to its PLR customers from alternative energy
      sources. At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the impact of this
      legislation on its future results of operations because the impact will depend
      on a number of factors that will not be known until 2010, including customer
      load requirements, PLR contract terms and available alternative energy sources
      in the market.

PPL
                Gas Utilities

PPL
      Gas
      Utilities was formed in 1946, and PPL acquired the company in 1998. PPL Gas
      Utilities operates a natural gas distribution and propane business in portions
      of various counties in Pennsylvania, as well as in a small portion of Maryland
      and Delaware, providing natural gas and propane services to approximately
      110,000 customers. PPL Gas Utilities provides its natural gas services in
      Pennsylvania subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC. PPL Gas
      Utilities also provides intrastate and interstate natural gas storage service
      from storage fields in Pennsylvania. The intrastate storage service is regulated
      by the PUC and the interstate storage service is regulated by the FERC. However,
      by order of the FERC issued in 1992, rates for interstate storage services
      are
      the rates set by the PUC for intrastate service. The propane delivery service
      is
      not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC or the FERC.

International
                Delivery Segment -

Through
                PPL Global, owns and operates international energy businesses that
                are
                focused on the distribution of
                electricity.

PPL
      Global provides electricity delivery service to approximately 3.7 million
      customers in the U.K. and Latin America.

In
      the
      U.K., WPD, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates two electric
      distribution companies that together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users.
      WPD delivered 28,884 million kWh of electricity in 2005.

PPL
      Global also has controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution
      companies serving customers in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia. Emel, of which
      PPL Global owns 95.4%, serves approximately 558,000 customers through subsidiary
      distribution companies in northern Chile and just south of its headquarters
      in
      Santiago, Chile. DelSur, of which PPL Global owns 86.4%, is an electric
      distribution company headquartered in San Salvador, which serves approximately
      277,000 customers in the central and southern regions of El Salvador, including
      a portion of the city of San Salvador. Elfec, of which PPL Global owns 92.1%,
      is
      the second largest electric distribution company in Bolivia, and serves
      approximately 269,000 customers in the Cochabamba region. In the recent past,
      Bolivia has experienced political and social unrest. At this time, PPL is unable
      to predict the potential effect on its Bolivian operations.

PPL
      Global also has a minority investment in a combined generating and natural
      gas
      production facility in Peru. In January 2006, PPL Global entered into an
      agreement to sell its minority interest in this investment.

In
      August
      2002, PPL Global deconsolidated its 90% equity interest in its Brazilian
      investment, CEMAR, when ANEEL authorized an administrative intervention and
      fully assumed operational and financial control of the company. In April 2004,
      PPL Global sold its investment in CEMAR. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements
      for additional information on the CEMAR investment.

Seasonality

Demand
      for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather. As a result,
      PPL's
      overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a
      seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat
      waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern
      of
      this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the
      facilities PPL owns and the terms of the contracts to purchase or sell
      electricity.

      capital expenditure requirements for the years 2006-2010. See Note 14 to the
      Financial Statements for additional information concerning expected capital
      expenditures for environmental matters.

COMPETITION

The
      unregulated businesses and markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate
      are highly competitive. The electric industry has experienced an increase in
      the
      level of competition in the energy markets due to federal and state deregulation
      initiatives. For instance, in 1992, the Energy Act amended the Federal Power
      Act
      to provide open access to electric transmission systems for wholesale
      transactions. In 1996, the Customer Choice Act was enacted in Pennsylvania
      to
      restructure the state's electric utility industry in order to create retail
      access to a competitive market for the generation of electricity. Certain other
      states in which PPL's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer choice"
      plans to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier. PPL and its
      subsidiaries believe that competition in deregulated energy markets will
      continue to be intense. In "Item 1A. Risk Factors," see

"We
      face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
      affect our ability to operate profitably,"

and

"If
      the present trend towards competition is reversed, discontinued or delayed,
      our
      business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely
      affected"

for more
      information concerning the risks PPL faces with respect to competition in the
      deregulated energy markets.

Pursuant
      to PPL Electric's authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
      the
      PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service
      area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its distribution
      business. Although the majority of PPL Global's international electricity
      transmission and distribution companies operate in non-exclusive concession
      areas in their respective countries, these companies currently face little
      or no
      competition with respect to residential customers. See "Franchises and Licenses"
      for more information.

POWER
      SUPPLY

PPL
      Generation's system capacity (winter rating) at December 31, 2005,
      was:

The
      capacity of generating units is based upon a number of factors, including the
      operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised
      periodically to reflect changed circumstances.

During
      2005, PPL Generation's plants generated the following amounts of
      electricity.

This
      generation represented a 2% increase over the output for 2004. Of this
      generation, 55% of the energy was generated by coal-fired stations, 30% from
      nuclear operations at the Susquehanna station, 8% from oil/gas-fired stations
      and 7% from hydroelectric stations.

PPL
      estimates that, on average, approximately 84% of its expected annual generation
      output for the period 2006 through 2009 will be sufficient to meet:

·

PPL
                EnergyPlus' obligation under two contracts to provide electricity
                for PPL
                Electric to satisfy its PLR obligation under the Customer Choice
                Act;

·

PPL
                EnergyPlus' obligation under two contracts to provide electricity
                to
                NorthWestern through June 2007; and

·

other
                contractual sales to other counterparties for terms of various
                lengths.

Due
      to
      the expiration of the PLR contracts at the end of 2009, PPL currently estimates
      that approximately 5% of its expected generation output for 2010 is needed
      to
      fulfill obligations under its existing power sales contracts.

Consistent
      with PPL's business strategy noted above, PPL expects that it will enter into
      new power sales contracts over the next few years as its existing long-term
      contracts expire. Based on the way in which the wholesale markets have developed
      over the last several years, PPL expects that these new contracts may be of
      a
      shorter duration than the PLR contracts, which at inception had terms of
      approximately nine years.

See
      Note
      14 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding PPL's wholesale
      energy commitments and Note 15 for more information regarding the PLR contracts.
      These contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are an integral part
      of,
      PPL's strategy for its energy supply business, which includes the matching
      of
      PPL's anticipated energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts
      of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties, to capture profits while
      effectively managing PPL's exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices
      and
      counterparty credit risk.

FUEL
      SUPPLY

Coal

Pennsylvania

PPL
      Coal
      Supply provides coal to Iris Energy, LLC for the production of synthetic fuel.
      In 2005, synthetic fuel from Iris Energy provided 57% of the fuel requirements
      for three Pennsylvania power plants operated by PPL Generation. The contract
      to
      provide coal to Iris Energy terminates at the end of 2007. PPL Coal Supply
      provides the balance of the plants' coal requirements. PPL Coal Supply actively
      manages its supply base by purchasing coal principally from mines located in
      central Appalachia and western and central Pennsylvania.

During
      2005, PPL Coal Supply purchased about 92% of the coal delivered to PPL
      Generation's wholly owned Pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term
      contracts and obtained 8% through spot market purchases. These contracts
      provided PPL Coal Supply with about 7.4 million tons of coal. Contracts
      currently in place are expected to provide approximately 8.1 million tons in
      2006. At December 31, 2005, the wholly owned Pennsylvania plants had sufficient
      supply for about 39 days of operations. The amount of coal in inventory varies
      from time to time depending on market conditions and plant
      operations.

Also
      at
      December 31, 2005, a PPL Generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in the
      Keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station. The owners
      of
      the Keystone station have a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel supplier
      to
      provide up to 4.3 million tons in 2006. This contract terminates at the end
      of
      2007. The Keystone station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for the balance
      of
      its requirements. The owners of the Conemaugh station have a long-term contract
      with a synthetic fuel supplier to provide a minimum of 2.4 million tons through
      2007. The balance of the Conemaugh station requirements is purchased under
      contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC.

Montana

PPL
      Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30%
      leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3. PPL Montana is party to contracts to
      purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined quality characteristics
      and
      specifications. The coal supply contract for Units 1 and 2 is in effect through
      December 31, 2009. The coal supply contract for Unit 3 is in effect through
      December 31, 2019.

Coal
      supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality
      characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette station. The
      contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements in 2005. Similar
      contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of the expected coal
      requirements through 2008.

Oil
      and Natural Gas

PPL
      Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. PPL
      EnergyPlus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural gas supply for
      all
      PPL Generation operations. During 2005, 100% of the physical oil requirements
      for the Martins Creek units were purchased on the spot market. As of December
      31, 2005, PPL EnergyPlus had no long-term agreements for these oil
      requirements.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to
      purchase natural gas for University Park.

PPL
      EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected
      pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility, but has no
      long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas.

PPL
      EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 45% of the expected
      pipeline transportation requirements of the Griffith facility, but has no
      long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas.

PPL
      EnergyPlus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place
      for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel
      facility, but has no long-term supply agreement to purchase natural
      gas.

Nuclear

The
      nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the
      mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the
      conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component;
      the
      enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for
      insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final
      disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

PPL
      Susquehanna has in effect a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying
      expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. These contracts
      are
      expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first
      quarter of 2010 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2011. PPL
      Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued
      operation of the nuclear units.

Federal
      law requires the federal government to provide for the permanent disposal of
      commercial spent nuclear fuel. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the
      DOE initiated an analysis of a site in Nevada for a permanent nuclear waste
      repository. There is no definitive date by which this repository will be
      operational. As a result, it was necessary to expand Susquehanna's on-site
      spent
      fuel storage capacity. To support this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted
      for
      the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry
      cask
      fuel storage technology. The facility is modular, so that additional storage
      capacity can be added as needed. The facility began receiving spent nuclear
      fuel
      in 1999. PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity
      in
      the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at
      Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017,
      under current operating conditions. If necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage
      facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are
      obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel
      storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be
      discharged through the current licensed life of the plant.

In
      2002,
      President Bush approved the Congressional override of a veto by the State of
      Nevada, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the site for development of a
      permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste. The next step is for
      the
      DOE to submit a license application to the NRC to build and then operate the
      Yucca Mountain repository. The DOE has not announced a date when that license
      application will be submitted.

In
      1996,
      the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the
      NWPA imposed on DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear
      fuel on or before January 31, 1998. In 1997, the Court ruled that the contracts
      between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially adequate remedy if
      the
      DOE failed to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. The
      DOE
      did not, in fact, begin to dispose of spent nuclear fuel on that date. The
      DOE
      continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable
      damages. On January 22, 2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court
      of
      Federal Claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach
      of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. PPL Susquehanna's
      lawsuit currently remains stayed, pending developments in lawsuits filed by
      other plaintiffs. PPL cannot predict the outcome of these
      proceedings.

ENVIRONMENTAL
      MATTERS

Certain
      PPL subsidiaries, including PPL Electric and PPL Generation subsidiaries, are
      subject to certain present and developing federal, regional, state and local
      laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other
      environmental matters. See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial Condition
      -
      Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information concerning
      environmental expenditures during 2005 and their estimate of those expenditures
      during the years 2006-2010. Certain environmental laws, regulations and
      developments that may have a substantial impact on PPL are discussed below.
      See
      "Environmental Matters" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for information
      regarding these laws and regulations and the status of PPL's and its
      subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as legal and
      regulatory proceedings, involving PPL and its subsidiaries.

Air

The
      Clean
      Air Act includes, among other things, provisions that: (a) restrict the
      construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and substantially
      modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b) authorize the
      EPA
      to impose substantial noncompliance penalties of up to $32,500 per day of
      violation for each facility found to be in violation of the requirements of
      an
      applicable state implementation plan. The state agencies administer the EPA's
      air quality regulations through the state implementation plans and have
      concurrent authority to impose penalties for non-compliance.

In
      2005,
      the EPA finalized its Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) requiring substantial
      reductions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in 28 midwestern
      and
      eastern states, including Pennsylvania. Pursuant to a separate rule finalized
      in
      2005, the EPA is requiring mercury reductions nationwide. Pennsylvania and
      Montana, where PPL owns coal-fired electric generating units, are considering
      mercury regulations more stringent than the federal rule, and Pennsylvania
      is
      considering an initiative by the Ozone Transport Commission that would be more
      stringent than the CAIR. In addition, there is mounting pressure from various
      states and environmental groups and at the federal level for mandatory carbon
      dioxide reductions. For example, several states have already passed legislation
      capping carbon emissions and bills have been introduced at the federal level
      proposing mandatory reductions. Also in 2005, seven northeast states (excluding
      Pennsylvania) signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a mandatory
      cap
      and trade program to stabilize and then reduce carbon dioxide emissions from
      their electric generating plants. It is not yet clear whether this program
      or a
      similar program will be extended to or adopted by Pennsylvania.

Water

To
      implement the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,
      as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,
      the
      EPA has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric stations.
      The states administer the EPA's effluent standards through state laws and
      regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges and water
      quality. The standards adopted by the EPA pursuant to the Clean Water Act may
      have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain PPL subsidiaries,
      depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments to
      regulations.

Pursuant
      to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977, the Office of Surface Mining
      (OSM) has adopted effluent guidelines which are applicable to PPL subsidiaries
      as a result of their past coal mining and coal processing activities. The EPA
      and the OSM limitations, guidelines and standards also are enforced through
      the
      issuance of NPDES permits. In accordance with the provisions of the Clean Water
      Act and the Reclamation Act of 1977, the EPA and the OSM have authorized the
      states to implement the NPDES program. Compliance with applicable water quality
      standards is assured by state imposition of NPDES permit conditions and
      requirements to address acid mine drainage.

Solid
      and Hazardous Waste

The
      provisions of Superfund authorize the EPA to require past and present owners
      of
      contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site
      to
      clean-up the site or pay the EPA or the state for the costs of clean-up. The
      generators and past owners can be liable even if the generator contributed
      only
      a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the site. Present owners can
      be
      liable even if they contributed no hazardous substances to the
      site.

State
      laws such as the Pennsylvania and Montana Superfund statutes also give state
      agencies broad authority to identify hazardous or contaminated sites and to
      order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the sites. If responsible
      parties cannot or will not perform the clean-up, the agency can hire contractors
      to clean-up the sites and then require reimbursement from the responsible
      parties after the clean-up is completed. Another Pennsylvania statute, the
      Land
      Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards, encourages voluntary
      clean-ups by allowing responsible parties to choose from a menu of clean-up
      standards and providing liability protection commensurate with the clean-up
      standard chosen.

Certain
      federal and state statutes, including federal and state Superfund statutes,
      also
      impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged
      natural resources.

Low-Level
      Radioactive Waste

Under
      federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive
      waste generated in that state. States may join in regional compacts to jointly
      fulfill their responsibilities. The states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware
      and West Virginia are members of the Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive
      Waste Compact. Efforts to develop a regional disposal facility in Pennsylvania
      were suspended by the Pennsylvania DEP in 1998. The Commonwealth retains the
      legal authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it
      be
      necessary. Low-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation of the
      Susquehanna facility is currently being sent to Barnwell, South Carolina, and
      Clive, Utah, for disposal. In the event these or other emergent disposal options
      become unavailable or no longer cost-effective, the low-level radioactive waste
      will be stored on-site at Susquehanna. PPL Susquehanna cannot predict the future
      availability of low-level waste disposal facilities or the cost of such
      disposal.

Asbestos

There
      have been increasing litigation claims throughout the U.S. based on exposure
      to
      asbestos against companies that manufacture or distribute asbestos products
      or
      that have these products on their premises. Certain of PPL's generation
      subsidiaries and certain of its energy services subsidiaries, such as those
      that
      have supplied, may have supplied or installed asbestos material in connection
      with the repair or installation of process piping and heating, ventilating
      and
      air conditioning systems, have been named as defendants in asbestos-related
      lawsuits. PPL cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or whether additional
      claims may be asserted against its subsidiaries in the future. PPL does not
      expect that the ultimate resolution of the current lawsuits will have a material
      adverse effect on its financial condition.

Electric
      and Magnetic Fields

Concerns
      have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
      effects of power frequency electric and/or magnetic fields (EMFs), which are
      emitted by all devices carrying electricity, including electric transmission
      and
      distribution lines and substation equipment. Government officials in the U.S.
      and the U.K. have reviewed this issue.

The
      U.S.
      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that,
      for
      most health outcomes, there is no evidence of EMFs causing adverse effects.
      The
      agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an
      association with childhood leukemia, but that this evidence is difficult to
      interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. The U.K. National Radiological
      Protection Board concluded in 2004 that, while the research on EMFs does not
      provide a basis to find that EMFs cause any illness, there is a basis to
      consider precautionary measures beyond existing exposure guidelines.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether EMFs cause
      adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce EMFs,
      where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities.
      PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the EMF
      issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the U.S. or
      abroad, and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might incur
      related to the EMF issue.

General

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving
      environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities
      and operations. In complying with statutes, regulations and actions by
      regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of water
      and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic
      substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease
      operating certain of their facilities. PPL's subsidiaries may also incur
      significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are
      not
      now determinable, but could be significant.

FRANCHISES
      AND LICENSES

PPL
      Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout
      its
      service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
      corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded
      and
      as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right
      to
      enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain
      conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution,
      permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political
      subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

See
      "Background - Supply Segment" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses
      in
      various states. PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the DOE to sell
      capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.

PPL
      Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating licenses. PPL
      Susquehanna intends to file with the NRC in 2006 for license renewals for each
      of the Susquehanna units to extend their expirations by 20 years, from 2022
      to
      2042 for Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2.

PPL
      Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to
      a
      license renewed by the FERC in 1980 and expiring in 2014. PPL Holtwood operates
      the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed
      by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044. PPL Holtwood also owns one-third
      of
      the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation (Safe Harbor), which
      holds a project license that extends the operation of its hydroelectric
      generating station until 2030. The total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating
      station is 418 MW, and PPL Holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of
      the
      total capacity.

The
      hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from Montana Power
      in 1999 are licensed by the FERC. These licenses expire periodically, and the
      generating facilities must be relicensed at such times. The FERC license for
      the
      Mystic facility expires in 2009; the Thompson Falls and Kerr licenses expire
      in
      2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine Missouri-Madison
      facilities expire in 2040. PPL Montana currently is working to have the Mystic
      facility relicensed.

In
      connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, FERC may, under
      applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee,
      or
      the U.S. government may take over the facility. If the original licensee is
      not
      relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to
      exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other
      property affected by the lack of relicensing.

PPL
      Global's international electricity transmission and distribution companies
      are
      authorized by the governments of their respective countries to provide electric
      distribution services within their concession areas and service territories,
      subject to certain conditions and obligations. For instance, each of these
      companies is subject to governmental regulation on the prices that it can charge
      and the quality of service it must provide, and the companies can be fined
      or
      even have their licenses or concessions revoked if they do not meet the mandated
      quality of service.

WPD
      operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by Ofgem.
      The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue is normally
      determined every five years. The most recent review was completed in late-2004,
      and new prices became effective April 1, 2005.

Emel
      is
      subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by Chile's National Energy Commission.
      The components of the distribution tariffs are energy and capacity prices,
      a
      transmission surcharge and the value added on account of distribution costs
      (VAD). The VAD includes a targeted return on invested capital of 10% per year.
      The energy and capacity prices are a direct pass-through to regulated customers
      of the energy charge that Emel pays to the generation companies. The tariffs
      are
      calculated every four years. The most recent tariff review was completed and
      revised rates became effective as of November 2004.

DelSur
      is
      subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by El Salvador's General Superintendent
      of Electricity and Telecommunications. The three components of the distribution
      tariff are an energy price, a commercialization charge and a distribution
      charge. DelSur's tariff specifies the energy price as a trailing six-month
      average of the spot market price. The tariffs are calculated every five years
      and are adjusted for inflation on January 1 of each year. The next comprehensive
      tariff review will take place in 2007 and be effective in 2008.

Elfec
      is
      subject to regulated maximum tariffs set by Bolivia's Superintendent of
      Electricity. Tariffs are calculated every four years based on the trailing
      three-year average of the equity returns from companies listed in the Dow Jones
      Utility Index. Tariffs are adjusted on a monthly basis for local inflation
      and
      every six months to reflect any changes in the energy node prices, which is
      a
      pass-through to regulated customers of the energy charge that Elfec pays to
      generation companies. The tariffs are calculated every four years. The most
      recent tariff review was completed in January 2004 and new prices became
      effective at that time.

EMPLOYEE
      RELATIONS

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL and its subsidiaries had the following full-time
      employees.

(a)

Includes
                union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, which tend
                to
                fluctuate due to the nature of their business.

(b)

Includes
                employees of WPD and PPL Global's consolidated subsidiaries in Latin
                America.

Approximately
      60%, or 5,076, of PPL's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with
      four IBEW locals representing 3,579 employees. The other unions primarily
      represent employees of the mechanical contractors and gas utility employees
      in
      Pennsylvania. The bargaining agreement with the largest union was negotiated
      in
      May 2002 and expires in May 2006. Eight four-year contracts with smaller gas
      utility locals in Pennsylvania were negotiated in 2003. In June 2004, the IBEW
      representing approximately 240 employees at the Montana Colstrip power plant
      approved a new four-year labor agreement expiring in June 2008. In April 2005,
      a
      three-year contract expiring in April 2008 was negotiated with an IBEW local
      in
      Montana that represents approximately 80 employees at the hydroelectric facility
      and at the Corette plant.

Approximately
      79%, or 2,997, of PPL's international workforce are members of labor unions.
      WPD
      employs the majority of the international workforce. WPD recognizes five unions,
      the largest of which represents 37% of union members. WPD has two employment
      agreements that are negotiated with the unions. The largest agreement, the
      Electricity Business Agreement, covers 2,037 union employees; it may be amended
      by agreement between WPD and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice
      by either side.

PPL's
      Latin American subsidiaries have 879 union employees that are represented by
      unions. Emel and DelSur have agreements in place until 2006. Annually, Elfec
      negotiates adjustments to its compensation and benefits.

ITEM
      1A. RISK FACTORS

PPL,
      PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with their
      businesses. While we have tried to identify below the risks we currently
      consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we face. Additional
      risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
      impair our business operations. Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows
      or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these
      risks. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other
      statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. See
      "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
      Note 14 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the risks
      described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact
      our businesses and financial results.

As
      used
      in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and
      its
      consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its
      consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International
      Delivery segment discussions, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries
      taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Delivery segment
      discussion.

Risks
      Related to Supply Segment

(

PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply

)

Adverse
      changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy
      margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash
      flows.

Our
      energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power
      exceed our costs of supplying power, are impacted by changes in the market
      prices for electricity, as well as fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel
      transportation costs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges
      and other costs. Unlike most other commodities, electric power cannot be stored
      and must be produced at the time of use. As a result, the wholesale market
      prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods
      of time and can be unpredictable. Among the factors that can influence such
      prices are:

See
      Exhibit 99(b) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in
      wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five
      years.

Whether
      we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power
      sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements in order to mitigate
      market price and supply risk may affect our earnings.

A
      substantial portion of our anticipated generation production currently is
      committed under long-term power sales agreements that include fixed prices
      for
      our electric power. We also enter into long-term fuel purchase and fuel
      transportation agreements that include fixed prices. Whether we decide to,
      or
      are able to, continue to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements
      and the market conditions at that time will affect our financial performance.
      For instance, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would
      sell
      the energy, capacity and other products from our facilities into the competitive
      wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current
      market prices. Although the current forward prices for electricity significantly
      exceed the prices available under our current long-term power sales agreements,
      this situation may not continue. In addition, if we do not secure or maintain
      favorable long-term fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our
      power generation facilities, our fuel costs (and the associated fuel
      transportation costs) could exceed the revenues that we derive from our energy
      sales. Given the volatility and potential for material differences between
      actual electricity prices and fuel and other costs, if we do not secure or
      maintain long-term electricity sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation
      agreements, our margins will be subject to increased volatility and, depending
      on future electricity and fuel costs (and the associated fuel transportation
      costs), our financial results may be materially adversely affected.

Disruptions
      in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability
      to
      operate our generation facilities.

We
      purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel,
      including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties,
      labor
      relations or environmental regulations affecting our fuel suppliers, could
      adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result
      in
      lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of
      operations.

Our
      generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our
      expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our
      financial performance.

Our
      ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is
      critical to our financial performance. Operation of our power plants at expected
      capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of
      equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel interruption. In
      addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt our generation plants.
      Weather conditions also have a direct impact on the river flows required to
      operate our hydroelectric plants at expected capacity levels. Depending on
      the
      timing and duration of both planned and unplanned complete or partial outages
      at
      our power plants (in particular, if such outages are during peak periods or
      during periods of, or caused by, severe weather), our revenues from energy
      sales
      could be significantly decreased and our expenses significantly increased,
      and
      we could be required to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy
      our energy sales commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages
      for our failure to satisfy them. While we have been successful in the past
      several years in increasing fleet-wide equivalent availability (i.e., the
      percentage of time in a year that a generating unit is capable of producing
      power) from the low 80% range to over 90%, many of our generating units are
      reaching mid-life, and we are faced with the potential for outages of longer
      duration to accommodate significant investments in major component
      replacements.

Changes
      in technology may impair the value of our power
      plants.

A
      basic
      premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants
      achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price.
      There are other technologies for producing electricity, most notably fuel cells,
      microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. Research and
      development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in the alternate
      technologies. It is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate
      methods of electric production to a level that is equal to or below that of
      most
      central station electric production. If this were to happen, the value of our
      generation facilities may be significantly impaired.

We
      rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control
      to
      deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas. If transmission is disrupted,
      or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell
      and deliver power may be hindered.

We
      depend
      on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities
      and
      other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to
      the
      wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric
      generation facilities. If transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather,
      natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by ISOs, in
      applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and
      deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or
      we
      may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms.

The
      FERC
      has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services
      to
      be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. Although these
      regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
      transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access
      to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission
      capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we desire. We cannot
      predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or
      the
      adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs in
      applicable markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related
      services, efficiently.

The
      PLR contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply, and demand
      significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy
      margins.

PPL
      Electric has agreed to provide electricity supply to its PLR customers at
      predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into PUC-approved,
      full
      requirements energy supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at the rates PPL
      Electric is entitled to charge its PLR customers in order to fulfill its PLR
      obligation. If PPL Electric's customers obtain electricity from alternate
      suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, PPL EnergyPlus' sales
      of
      electricity under the PLR contracts may decrease.

Alternatively,
      demand that we satisfy pursuant to the PLR contracts could increase as a result
      of severe weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over which
      we have no control. We satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a
      portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets,
      contractual relationships and market purchases. At December 31, 2005, the PLR
      requirements required over 70% of the normal operating capacity of our existing
      Pennsylvania generation assets. A significant increase in demand would adversely
      affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the PLR
      contracts to provide the energy supply to fulfill this increased demand at
      the
      capped rates, which we expect to remain significantly below the wholesale prices
      at which we would have to purchase the additional supply if needed or, if we
      had
      available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional
      supply. Accordingly, any significant increase in demand could have a material
      adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

PPL
      Electric's PLR obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant
      to
      rules that have not yet been promulgated. While regulations governing PLR
      obligations after 2009 have been proposed for comment by the PUC, at this time,
      we cannot predict the content of the final regulations, including whether they
      will include requirements regarding the length, pricing or other terms of PLR
      contracts, or when the regulations will be finalized. We also cannot predict
      the
      extent to which PPL EnergyPlus will sell power to PPL Electric after
      2009.

We
      face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
      affect our ability to operate profitably.

Unlike
      our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured
      of
      any rate of return on our capital investments through predetermined rates,
      and
      our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our ability to operate
      in a competitive environment. We expect the deregulated electricity markets
      to
      continue to be competitive. Competition is impacted by electricity and fuel
      prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets,
      technological advances in power generation, the actions of regulatory
      authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact
      our ability to sell energy and related products and the prices which we may
      charge for such products, which could adversely affect our results of operations
      and our ability to grow our business.

Following
      the expiration of our existing long-term power sales agreements, we currently
      expect to sell a significant portion of our available capacity into the
      competitive wholesale markets through contracts of shorter duration. Competition
      in the wholesale power markets will occur principally on the basis of the price
      of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and
      availability. We expect the commencement of commercial operation of new electric
      facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity
      will continue to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity
      market in those regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the
      prices we receive for electricity.

We
      also
      face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary
      services. We primarily compete with other electricity merchants based on our
      ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources
      and
      to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and
      transmission from electric utilities and ISOs. We also compete against other
      energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to
      credit sources, and many of our competitors have greater financial resources
      than we have.

Competitors
      in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL
      EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies,
      non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities.
      In
      the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other
      investments in the electric utility sector. Entirely new competitors, including
      financial institutions, may enter the energy markets as a result of the recent
      repeal of PUHCA. The repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our
      industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial
      resources than we have.

If
      the present trend towards competitive markets is reversed, discontinued or
      delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially
      adversely affected.

Some
      deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price
      volatility. In some of these markets, government agencies and other interested
      parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring or even re-regulate
      areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated. For example,
      in
      2001, the FERC instituted a series of price controls designed to mitigate (or
      cap) prices in the entire western U.S. to address the extreme volatility in
      the
      California electricity markets. These price controls have had the effect of
      significantly lowering spot and forward electricity prices in the western
      market. In addition, the independent system operators, or ISOs, that oversee
      the
      transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time
      to
      time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address
      volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other
      mechanisms may reduce the profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading
      business would have realized based on competitive market conditions absent
      such
      limitations and mechanisms. Although we expect the deregulated electricity
      markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our
      industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric
      power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued
      or
      reversed in the states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate.

We
      are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling
      and
      marketing products in the wholesale electricity
      markets.

We
      purchase and sell electricity at the wholesale level under market-based tariffs
      authorized by the FERC throughout the United States and also enter into
      short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our
      generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price
      fluctuations. If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under
      these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. These damages would
      generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
      replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of the undelivered
      capacity or electricity. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale
      electricity markets, such damages could be significant. Extreme weather
      conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, transmissions disruptions,
      and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause
      significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and
      electricity.

In
      addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to
      post
      collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy
      varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds. At December 31, 2005,
      we
      posted $540 million of collateral, in the form of letters of credit, under
      these
      contracts. Although we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity
      facilities to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these
      contracts, we have increased over the past two years our available liquidity
      facilities (from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004 to $2.4 billion at December
      31, 2005) to satisfy these collateral obligations and to maintain our credit
      ratings due, in significant part, to the potential collateral requirements
      under
      these contracts.

We
      also
      face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their
      performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a
      lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher priced market than existed
      at
      the time of contract. We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means,
      including through agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral
      for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices
      beyond certain thresholds. However, there can be no assurance that we will
      avoid
      counterparty non-performance. Counterparty non-performance could adversely
      impact our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which could
      in turn subject us to claims for damages.

We
      do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price
      volatility.

We
      attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity
      sales arrangements by reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity
      to
      satisfy our net firm sales contracts. We also routinely enter into contracts,
      such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our
      exposure to weather conditions, fuel requirements and other electricity-related
      commodities. However, based on economic and other considerations, we may not
      hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility.
      To
      the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results
      of
      operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

Our
      risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices,
      interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned,
      and we may suffer economic losses despite such
      programs.

We
      actively manage the market risk inherent in our electricity and fuel, debt,
      foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. We have implemented
      procedures to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management policy
      and
      programs, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification
      of
      risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting
      of various risk measurement metrics. Nonetheless, adverse changes in electricity
      and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
      counterparty credit exposures may result in losses in our earnings or cash
      flows
      and adversely affect our balance sheet.

Our
      risk
      management programs may not work as planned. For instance, actual electricity
      and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the
      historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management
      positions. Similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could
      change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not set
      up
      to address. As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk
      management decisions may have on us if actual events lead to greater losses
      or
      costs than our risk management positions were intended to hedge. If our risk
      management positions are ineffective in this way, we could be subject to
      mark-to-market accounting with respect to certain of our risk management
      contracts, which could lead to significant volatility in our earnings and our
      balance sheet.

In
      addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed
      to
      the credit risk that counterparties that owe us money, electricity or fuel
      will
      breach their obligations. We have established a risk management policy and
      programs, including credit risk programs, to evaluate counterparty credit risk.
      However, if counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be
      forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.
      In
      that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely
      affected.

Despite
      federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject
      to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues,
      or
      prevent or delay operation of our facilities.

Our
      U.S.
      generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. Generally,
      our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to
      regulation by the FERC. The FERC has authorized us to sell generation from
      our
      facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.
      The
      FERC retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority
      and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not
      workably competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging
      just and reasonable rates. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings - FERC Market-Based
      Rate Authority," for the status of FERC's review of our Western market-based
      rate filing for PPL Montana. Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may
      receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could
      materially adversely affect our results of operations.

In
      addition, the acquisition, ownership and operation of electricity generation
      facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from
      federal, state and local governmental agencies. We may not be able to obtain
      or
      maintain all required regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining
      any
      required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required
      approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation
      of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or
      become subject to additional costs.

Our
      costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to
      continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital
      expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely
      affect our profitability and liquidity.

Our
      business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and
      regulations relating to environmental protection. To comply with existing and
      future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control
      measures we may take, we expect to spend substantial amounts in the future
      on
      environmental control and compliance. For example, as a result of existing
      and
      recently-enacted federal environmental laws and regulations governing air
      emissions from coal-burning plants (in particular, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
      oxide and mercury emissions), as of December 31, 2005, we planned to spend
      about
      $1.5 billion from 2005 through 2010 to install pollution control equipment
      at
      certain of our coal plants.

With
      respect to sulfur dioxide emission reduction, based on expected levels of
      generation, emission allowance shortfalls that would otherwise occur without
      significant purchases of allowances and projected emission allowance prices,
      we
      have determined that it is more economic to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers
      at
      certain of our plants rather than purchase necessary allowances in order to
      meet
      environmental requirements. Specifically, we plan to install scrubbers at our
      Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner Island Unit 3 by 2008 and at our Brunner
      Island Units 1 and 2 during 2009. Following the installation of the scrubbers,
      we expect to have excess emission allowances that we could sell at then-current
      market prices. Any significant delay in our installation of these scrubbers
      would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity, since we would be
      required to purchase rather than sell emission allowances.

There
      also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide
      and
      other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global warming).
      Further, many states and environmental groups have also challenged certain
      of
      the federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being
      sufficiently strict. As a result, it is possible that state and federal
      regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations on
      emissions than are currently in effect.

We
      may
      not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals
      necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary
      to
      our business. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental
      regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such
      approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or subjected
      to
      additional costs. Further, at some of our older facilities it may be
      uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment, which may cause us
      to
      shut down those generation units.

We
      are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our
      Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety
      requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and
      uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its
      licensed life.

Nuclear
      generation accounted for about 30% of our 2005 generation output. The risks
      of
      nuclear generation generally include:

·

the
                potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting
                from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling
                and
                disposal of radioactive materials;

·

limitations
                on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
                losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear
                operations; and

·

uncertainties
                with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
                nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
                lives.

The
      NRC
      has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as
      well
      as security-related and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
      generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority
      to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment
      of
      the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In addition,
      revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate
      substantial capital or operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.
      In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident
      at our Susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational
      loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results
      of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

A
      continued increase in the price of crude oil could result in a phase-out of
      the
      significant tax credits that we receive based on our production and sale of
      synthetic fuel and a reduction in the availability of synthetic fuel that we
      purchase from unaffiliated third parties, which could adversely affect our
      results of operations and cash flows.

We
      have
      interests in two synthetic fuel facilities and receive tax credits pursuant
      to
      Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code based on our sale of synthetic fuel
      to
      unaffiliated third-party purchasers. We also purchase synthetic fuel from
      unaffiliated third parties, at prices below the market price of coal, for use
      at
      our coal-fired power plants. The availability of the Section 29 tax credits
      is
      scheduled to expire after 2007. In addition, Section 29 provides for the
      phase-out of the tax credit when the average reference price for crude oil,
      as
      adjusted for inflation, falls within a certain range, and the tax credits are
      completely eliminated if the reference price exceeds the phase-out range. We
      do
      not expect any phase-out for 2005, but we cannot predict whether these credits
      will be phased out for 2006 or 2007, or the inflation for these years that
      affects the determination of the phase-out range of the tax credit. We have
      entered into economic hedge transactions that will serve to mitigate some of
      the
      earnings and cash flow impact that increases in crude oil prices for 2006 and
      2007 within the phase-out range would have on our synthetic fuel operations.
      However, if the price of crude oil remains at or increases above current levels,
      we expect to experience a significant reduction in our synthetic fuel tax
      credits, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows
      for those years. Based on forecast oil prices and other market factors for
      and 2007, we will evaluate our synthetic fuel production levels and operations.
      Furthermore, the suppliers of synthetic fuel to our coal-fired plants could
      decide to cease or reduce their synthetic fuel operations as a result of the
      impact of higher crude oil prices on their tax credits, requiring us to seek
      alternative synthetic fuel supply or to meet our supply needs with coal, which
      would significantly increase our fuel costs.

Risks
      Related to International Delivery Segment

(

PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply

)

Our
      international delivery businesses also are subject to risks with respect to
      rate-regulation and operational performance.

Like
      our
      Pennsylvania delivery businesses, our international delivery businesses are
      rate-regulated. In addition, their ability to manage operational risk is
      critical to their financial performance. Accordingly, these businesses are
      subject to the same risks as those described below "Risks Related to
      Pennsylvania Delivery Segment."

Our
      international delivery businesses expose us to risks related to laws of other
      countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
      rates, political and social conditions and policies of foreign governments.
      These risks may reduce our results of operations from our delivery
      businesses.

The
      acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects outside of the
      United States entail significant financial risks, which vary by country,
      including:

Our
      international operations are subject to regulation by various foreign
      governments and regulatory authorities. The laws and regulations of some
      countries may limit our ability to hold a majority interest in some of the
      projects that we may develop or acquire, thus limiting our ability to control
      the development, construction and operation of those projects. In addition,
      the
      legal environment in foreign countries in which we currently own assets or
      projects or may develop projects in the future could make it more difficult
      for
      us to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects. Our
      international projects also may be subject to risks of being delayed, suspended
      or terminated by the applicable foreign governments or may be subject to risks
      of contract invalidation by commercial or governmental entities.

Despite
      contractual or other protections we have against many of these risks for our
      international operations or potential investments in the future, our actual
      results and the value of our investments may be adversely affected by the
      occurrence of any of these events.

Risks
      Related to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment

(

PPL
      and PPL Electric

)

Regulators
      may not approve the rates we request.

Our
      Pennsylvania delivery businesses are rate-regulated. While such regulation
      is
      generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable
      rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery
      customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities,
      and there is no guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match
      our
      actual costs or provide a particular return on invested capital at any given
      time.

Our
      transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which
      may
      increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect
      on our financial performance.

Our
      ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and
      distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery
      business. Our delivery business also faces several risks, including the
      breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due
      to
      severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes. Operation
      of
      our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenues or
      increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs.

PPL
      Electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able to
      obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge
      to
      its PLR customers.

In
      order
      to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply,
      through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates we may charge to our PLR
      customers, we have entered into PUC-approved, full requirements energy supply
      agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at these capped rates. Under one of the PLR
      contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits with PPL
      EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract price
      by more than our contract collateral threshold. Conversely, PPL EnergyPlus
      is
      required to make performance assurance deposits with us when the market price
      of
      electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its contract
      collateral threshold. Over the past few years, market prices for electricity
      have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at December 31, 2005,
      the market price of electricity exceeded the contract price by approximately
      $4.2 billion. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005, PPL EnergyPlus was
      required to provide us with performance assurance of $300 million, the maximum
      amount of collateral required under the contract. If PPL EnergyPlus is unable
      to
      satisfy its energy supply obligations to us under the PLR contracts, we would
      be
      required to obtain energy supply in the wholesale market at then-current market
      rates to meet our PLR obligation. While the Customer Choice Act provides
      generally for PLR costs to be borne by customers, it is not clear whether we
      would be able to pass on to our customers any costs of this replacement energy
      supply that exceed the predetermined capped rates.

Our
      PLR
      obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant to rules that
      have
      not yet been promulgated. While regulations governing PLR obligations after
      have been proposed for comment by the PUC, at this time, we cannot predict
      the
      content of the final regulations, including the specific mechanism for recovery
      from customers of our costs for energy supply, or when the regulations will
      be
      finalized.

Other
      Risks Related to All Segments

(

PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric

)

Our
      operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result
      of
      severe weather conditions.

Our
      businesses may be seasonal. For example, in some markets demand for, and market
      prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other markets
      such peaks occur in the cold winter months. As a result, our overall operating
      results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis,
      especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold
      weather or storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this
      fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities
      we
      acquire or develop and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity.

We
      cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently
      being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. An
      adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial
      condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We
      are
      involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to
      ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations,
      the most significant of which are summarized in "Item 3. Legal Proceedings"
      and
      in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements.
      We
      cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably
      estimate the costs or liability that could potentially result from a negative
      outcome in each case.

We
      may need significant additional financing to pursue growth
      opportunities.

We
      continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may
      enter
      into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the
      future. An acquisition agreement or development commitment may require access
      to
      substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable terms. We also may need
      external financing to fund capital expenditures, including capital expenditures
      necessary to comply with environmental regulations or other regulatory
      requirements. Our ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are
      dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, credit
      availability and our financial performance. The inability to obtain sufficient
      financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability
      to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital
      expenditures.

A
      downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access
      capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any
      new
      debt.

Our
      current credit ratings by Moody's, Fitch and S&P are listed in

"Item
      7.
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

While we
      do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund our short-term
      liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any ratings downgrades
      could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability
      to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term
      debt.

Significant
      increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including our health care
      and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and
      liquidity.

We
      continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and
      maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost
      pressures, especially with respect to health care and pension costs. Pursuant
      to
      our collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide
      specified levels of health care and pension benefits to current employees and
      retirees covered by the contracts, and we provide a similar level of benefits
      to
      our management employees, which benefits give rise to significant expenses.
      We
      have experienced significant health care cost inflation in the last few years,
      and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage,
      to
      continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to continue
      to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs
      of their health care benefits. In addition, we expect to continue to experience
      significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans that we
      sponsor for our employees and retirees. For example, we expect WPD to experience
      increased pension costs due to a March 2004 actuarial valuation of WPD's plans
      that reflects higher pension obligations. The increase in WPD's pension costs
      in
      2005 was $26 million after tax, and the increase in WPD's pension costs is
      expected to continue to be significant in 2006. The measurement of our expected
      future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly
      dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond
      our control. These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates,
      health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the
      demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate,
      our costs could be significantly increased.

There
      is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future
      for
      certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our
      earnings.

Under
      GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual
      basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets
      may be impaired. While no goodwill impairments were required based on our annual
      review in the fourth quarter of 2005, we are unable to predict whether any
      impairment charges may be necessary in the future.

We
      also
      review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances
      indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We
      did
      not record any significant impairment charges on these assets during 2005,
      but
      we did record a loss on the sale of our Sundance generation station (as
      described in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.) We are unable to predict
      whether impairment charges may be necessary in the future. In particular, our
      ability to recover our investment in our gas-fired generation facilities, and
      to
      avoid any future impairment charges with respect to these assets, will depend
      upon future electricity and fuel price levels (which are subject to substantial
      fluctuations), as well as applicable accounting rules and other
      factors.

Montana
      Power Shareholders' Litigation

In
      August
      2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders
      of
      Montana Power against Montana Power, the directors of Montana Power, certain
      advisors and consultants of Montana Power and PPL Montana. The plaintiffs
      allege, among other things, that Montana Power was required to, and did not,
      obtain shareholder approval of the sale of Montana Power's generation assets
      to
      PPL Montana in 1999. Although most of the claims in the complaint are against
      Montana Power, its board of directors, and its consultants and advisors, two
      claims are asserted against PPL Montana. In the first claim, plaintiffs seek
      a
      declaration that because Montana Power shareholders did not vote on the 1999
      sale of generating assets to PPL Montana, that sale "was null and void ab
      initio." The second claim alleges that PPL Montana was privy to and participated
      in a strategy whereby Montana Power would sell its generation assets to PPL
      Montana without first obtaining Montana Power shareholder approval, and that
      PPL
      Montana has made net profits in excess of $100 million as the result of this
      alleged illegal sale. In the second claim, plaintiffs request that the court
      impose a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets
      themselves and all profits, plus interest on the amounts subject to the trust.
      This lawsuit has been pending in the U.S. District Court of Montana, Butte
      Division and the judge has placed this proceeding on hold pending the outcome
      of
      certain motions currently before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
      of
      Delaware, the resolution of which may impact this proceeding. PPL and PPL Energy
      Supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

NorthWestern
      Corporation Litigation

In
      September 2002, NorthWestern filed a lawsuit against PPL Montana in Montana
      state court seeking specific performance of a provision in the Montana Power
      APA
      concerning the proposed purchase by PPL Montana of a portion of NorthWestern's
      interest in the 500-kilovolt Colstrip Transmission System (CTS) for $97 million.

In
      2005,
      PPL Montana and NorthWestern settled the litigation, and PPL Energy Supply
      recorded a charge of $9 million ($6 million after tax, or $0.02 per share for
      PPL) in the first quarter of 2005 related to the settlement agreement. Pursuant
      to the settlement agreement, all claims of the parties in the litigation were
      dismissed with prejudice, NorthWestern retained its interest in the CTS, and
      PPL
      Montana paid NorthWestern $9 million in October 2005.

Montana
      Hydroelectric Litigation

In
      October 2003, a lawsuit was filed against PPL Montana, PPL Services, Avista
      Corporation, PacifiCorp and nine John Doe defendants in the U.S. District Court
      of Montana, Missoula Division, by two residents allegedly acting in a
      representative capacity on behalf of the State of Montana. In January 2004,
      the
      complaint was amended to, among other things, include the Great Falls school
      districts as additional plaintiffs. In May 2004, the Montana Attorney General
      filed a motion to allow the State of Montana to intervene as an additional
      plaintiff in the litigation. This motion was granted without objection. The
      individual plaintiffs, the school districts and the State sought declaratory
      judgment, compensatory damages and attorneys fees and costs for use of state
      and/or "school trust" lands by hydropower facilities and to require the
      defendants to adequately compensate the State and/or the State School Trust
      fund
      for full market value of lands occupied. Generally, the suit is founded on
      allegations that the bed of navigable rivers became state-owned property upon
      Montana's admission to statehood, and that the use thereof for placement of
      dam
      structures, affiliated structures and reservoirs should, under an existing
      regulatory scheme, trigger lease payments for use of land underneath. The
      plaintiffs also sought relief on theories of unjust enrichment, trespass and
      negligence. No specific amount of damages or future rental value has been
      claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss
      the
      individual plaintiffs' and school districts' complaint, as well as the complaint
      of the State of Montana. In September 2004, the federal court granted the
      motions to dismiss the individual plaintiffs' and school districts' complaint
      but denied the similar motions as to the State of Montana's complaint. Following
      the federal court's September decision, PPL Montana and the other defendants
      filed a motion to dismiss the State of Montana's complaint for lack of diversity
      jurisdiction and also filed a motion to vacate certain portions of the decision.
      The federal court granted both of these motions in September 2005.

In
      November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation and PacifiCorp commenced an
      action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court seeking
      a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for the hydropower
      facilities' use and occupancy of streambeds can be collected by the State of
      Montana. The State subsequently filed counterclaims and a motion for summary
      judgment. In February 2005, the individual plaintiffs and school districts
      who
      were dismissed from the federal court proceeding, along with a state teachers'
      union, filed a motion to intervene as additional defendants in this state court
      proceeding, and also filed a proposed answer and counterclaims to be used if
      their motion to intervene is granted. The state court denied this motion to
      intervene, but has not yet ruled on any of the other above-described motions.
      PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of the state court
      proceeding.

California
      ISO and Western Markets

Through
      its subsidiaries, PPL made approximately $18 million of sales to the California
      ISO during the period from October 2000 through June 2001, of which $17 million
      has not been paid to PPL subsidiaries. Given the myriad of electricity supply
      problems presently faced by the California electric utilities and the California
      ISO, PPL cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. At December
      31,
      2005, PPL has fully reserved for possible underrecoveries of payments for these
      sales.

Regulatory
      proceedings arising out of the California electricity supply situation have
      been
      filed at the FERC. The FERC has determined that all sellers of energy into
      markets operated by the California ISO and the California Power Exchange,
      including PPL Montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period
      beginning October 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001, and initiated an evidentiary
      hearing concerning refund amounts. In April 2003, the FERC changed the manner
      in
      which this refund liability is to be computed and ordered further proceedings
      to
      determine the exact amounts that the sellers, including PPL Montana, would
      be
      required to refund. In September 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
      Circuit held that the FERC had the additional legal authority to order refunds
      for periods prior to October 2, 2000, and ordered the FERC to determine whether
      or not it would be appropriate to grant such additional refunds.

In
      June
      2003, the FERC took several actions as a result of a number of related
      investigations. The FERC terminated proceedings pursuant to which it had been
      considering whether to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in
      the
      Pacific Northwest, including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period
      December 2000 through June 2001. The FERC also commenced additional
      investigations relating to "gaming" and bidding practices during 2000 and 2001,
      but, to their knowledge, neither PPL EnergyPlus nor PPL Montana is a subject
      of
      these investigations.

Litigation
      arising out of the California electricity supply situation has been filed in
      California courts against sellers of energy to the California ISO. The
      plaintiffs and intervenors in these legal proceedings allege, among other
      things, abuse of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade
      practices and violations of state antitrust laws, and seek other relief,
      including treble damages and attorneys' fees. While PPL's subsidiaries have
      not
      been named by the plaintiffs in these legal proceedings, PPL Montana was named
      by a defendant in its cross-complaint in a consolidated court proceeding, which
      combined into one master proceeding several of the lawsuits alleging antitrust
      violations and unfair trade practices. This generator denies that any unlawful,
      unfair or fraudulent conduct occurred but asserts that, if it is found liable,
      the other generators and power marketers, including PPL Montana, caused,
      contributed to and/or participated in the plaintiffs' alleged
      losses.

In
      February 2004, the Montana Public Service Commission initiated a limited
      investigation of the Montana retail electricity market for the years 2000 and
      2001, focusing on how that market was affected by transactions involving the
      possible manipulation of the electricity grid in the western U.S. The
      investigation includes all public utilities and licensed electricity suppliers
      in Montana, as well as other entities that may possess relevant information.
      Through its subsidiaries, PPL is a licensed electricity supplier in Montana
      and
      a wholesale supplier in the western U.S. In June 2004, the Montana Attorney
      General served PPL Montana and more than 20 other companies with subpoenas
      requesting documents, and PPL Montana has provided responsive documents to
      the
      Montana Attorney General. As with the other investigations taking place as
      a
      result of the issues arising out of the electricity supply situation in
      California and other western states, PPL and its subsidiaries believe that
      they
      have not engaged in any improper trading or marketing practices affecting the
      Montana retail electricity market.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries believe that they have not engaged in any improper trading
      practices. However, they cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, any
      PPL
      subsidiaries will be the target of any additional governmental investigations
      or
      named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings. PPL also cannot predict the
      outcome of any such lawsuits or proceedings or whether the ultimate impact
      on
      them of the electricity supply situation in California and other western states
      will be material.

PJM
      Capacity Litigation

In
      December 2002, PPL was served with a complaint against PPL, PPL EnergyPlus
      and
      PPL Electric filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
      Pennsylvania by a group of 14 Pennsylvania boroughs that apparently alleges,
      among other things, violations of the federal antitrust laws in connection
      with
      the pricing of installed capacity in the PJM daily market during the first
      quarter of 2001. These boroughs were wholesale customers of PPL Electric. In
      addition, in November 2003, PPL and PPL EnergyPlus were served with a complaint
      which was filed in the same court by Joseph Martorano, III (d/b/a ENERCO),
      that
      also alleges violations of the federal antitrust laws in early 2001. The
      complaint indicates that ENERCO provides consulting and energy procurement
      services to clients in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In September 2004, this
      complaint was dismissed by the District Court, and in June 2005 the U.S. Court
      of Appeals for the Third Circuit denied the plaintiff's appeal.

Each
      of
      the U.S. Department of Justice - Antitrust Division, the FERC and the
      Pennsylvania Attorney General conducted investigations regarding PPL's PJM
      capacity market transactions in early 2001 and did not find any reason to take
      action against PPL.

New
      England Investigation

In
      January 2004, PPL became aware of an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney
      General and the FERC's Office of Market Oversight and Investigation (OMOI)
      regarding allegations that natural gas-fired generators located in New England
      illegally sold natural gas instead of generating electricity during the week
      of
      January 12, 2004. Subsequently, PPL and other generators were served with a
      data
      request by OMOI. The data request indicated that PPL was not under suspicion
      of
      a regulatory violation, but that OMOI was conducting an initial investigation.
      PPL has responded to this data request. PPL also has responded to data requests
      of ISO New England and data requests served by subpoena from the Connecticut
      Attorney General. Both OMOI and ISO New England have issued preliminary reports
      finding no regulatory or other violations concerning these matters. While PPL
      does not believe that it committed any regulatory or other violations concerning
      the subject matter of these investigations, PPL cannot predict the outcome
      of
      these investigations.

PJM
      Billing

In
      December 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy,
      Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC
      alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as
      a
      result of an error by PJM in the State Estimator Model used in connection with
      billing all PJM customers for certain transmission, spot market energy and
      ancillary services charges. Specifically, the complaint alleges that PJM
      mistakenly identified PPL Electric's Elroy substation transformer as belonging
      to PECO and that, as a consequence, during times of congestion, PECO's bills
      for
      transmission congestion from PJM erroneously reflected energy that PPL Electric
      took from the Elroy substation and used to serve PPL Electric's load. The
      complaint requests the FERC, among other things, to direct PPL Electric to
      refund to PJM $39 million, plus interest of approximately $8 million, and for
      PJM to refund these same amounts to PECO. In February 2005, PPL Electric filed
      its response with the FERC stating that neither PPL Electric nor any of its
      affiliates should be held financially responsible or liable to PJM or PECO
      as a
      result of PJM's error.

In
      April
      2005, the FERC issued an Order Establishing Hearing and Settlement Judge
      Proceedings (the Order). In the Order, the FERC determined that PECO is entitled
      to reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges that PECO asserts
      PJM
      erroneously billed to it at the Elroy substation. The FERC set for additional
      proceedings before a judge the determination of the amount of the overcharge
      to
      PECO and which PJM market participants were undercharged and therefore are
      responsible for reimbursement to PECO. The FERC also ordered procedures before
      a
      judge to attempt to reach a settlement of the dispute.

PPL
      Electric recognized an after-tax charge of approximately $27 million (or $0.07
      per share for PPL) in the first quarter of 2005 for a loss contingency related
      to this matter. The pre-tax accrual was approximately $47 million, with $39
      million included in "Energy purchases" on the Statement of Income, and $8
      million in "Interest Expense."

In
      September 2005, PPL Electric and Exelon Corporation filed a proposed settlement
      agreement regarding this matter with the FERC. Under the settlement agreement,
      PPL Electric would pay $33 million plus interest over a four-year period to
      PJM
      through a new transmission charge that, under applicable law, is recoverable
      from PPL Electric's retail customers. Also, all PJM market participants would
      pay approximately $8 million plus interest over a four-year period to PJM
      through a new market adjustment charge. PJM would forward amounts collected
      under the two new charges to PECO. PJM filed comments with the FERC neither
      supporting nor opposing the settlement agreement, and the FERC Trial Staff
      filed
      comments with the FERC supporting the settlement agreement. Numerous other
      parties, including PJM market participants, filed comments with the FERC
      opposing the settlement agreement. The FERC has not yet acted on the proposed
      settlement agreement.

PPL,
      PPL
      Electric and PPL Energy Supply cannot be certain of the outcome of this matter
      or the impact on PPL and its subsidiaries. Some or all of the first quarter
      charges for this matter may be reversed in a future period depending on the
      outcome of this matter, the potential for recovery of any amounts paid as a
      result of the additional FERC proceedings, the application of the relevant
      provisions of the energy supply agreements between PPL Electric and PPL
      EnergyPlus and other factors. Depending on these factors, PPL Energy Supply,
      the
      parent company of PPL EnergyPlus, may incur some or all of the costs associated
      with this matter in a future period.

FERC
      Market-Based Rate Authority

In
      December 1998, the FERC issued an order authorizing PPL EnergyPlus to make
      wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates.
      In
      that order, the FERC directed PPL EnergyPlus to file an updated market analysis
      within three years of the date of the order, and every three years thereafter.
      PPL EnergyPlus filed its initial updated market analysis in December 2001.
      Several parties thereafter filed interventions and protests requesting that
      PPL
      EnergyPlus be required to provide additional information demonstrating that
      it
      has met the FERC's market power tests necessary for PPL EnergyPlus to continue
      its market-based rate authority. PPL EnergyPlus has responded that the FERC
      does
      not require the economic test suggested by the intervenors and that, in any
      event, it would meet such economic test if required by the FERC.

In
      June
      2004, FERC approved certain changes to its standards for granting market-based
      rate authority. As a result of the schedule adopted by the FERC, PPL EnergyPlus,
      PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of PPL Generation's subsidiaries were
      required to file, in November 2004, updated analyses demonstrating that they
      should continue to maintain market-based rate authority under the new standards.
      PPL made two filings, a Western market-based rate filing for PPL Montana and
      an
      Eastern market-based rate filing for most of the other PPL subsidiaries in
      the
      PJM region.

In
      September 2005, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the Eastern
      market-based rate filing. The FERC expressly rejected the concerns raised by
      various consumer advocates and industrial customers regarding generation market
      power of PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's generation subsidiaries in the PJM
      region. The FERC's order required the subsidiaries to make a compliance filing
      providing further support that they cannot erect other non-transmission barriers
      to entry into the generation market, and the PPL subsidiaries made this
      compliance filing in October 2005.

Also
      in
      September 2005, in an order on PPL's western market-based rate filing, the
      FERC
      found that PPL Montana did not pass one of the FERC's initial screening tests
      for market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area, namely the wholesale
      market share screen. As a result, PPL Montana was required to make a more
      detailed filing with the FERC demonstrating that it meets the market power
      tests. Also, the FERC has established a refund effective date of November 8,
      2005 (for sales made in the Northwestern Energy Control Area pursuant to
      contracts entered into on and after that date), in the event that PPL Montana
      does not pass the FERC's market power tests. The FERC's order is not a
      definitive determination that PPL Montana has market power but rather the FERC's
      mechanism for analyzing market-based rate authority applications that require
      further scrutiny. In October 2005, PPL Montana made the more detailed filing
      with the FERC, which PPL Montana believes demonstrates that it cannot exercise
      generation market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area and should
      be
      granted market-based rate authority in that area. The FERC has not yet acted
      on
      this more detailed filing. While PPL Montana continues to believe that it does
      not have market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area, it cannot predict
      the outcome of this proceeding.

Martins
      Creek Ash Basin

In
      August
      2005, a leak from a disposal basin containing fly ash and water used in
      connection with the operation of the two 150-MW coal-fired generating units
      at
      the Martins Creek generating facility caused the discharge of approximately
      million gallons of water containing ash from the basin onto adjacent roadways
      and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware River. The leak was
      stopped, and PPL has determined that the problem was caused by a failure in
      the
      disposal basin's discharge structure. PPL is continuing to work with the
      Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies and consultants to assess the
      extent of the environmental damage caused by the ash in the discharged water
      and
      to remediate the damage. PPL shut down the two coal-fired generating units
      in
      August 2005 and placed the units back in service in December 2005 after
      completing the repairs and upgrades to the basin and obtaining the Pennsylvania
      DEP's approval.

On
      September 20, 2005, PPL Martins Creek and the Pennsylvania DEP were served
      with
      notice by the Delaware Riverside Conservancy and several citizens of their
      intention to file a citizens' suit on the basis that the leak from the disposal
      basin at Martins Creek allegedly violated various state and federal laws. The
      Pennsylvania DEP subsequently filed a complaint in Commonwealth court against
      PPL Martins Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state
      laws
      and regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief. The Delaware
      Riverside Conservancy and several citizens have filed a motion to intervene
      in
      the Pennsylvania DEP's action, which motion includes a class action complaint
      alleging that the fly ash spill caused damages to property along a 40-mile
      stretch of the Delaware River. PPL has objected to the intervention by certain
      of the intervenors and both PPL and the Pennsylvania DEP have objected to the
      purported class action suit. PPL intends to engage in settlement discussions
      to
      resolve the Pennsylvania DEP action.

At
      this
      time, PPL has no reason to believe that the Martins Creek leak has caused any
      danger to human health or any adverse biological impact on the river aquatic
      life. However, a group of natural resource trustees, along with the Delaware
      River Basin Commission, has been conducting an assessment of any natural
      resource damages that could have been caused by the Martins Creek leak. PPL
      expects the trustees and the Delaware River Basin Commission to seek to recover
      their costs as well as any damages they determine were caused by the leak.
      PPL
      cannot predict when the assessment will be completed but does not expect it
      to
      be completed before the end of 2006.

PPL
      Energy Supply recognized a $33 million charge in the third quarter of 2005
      and
      an additional $15 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 (or a total
      of
      $31 million after tax, or $0.08 per share for PPL) in connection with the
      current expected on-site and off-site costs relating to the leak. Approximately
      $41 million of the total charge, or $27 million after tax, relates to the
      off-site costs, and the balance of the total charge, $7 million, or $4 million
      after tax, relates to the on-site costs. The pre-tax accrual of $48 million
      was
      included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income. PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the final cost of assessment and
      remediation of the leak, the outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania
      DEP, the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, and the exact nature
      of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against
      PPL, PPL Energy Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin
      leak. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also cannot predict the extent of the fines
      or
      damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions or the ultimate
      financial impact on PPL or PPL Energy Supply.

Lower
      Mt. Bethel

In
      August
      2002, the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas issued a decision setting
      the
      permissible noise levels for operation of the Lower Mt. Bethel facility. PPL
      appealed the court's decision to the Commonwealth Court, and an intervenor
      in
      the lawsuit cross-appealed the court's decision. In May 2003, the Commonwealth
      Court remanded the case to the Court of Common Pleas for further findings of
      fact concerning the zoning application relating to the construction of the
      facility. In September 2003, the Court of Common Pleas ruled in PPL's favor
      while also reaffirming its decision on the noise levels, and the intervenor
      appealed this ruling to the Commonwealth Court. In April 2004, the Commonwealth
      Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, and the Supreme Court
      of Pennsylvania has denied the intervenor's Petition for Allowance of Appeal.
      Accordingly, the September 2003 ruling by the Court of Common Pleas is
      final.

The
      certificate of occupancy for the Lower Mt. Bethel facility was issued by the
      local township zoning officer in April 2004, and the facility was placed in
      service in May 2004. In May 2004, the intervenor in the legal proceedings
      regarding the facility's permissible noise levels filed an appeal with the
      township zoning board regarding the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
      The hearing on the appeal was held in December 2004, and the intervenor's appeal
      was denied. The intervenor appealed the zoning board's decision to the
      Northampton County Court of Common Pleas in February 2005, and the Court of
      Common Pleas denied this appeal in August 2005. The intervenor did not further
      appeal this matter. Accordingly, the zoning board's decision is
      final.

ITEM
      4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY
      HOLDERS

There
      were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders, through the

      CORPORATION

ITEM
      7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
      OF
      OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
      is an
      energy and utility holding company with headquarters in Allentown, PA. See
      "Item
      1. Business - Background," for descriptions of PPL's reportable segments, which
      are Supply, International Delivery and Pennsylvania Delivery. See Exhibit 99(a)
      in Item 15 for a listing of the current corporate organization. Through its
      subsidiaries, PPL is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of
      electricity in two key markets - the northeastern and western U.S. - and in
      the
      delivery of electricity in Pennsylvania, the U.K. and Latin America. PPL's
      overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth in energy supply margins
      while
      limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable,
      long-term growth in regulated delivery businesses through efficient operations
      and strong customer and regulatory relations. More specifically, PPL's strategy
      for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply
      with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with
      creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing
      exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk.
      PPL's strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate
      these businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining the highest level
      of customer service and reliability.

PPL
      faces
      several risks in its generation business. The principal risks are electricity
      wholesale price risk, fuel supply and price risk, power plant performance and
      counterparty credit risk. PPL attempts to manage these risks through various
      means. For instance, PPL operates a portfolio of generation assets that is
      diversified as to geography, fuel source, cost structure and operating
      characteristics. PPL is focused on the operating efficiency of these power
      plants and maintaining their availability. In addition, PPL has in place and
      continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel
      supply, and other means, to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes
      in the difference, or margin, between the cost to produce electricity and the
      price at which PPL sells it. Whether PPL decides to, or is able to, continue
      to
      enter into long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel purchase
      agreements or renew its existing agreements and the market conditions at that
      time will affect its future profitability. Currently, PPL's commitments for
      energy sales are substantially satisfied through its own generation assets
      -
      i.e., PPL primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of
      generating assets through integrated generation, marketing and trading
      functions. PPL has in place risk management programs that, among other things,
      are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of earnings and
      cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign
      currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operational
      performance of its generating units.

PPL's
      electricity delivery businesses are rate-regulated. Accordingly, these
      businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may
      recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates.
      The
      principal challenge that PPL faces in its electricity delivery businesses is
      to
      maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective
      manner.

PPL
      faces
      additional financial risks in conducting international operations, such as
      fluctuations in currency exchange rates. PPL attempts to manage these financial
      risks through its risk management programs.

A
      key
      challenge for PPL's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile.
      Investors, analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy
      industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position
      of
      these companies. PPL continually focuses on strengthening its balan

ce
      sheet
      and improving its liquidity position, thereby improving its credit
      profile.

See
      "Item
      1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning the material risks that PPL
      faces in its businesses.

The
      purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL's past and
      expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the
      risks and challenges mentioned above. Specifically:

The
      information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL's
      Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

Terms
      and
      abbreviations are explained in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except
      per
      share data, unless otherwise noted.

Results
      of Operations

Earnings

Net
      income and the related EPS were:

The
      changes in net income from year to year were, in part, attributable to several
      significant items that management considers unusual. Details of these unusual
      items are provided within the review of each segment's earnings.

The
      year-to-year changes in earnings components, including domestic gross energy
      margins by region and significant income statement line items, are explained
      in
      the "Statement of Income Analysis."

PPL's
      earnings beyond 2005 are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See
      "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item
      and Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks,
      uncertainties and factors that may impact PPL's future earnings.

Segment
      Results

Net
      income by segment was:

Supply
      Segment

The
      Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
      generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
      Supply.

The
      Supply segment results in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflect the reclassification
      of
      the Sundance plant operating losses from certain income statement line items
      to
      "Loss from Discontinued Operations." See Note 9 to the Financial Statements
      for
      further discussion.

Supply
      segment net income was:

The
      after-tax change in net income was due to the following factors, including
      discontinued operations.

The
      following items, that management considers unusual, had a significant impact
      on
      the Supply segment earnings.

      Outlook

Based
      on
      current forward energy prices, PPL is projecting higher energy margins for
      its
      Supply segment in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily driven by the 8.4% increase
      in the generation prices under the PLR contracts. Higher generation output,
      higher-priced wholesale energy contracts that replace expiring contracts, and
      lower purchased power costs also are expected to improve energy margins. These
      benefits are expected to be partially offset by increased fuel and fuel
      transportation expenses, higher operation and maintenance expenses and reduced
      earnings from synfuel projects.

International
      Delivery Segment

The
      International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
      businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
      electricity. Virtually all of PPL Global's international businesses are located
      in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia.

International
      Delivery segment net income was:

The
      after-tax change in net income was due to the following factors, including
      discontinued operations.

The
      following items, that management considers unusual, had a significant impact
      on
      the International Delivery segment earnings.

      Outlook

PPL
      projects that the International Delivery segment will experience increased
      operation and maintenance expenses in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due
      to
      higher pension costs at PPL's electricity distribution companies in the U.K.,
      higher U.S. income taxes and a potential unfavorable change in foreign currency
      exchange rates in 2006.

Pennsylvania
      Delivery Segment

The
      Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric and gas delivery
      operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.

Pennsylvania
      Delivery segment net income was:

The
      after-tax change in net income was due to the following factors.

The
      following items, that management considers unusual, had a significant impact
      on
      the Pennsylvania Delivery segment earnings.

·

Operation
                and maintenance expense increased in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily
                due to increased system reliability work and tree trimming costs.
                Operation and maintenance expenses increased in 2004 compared with
                2003,
                primarily due to the write-off of certain Hurricane Isabel costs
                not
                approved for recovery by the PUC, and higher pension
                costs.

      Outlook

PPL
      projects the Pennsylvania Delivery segment will have flat delivery revenues
      in
      2006 compared with 2005 due to projected modest load growth in 2006 and because
      of higher sales in 2005 as a result of unusually warm weather. This segment
      is
      expected to experience increased operation and maintenance expenses in
      2006.

Statement
      of Income Analysis --

Domestic
      Gross Energy Margins

The
      following table provides pre-tax changes in the income statement line items
      that
      comprise domestic gross energy margins.

(a)

Adjusted
                to exclude the impact of any revenues and costs not associated with
                domestic gross energy margins, in particular, revenues and energy
                costs
                related to the international operations of PPL Global, the domestic
                delivery operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities and an
                accrual
                for the loss contingency related to the PJM billing dispute in 2005
                (see
                Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information).
                Also
                adjusted to include the margins of PPL's Sundance plant, which are
                included in "Loss from Discontinued Operations," and gains or losses
                on
                sales of emission allowances, which are included in "Other operation
                and
                maintenance" expenses, on the Statement of Income. Also, 2003 includes
                a
                reduction of the reserve for Enron
                receivables.

Changes
      in Domestic Gross Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
      gross energy margins are generated through PPL's normal hedging (non-trading)
      activities, as well as trading activities. PPL manages its non-trading energy
      business on a geographic basis that is aligned with its generation assets.
      In
      the second quarter of 2005, PPL also began participating in the Midwest ISO
      (MISO), an independent transmission system operator that serves the electric
      transmission needs of much of the Midwest. PPL records its business activities
      within MISO consistent with its accounting for activities in other
      RTOs.

Eastern
      U.S

.

Eastern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due
      to
      higher fuel costs. Average coal prices increased by 12% over last year, while
      average gas and oil prices increased by 24%. Despite record high generation
      in
      2005, the increased use of higher-cost oil and gas units to cover retail
      volumes, which were up 5% over 2004, and generation output lost during coal
      and
      nuclear plant outages contributed to lower margins. Due to market price
      increases and changes in fuel mix, average fuel prices increased 22% over 2004.
      Partially offsetting the effects of higher supply costs was a 2% increase in
      retail energy prices, in accordance with the schedule established by the PUC
      Final Order.

Eastern
      U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily
      due
      to 3% higher generation, as well as higher prices and slightly higher sales
      volumes. In PJM, where the majority of PPL's Eastern wholesale activity occurs,
      average spot prices rose 15% in 2004 over 2003. PPL also benefited from
      favorable transmission congestion positions. In addition, retail energy prices
      increased by approximately 1% in 2004 in accordance with the schedule
      established by the PUC. The higher sales volumes reflect the return of customers
      who had previously shopped for electricity, as well as new load obligations
      in
      Connecticut and New Jersey, partially offset by lower wholesale sales. Partially
      offsetting these improvements were increased supply costs driven by increased
      fossil fuel and purchased power prices.

Southwestern
      U.S.

Southwestern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due
      to
      the sale of PPL's Sundance plant in May 2005 and the cost to terminate a tolling
      arrangement on the Griffith plant during the second quarter of 2005.

Southwestern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due
      to
      a 17% decrease in wholesale volumes. Also contributing to the decrease in
      margins was a $3 million positive impact to 2003 margins related to a partial
      reversal of a reserve against Enron receivables.

Net
      Energy Trading

PPL
      enters into certain energy contracts that meet the criteria of trading
      derivatives as defined by EITF Issue 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for
      Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
      Trading and Risk Management Activities." These physical and financial contracts
      cover trading activity associated with electricity, gas and oil.

Net
      energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004,
      primarily due to the inclusion of FTRs. As of July 1, 2005, FTRs were
      deemed to meet the definition of a derivative and were accounted for as such
      prospectively. Therefore, the forward and realized value for FTRs entered into
      for speculative purposes is accounted for as part of "Net energy trading
      margins" on the Statement of Income. From July 1 through December 31, 2005,
      gains on speculative FTRs totaled $10 million.

The
      $13
      million increase in net energy trading margins in 2004 compared with 2003 was
      due to a $6 million increase in electricity positions and a $6 million increase
      in gas and oil positions.

The
      physical volumes for electricity and gas associated with energy trading were
      5,800 GWh and 13.4 Bcf in 2005; 5,700 GWh and 11.7 Bcf in 2004; and 5,200 GWh
      and 12.6 Bcf in 2003. The amount of energy trading margins from unrealized
      mark-to-market transactions was a $5 million loss in 2005, a $13 million gain
      in
      2004 and not significant in 2003.

Utility
      Revenues

The
      increases in utility revenues were attributable to:

The
      increase in utility revenues for 2005 compared with 2004 was attributable
      to:

The
      increase in utility revenues for 2004 compared with 2003 was attributable
      to:

Energy-related
      Businesses

Energy-related
      businesses contributed $9 million more to operating income in 2005, compared
      with 2004. The increase was attributable to:

Energy-related
      businesses contributed $39 million less to operating income in 2004 compared
      with 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to:

Other
      Operation and Maintenance

The
      increases in other operation and maintenance expenses were due to:

The
      increase in net pension costs for both periods was primarily attributable to
      reductions in the discount rate assumption for PPL's domestic and international
      pension plans at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Increased WPD pension obligations
      as a result of the most recent actuarial valuation as of March 31, 2004, also
      served to increase the 2005 and ongoing net pension costs.

Although
      financial markets have improved and equity returns for PPL's domestic and
      international plans have been strong, interest rates on longer-duration,
      fixed-income obligations have continued to fall, requiring further reductions
      to
      the discount rates at December 31, 2005. In addition, PPL adopted the most
      current mortality tables and other demographic assumptions for its pension
      plans
      as of December 31, 2005. These assumptions are expected to increase PPL's
      pension costs for 2006 by approximately $20 million. See Note 12 to the
      financial statements for details on the funded status of PPL's pension
      plans.

Depreciation

Increases
      in depreciation expense were due to:

(a)

The
                lessor of this facility was consolidated under FIN 46, "Consolidation
                of
                Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," effective
                December 31, 2003. In June 2004, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply
                purchased the University Park generation facility from the lessor
                that was
                consolidated by PPL Energy Supply under FIN 46. See Note 22 to the
                Financial Statements for additional
                information.

Taxes,
      Other Than Income

In
      2004,
      PPL Electric reversed a $14 million accrued liability for 1998 and 1999 PURTA
      taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings
      regarding the Susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment. The rights of
      third-party intervenors to further appeal expired in 2004. The reversal and
      a
      $19 million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense, offset by an $8
      million decrease in domestic capital stock expense in 2005, are the primary
      reasons for the $30 million increase in taxes, other than income, compared
      with
      2004.

Taxes,
      other than income, decreased by $7 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The
      decrease was primarily due to the reversal of the PURTA tax liability and a
      $5
      million decrease in domestic capital stock expense, partially offset by an
      $8
      million increase in WPD's property tax, primarily from the impact of changes
      in
      foreign currency exchange rates, adjustments recorded in 2003 and an increase
      in
      property tax rates.

Workforce
      Reduction

See
      Note
      20 to the Financial Statements for information on the $9 million charge recorded
      in 2003.

Other
      Income - net

See
      Note
      16 to the Financial Statements for details of other income and
      deductions.

Financing
      Costs

The
      increase (decrease) in interest expense, which includes "Interest Expense"
      and
      "Distributions on Preferred Securities," was due to:

(a)

Prior
                to commercial operation, interest related to the Lower Mt. Bethel
                financing was capitalized as part of the cost of the
                facility.

(b)

In
                June 2004, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply purchased the University
                Park
                generation facility from the lessor that was consolidated by PPL
                Energy
                Supply under FIN 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable
                Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." In connection
                with
                the purchase, the related financing was repaid and the deferred financing
                costs were written off. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for
                further information.

Income
      Taxes

Income
      tax expense decreased by $82 million in 2005 compared with 2004. This decrease
      was primarily attributable to:

Income
      tax expense increased by $24 million in 2004 compared with 2003. This increase
      was primarily attributable to:

Annual
      tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
      may
      result from examination of prior year tax returns

by
      taxing authorities. However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of
      any
      issues raised by such authorities may differ materially from the amount accrued.
      In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL
      accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management's best estimate
      of the amount that should be recognized. An allowance is maintained for the
      tax
      contingencies, the balance of which management believes to be adequate. During
      2004, PPL reached partial settlement with the IRS with respect to the tax years
      1991 through 1995 and received a cash refund in the amount of $52 million.
      As a
      result of this settlement, the net tax impact recorded in 2004 was not
      significant.

      Note
      5 to the Financial Statements for details on effective income tax rates and
      for
      information on the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Discontinued
      Operations

In
      2003,
      PPL reported a loss of $20 million in connection with the approval of a plan
      of
      sale of PPL Global's investment in a Latin American telecommunications company.
      In 2005, PPL recorded a $47 million loss, net of a tax benefit of $26 million,
      on the sale of its Sundance power plant.

See
      Note
      9 to the Financial Statements for information on the sales, along with
      information regarding operating losses recorded in 2003, 2004 and 2005 for
      the
      Sundance plant prior to the sale and for operating losses recorded in 2004
      related to the sale of PPL Global's investment in the Latin American
      telecommunications company.

Cumulative
      Effects of Changes in Accounting Principles

In
      2003,
      PPL recorded a charge of $27 million, after-tax, as a cumulative effect of
      a
      change in accounting principle in connection with the adoption of FIN 46,
      "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.
      51,"
      for certain entities. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for additional
      information.

PPL
      adopted SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," in 2003 and
      adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
      Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," in 2005. Both pronouncements address
      the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
      long-lived assets. They require legal obligations associated with the retirement
      of long-lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial
      statements. Application of the new rules resulted in cumulative effects of
      changes in accounting principles that increased net income by $63 million in
      2003 and decreased net income by $8 million in 2005. See Note 21 to the
      Financial Statements for additional information.

Financial
      Condition

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

PPL
      is
      focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and strengthening
      its
      balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit profile. PPL believes
      that its cash on hand, short-term investments, operating cash flows, access
      to
      debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken as a whole,
      provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements, future
      security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures. PPL currently
      expects cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of 2006
      to
      be approximately $400 million, while maintaining approximately $3.3 billion
      in
      credit facilities. However, PPL's cash flows from operations and its access
      to
      cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties,
      including but not limited to:

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL had $618 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
      investments and $214 million of short-term debt, compared with $682 million
      in
      cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $42 million of short-term
      debt at December 31, 2004, and $476 million in cash, cash equivalents and
      short-term investments and $56 million of short-term debt at December 31, 2003.
      The changes in PPL's cash and cash equivalents position resulted from:

(a)

See
                Note 1 to the Financial Statements for an explanation of prior year
                reclassifications.

Operating
      Activities

Net
      cash
      from operating activities decreased by 7%, or $109 million, in 2005 compared
      with 2004, primarily as a result of increased income tax payments and fuel
      expenditures, partially offset by favorable margin impacts attributable to
      the
      7.1% increase in distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries effective
      January 1, 2005. Income tax payments increased primarily due to favorable
      impacts of tax credits and refunds realized in 2004. Fuel expenditures increased
      $115 million due to increased prices and inventory build-up in anticipation
      of
      price increases in 2006. Net cash from operating activities increased by 10%,
      or
      $142 million, in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting higher energy margins
      and
      other improvements in cash-adjusted net income.

PPL
      expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating activities
      as
      a result of its long-term and intermediate-term power sales commitments from
      wholesale and retail customers and long-term fuel purchase contracts. PPL
      estimates that, on average, approximately 84% of its expected annual generation
      output for the period 2006 through 2009 is committed under long-term and
      intermediate-term power sales contracts. PPL currently estimates that
      approximately 5% of its expected generation output for 2010 is committed under
      power sales contracts, due to the expiration of the PLR contracts at the end
      of
      2009. Consistent with its business strategy, PPL expects that the capacity
      and
      energy currently committed to long-term power sales contracts will be contracted
      in the wholesale markets during the next few years. Based on the way in which
      the wholesale markets have developed to this point, new contracts may be of
      a
      shorter duration than the PLR supply contracts with PPL Electric, which at
      inception had terms of approximately nine years.

PPL's
      contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash
      collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a
      portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a
      downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in
      market prices. For example, in addition to limiting its trading ability, if
      PPL's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment grade"
      and
      energy prices increased by 10%, PPL estimates that, based on its December 31,
      2005 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of approximately
      $611 million, compared with $280 million at December 31, 2004. PPL has in place
      risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure
      to
      volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices, interest rates,
      foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operational
      performance of its generating units.

Investing
      Activities

Although
      net cash used in investing activities remained stable in 2005 compared with
      2004, and in 2004 compared with 2003, there were significant changes in certain
      components. PPL received $190 million in proceeds from the sale of the Sundance
      power plant in 2005, compared with $123 million of proceeds from the sale of
      PPL's minority interest in CGE in 2004. For 2005 compared with 2004, there
      was
      an increase of $58 million in net proceeds from the sales of auction rate
      securities, an increase of $77 million in capital expenditures and an increase
      of $63 million in net purchases of emission allowances, in anticipation of
      future generation. For 2004 compared with 2003, PPL received $123 million of
      proceeds from the sale of PPL's minority interest in CGE in 2004, which was
      partially offset by a net increase of $60 million in restricted cash, an
      increase of $46 million in net purchases of auction rate securities and an
      increase of $46 million in net purchases of emission allowances. The primary
      use
      of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures. See "Forecasted Uses
      of
      Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2005 and projected
      expenditures for the years 2006 through 2010.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in financing activities was $676 million in 2005, compared with $578
      million in 2004 and $387 million in 2003. The increase from 2004 to 2005
      primarily reflects the continued retirement of long-term debt and increased
      dividends to shareowners. In 2005, cash used in financing activities primarily
      consisted of net debt retirements of $340 million and common and preferred
      distributions paid of $349 million, partially offset by common stock sale
      proceeds of $37 million.

In
      2004,
      cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements
      of
      $863 million and common and preferred distributions paid of $299 million,
      partially offset by common stock sale proceeds of $596 million, of which $575
      million related to the settlement of the common stock purchase contracts that
      were a component of the PEPS Units and the PEPS Units, Series B.

In
      2003,
      cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements
      of
      $460 million, preferred stock retirements of $31 million and common and
      preferred distributions paid of $287 million, partially offset by common stock
      sale proceeds of approximately $426 million. See "Forecasted Sources of Cash"
      for a discussion of PPL's plans to issue debt and equity securities, as well
      as
      a discussion of credit facility capacity available to PPL. Also see "Forecasted
      Uses of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans to pay dividends on its common
      and
      preferred securities and repurchase common stock in the future, as well as
      maturities of PPL's long-term debt.

PPL's
      debt financing activity in 2005 was:

(a)

Includes
                a premium of approximately $13 million associated with the remarketing
                feature of the 5.70% REset Put Securities due 2035.

(b)

Repayment
                includes $30 million that was used to settle a related cross-currency
                swap.

Debt
      issued during 2005 had stated interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 9.0% and
      maturities from 2005 through 2035. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
      for more detailed information regarding PPL's financing activities.

Forecasted
      Sources of Cash

PPL
      expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near
      term, including various credit facilities, commercial paper programs, an
      asset-backed commercial paper program and operating leases. PPL also expects
      to
      continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets, as necessary, for
      its long-term financing needs.

Credit
      Facilities

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL's total committed borrowing capacity under credit
      facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
      addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
      agreements contain various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants beyond
      applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
      and/or termination of the agreements. PPL monitors the covenants on a regular
      basis. At December 31, 2005, PPL was in material compliance with those
      covenants. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants and other borrowing
      conditions will not limit access to these funding sources. PPL intends to renew
      and extend $2.5 billion of its credit facility capacity in 2006. See Note 8
      to
      the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL's credit
      facilities.

Commercial
      Paper

PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric maintain commercial paper programs for up to
      $500
      million for PPL Energy Supply and for up to $200 million for PPL Electric to
      provide them each with an additional financing source to fund their short-term
      liquidity needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported
      by certain credit agreements of each company. PPL Energy Supply had $100 million
      of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005, and no commercial paper
      outstanding at December 31, 2004. PPL Electric had no commercial paper
      outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004. During 2006, PPL Energy Supply and
      PPL Electric may issue commercial paper from time to time to facilitate
      short-term cash flow needs.

Asset-Backed
      Commercial Paper Program

PPL
      Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
      PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
      receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary
      on
      an ongoing basis. The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of up
      to
      an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a
      financial institution. PPL Electric uses the proceeds from the program for
      general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of credit. At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the loan balance outstanding was $42 million, all
      of
      which was being used to cash collateralize letters of credit. See Note 8 to
      the
      Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial
      paper
      program.

Operating
      Leases

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through
      operating leases. PPL's subsidiaries lease vehicles, office space, land,
      buildings, personal computers and other equipment. These leasing structures
      provide PPL with additional operating and financing flexibility. The operating
      leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as
      maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of
      rent and other fees. Failure to meet these covenants could limit or restrict
      access to these funds or require early payment of obligations. At this time,
      PPL
      believes that these covenants will not limit access to these funding sources
      or
      cause acceleration or termination of the leases.

PPL,
      through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units
      and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating
      leases. These operating leases are not recorded on PPL's Balance Sheet, which
      is
      in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The leases place certain
      restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets
      and
      declare dividends. At this time, PPL believes that these restrictions will
      not
      limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination
      of
      the leases. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of other
      dividend restrictions related to PPL subsidiaries.

See
      Note
      10 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
      leases.

Long-Term
      Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
      to market conditions in 2006, PPL and its subsidiaries currently plan to issue
      approximately $1.1 billion in long-term debt securities and $250 million in
      preferred securities. PPL expects to use the proceeds primarily to fund capital
      expenditures, to fund maturities of existing debt and for general corporate
      purposes. PPL currently does not plan to issue any significant amounts of common
      stock in 2006.

Forecasted
      Uses of Cash

In
      addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
      purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL currently expects to incur future
      cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment
      of dividends on its common and preferred securities and possibly the repurchase
      of a portion of its common stock, beginning in 2009.

Capital
      Expenditures

The
      table
      below shows PPL's actual spending for the year 2005 and current capital
      expenditure projections for the years 2006 through 2010.

(a)

Construction
                expenditures include AFUDC and capitalized interest, which are expected
                to
                be approximately $151 million for the 2006-2010 period.

(b)

This
                information excludes any potential investments by PPL Global and
                PPL
                Development Company for new
                projects.

PPL's
      capital expenditure projections for the years 2006-2010 total approximately
      $5.8
      billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes
      in market and regulatory conditions. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements
      for
      additional information regarding the installation costs of sulfur dioxide
      scrubbers and other pollution control equipment, which comprise most of the
      "Environmental" expenditures noted above.

PPL
      plans
      to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2006 with cash on hand, cash from
      operations, and, when necessary, the issuance of debt securities.

Contractual
      Obligations

PPL
      has
      assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course
      of
      conducting its business. At December 31, 2005, the estimated contractual cash
      obligations of PPL were:

(a)

Reflects
                principal maturities only, including maturities of consolidated lease
                debt. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
                conversion triggers related to PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible
                Senior Notes. Also, see Note 8 for a discussion of the remarketing
                feature
                related to PPL Energy Supply's 5.70% REset Put
                Securities.

(b)

The
                payments reflected herein are subject to change, as certain purchase
                obligations included are estimates based on projected obligated quantities
                and/or projected pricing under the contracts. Purchase orders made
                in the
                ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented.
                Includes obligations related to nuclear fuel and the installation
                of the
                scrubbers, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table
                presented above.

(c)

The
                amounts reflected represent estimated deficit pension funding requirements
                arising from an actuarial valuation performed in March 2004 and do
                not
                include pension funding requirements for future
                service.

Dividends

In
      December 2004, PPL's Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy that provides
      for growing the common stock dividend in the future at a rate exceeding the
      projected rate of growth in earnings per share from ongoing operations until
      the
      dividend payout ratio reaches the 50 percent level, which PPL expects to occur
      in 2006. Earnings from ongoing operations exclude items that management
      considers unusual. In February 2006, PPL announced its expectation that the
      growth rate of its dividends over the next few years will continue to exceed
      the
      growth rate in the company's earnings per share and, therefore, result in a
      dividend payout ratio above 50 percent after 2006. Any future dividends are
      subject to the Board of Directors' quarterly dividend declarations, based on
      the
      company's financial position and other relevant considerations at the
      time.

PPL
      Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
      preferred stock, and to pay quarterly dividends on the preferred securities
      expected to be issued in 2006, in each case if and as declared by its Board
      of
      Directors.

Common
      Stock Repurchase

Given
      the
      continued improvement in its credit profile, PPL expects to be in a position
      to
      repurchase a portion of its common stock beginning in 2009.

Credit
      Ratings

Moody's,
      S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
      preferred securities of PPL and its subsidiaries. Based on their respective
      reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions.

A
      credit
      rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit worthiness
      associated with particular securities issued by PPL and its subsidiaries based
      on information provided by PPL and other sources. The ratings of Moody's,
      S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities
      of PPL or its subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or
      withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently
      of
      each other and any other rating that may be assigned to their securities. A
      downgrade in PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher
      borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets.

The
      following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL and its key subsidiaries
      at
      December 31, 2005.

(a)

Insured
                as to payment of principal and interest.

(b)

All
                Issuer Ratings for Fitch are "Issuer Default
                Ratings."

The
      rating agencies took the following actions on the debt and preferred securities
      of PPL and its subsidiaries in 2005 and through February 2006:

Moody's

In
      June
      2005, Moody's revised its outlooks to stable from negative on the senior
      unsecured debt and issuer ratings of WPDH Limited, the senior unsecured debt
      ratings of WPD LLP and the subordinated unsecured debt ratings of WPD LLP's
      unconsolidated subsidiary SIUK Capital Trust I. Moody's indicated that this
      positive change to the financial profiles resulted from a reduction in
      consolidated adjusted leverage at the WPD companies as a result of the
      redeployment to WPD of surplus cash from Latin American subsidiaries of PPL
      and
      from PPL's commitment to suspend its dividend from WPDH Limited in 2005. At
      the
      same time, Moody's affirmed the WPD companies' long-term and short-term credit
      rating. The outlook on the debt ratings of WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South
      West) was already stable.

S&P

In
      January 2005, S&P affirmed PPL Electric's A-/A-2 corporate credit ratings
      and favorably revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative
      following the authorization of a $194 million rate increase by the PUC. S&P
      indicated that the outlook revision reflects its expectations that the rate
      increase, effective January 1, 2005, will allow for material improvement in
      PPL Electric's financial profile, which had lagged S&P's expectations in
      recent years. S&P indicated that the stable outlook reflects its
      expectations that PPL Electric "will rapidly improve and then maintain financial
      metrics more consistent with its ratings." S&P indicated that it expects PPL
      Electric's operations to remain stable through the expiration of the PLR
      agreement.

Additionally,
      in January 2005, S&P revised its outlooks on the WPD companies to stable
      from negative. S&P attributed this positive change to financial profile
      improvements resulting from the final regulatory outcome published by Ofgem
      in
      November 2004. At the same time, S&P affirmed the WPD companies' long-term
      and short-term credit ratings.

In
      October 2005, S&P affirmed its BBB corporate credit rating of PPL and also
      affirmed its ratings of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and PPL Montana. The
      ratings affirmation is the result of S&P's annual review of PPL, including
      its business and financial risk profiles.

Fitch

In
      January 2005, Fitch announced that it downgraded the WPD companies' senior
      unsecured credit ratings by one notch:

·

WPDH
                Limited to BBB- from BBB;

·

WPD
                LLP to BBB from BBB+; and

·

WPD
                (South Wales) and WPD (South West) to BBB+/F2 from
                A-/F1.

Fitch
      stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension-adjusted
      leverage at WPD. Fitch acknowledged that WPD's funding plan should reduce its
      pension deficit over time, and it expects WPD to proceed with its de-leveraging
      program. However, Fitch indicated that it is not certain enough, due to the
      unpredictability in future pension valuations, that pension-adjusted leverage
      will support a BBB rating at WPDH Limited. Fitch indicated that WPD (South
      Wales) and WPD (South West) have been downgraded to maintain a two-notch
      differential with WPDH Limited because Fitch does not believe that WPD's
      financial ring-fencing is restrictive enough to support a three-notch
      differential.

In
      December 2005, Fitch affirmed PPL Montana's amortizing Pass-Through
      Certificates, the last of which are due 2020, at BBB. Fitch indicated that
      the
      rating reflects PPL Montana's credit quality on a stand-alone
      basis.

In
      December 2005, Fitch assigned issuer default ratings (IDRs) for its North
      American global power portfolio of issuers with ratings of BB- or higher. The
      IDR reflects Fitch's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its
      financial commitments on a timely basis, effectively becoming its benchmark
      probability of default. Fitch rates securities in an issuer's capital structure
      higher, lower or the same as the IDR based on Fitch's assessment of a particular
      security's relative recovery prospects. There were no changes in Fitch's
      securities ratings at PPL, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Energy Supply or PPL
      Electric as a result of Fitch's assignment of an IDR.

In
      February 2006, Fitch's Europe, Middle East and Africa group implemented IDRs
      based on its new IDR methodology. This implementation led to Fitch's assignment
      of the following IDRs and Fitch's revision of its ratings on the following
      securities currently outstanding at WPD and its affiliates.

·

WPDH
                Limited IDR of BBB- and senior unsecured rating to BBB from
                BBB-;

·

WPD
                LLP IDR of BBB, senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB and preferred
                stock rating to BBB from BBB-; and

·

WPD
                (South Wales) and WPD (South West) IDR of BBB+ and senior unsecured
                debt
                rating to A- from BBB+.

Fitch's
      outlook for WPD and its affiliates remains stable.

Ratings
      Triggers

PPL
      Energy Supply's $400 million of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are
      convertible upon the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term
      credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB
      and Ba2, or either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes. The terms of
      the notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of
      the
      notes. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning
      the Convertible Senior Notes.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity exposures caused
      by a
      ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would accelerate the due dates
      of borrowings. However, if PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's debt ratings had been
      below investment grade at December 31, 2005, PPL and PPL Energy Supply would
      have had to post an additional $128 million of collateral to
      counterparties.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements

PPL
      provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements
      that enable certain transactions. Some of the guarantees contain financial
      and
      other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated
      affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, require early
      maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability
      to
      enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants
      will not limit access to the relevant funding sources.

PPL
      has
      entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of FIN
      45,
      "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
      Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB
      Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34."
      See
      Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion on guarantees.

Risk
      Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
      Risk

Background

Market
      risk is the potential loss PPL may incur as a result of price changes associated
      with a particular financial or commodity instrument. PPL is exposed to market
      risk from:

PPL
      has a
      risk management policy approved by its Board of Directors to manage market
      risk
      and counterparty credit risk. (Credit risk is discussed below.) The RMC,
      comprised of senior management and chaired by the Vice President-Risk
      Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities
      designed to monitor compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs
      include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of
      transactions and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits,
      sensitivity analyses, daily portfolio reporting, including open positions,
      mark-to-market valuations and other risk measurement metrics.

The
      forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may
      occur
      in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance
      on
      model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those
      presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future
      losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses.

Contract
      Valuation

PPL
      utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and tolling
      agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated
      fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price, interest rate and foreign
      currency volatility.

When
      available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a
      commodity or financial instrument. This may include exchange prices, the average
      mid-point bid/ask spreads obtained from brokers, or an independent valuation
      by
      an external source, such as a bank. However, market prices for energy or
      energy-related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market
      illiquidity. If no active trading market exists, contracts are valued using
      internally developed models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal
      group. Although PPL believes that its valuation methods are reasonable, changes
      in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values
      and
      realization in future periods.

To
      record
      energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL discounts the forward values using
      the U.S. Utility BBB+ Curve. Additionally, PPL adjusts derivative carrying
      values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential
      illiquidity in the market:

Accounting
      and Reporting

To
      account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
      follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
      and
      Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
      Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," and SFAS 149, "Amendment of
      Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and interpreted
      by DIG issues (together, "SFAS 133"), EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting
      for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in
      Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," and EITF 03-11, "Reporting
      Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB
      Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No.
      02-3." SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair
      value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability (unless they meet SFAS
      133's
      criteria for exclusion) and that changes in the derivative's fair value be
      recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
      are
      met.

In
      April
      2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which amends and clarifies SFAS 133 to improve
      financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging
      activities. To ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are
      accounted for similarly, SFAS 149 clarified the circumstances under which a
      contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a
      derivative, clarified when a derivative contains a financing component, amended
      the definition of an "underlying" and amended certain other existing
      pronouncements.

Additionally,
      SFAS 149 placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or
      normal sale exception. SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or
      modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except
      certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when-issued
      securities or other securities that did not yet exist.

PPL
      adopted SFAS 149 as of July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have
      a
      significant impact on PPL.

In
      accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL reflects its net realized and unrealized gains
      and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes
      in
      the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statement of Income. Non-derivative
      contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by
      EITF 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
      Management Activities" are reflected in the financial statements using the
      accrual method of accounting. Under the accrual method of accounting, unrealized
      gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements.

PPL
      adopted the final provisions of EITF 03-11 prospectively as of October 1, 2003.
      As a result of this adoption, non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at
      major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales
      at
      those same delivery points. A major market delivery point is any delivery point
      with liquid pricing available. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for
      the
      impact of the adoption of EITF 03-11.

PPL's
      short-term derivative contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets"
      and "Price risk management liabilities" on the Balance Sheet. Long-term
      derivative contracts are included in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets
      -
      Other" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other."

Accounting
      Designation

Energy
      contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
      treatment. For energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the
      circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are
      entered into determine their accounting designation. In addition to
      energy-related transactions, PPL enters into financial interest rate and foreign
      currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing
      and anticipated debt issuances. PPL also enters into foreign currency swap
      contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign
      currency and net investments in foreign operations. As with energy transactions,
      the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine
      a
      contract's accounting designation. These designations are verified by a separate
      internal group on a daily basis. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for
      a
      summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are
      responsible for the designation of derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
      Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
      price risk is one of PPL's most significant risks due to the level of investment
      that PPL maintains in its generation assets, coupled with the volatility of
      prices for energy and energy-related products. Several factors influence price
      levels and volatilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal
      changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within
      regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions,
      market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal
      and
      state regulations. To hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL's
      energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL
      EnergyPlus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under
      FERC
      market-based tariffs throughout the U.S. and enters into financial
      exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. Because PPL owns or controls
      generating assets, the majority of PPL's energy transactions qualify for accrual
      or hedge accounting. Additionally, the non-trading portfolio includes the fair
      value of options that are economic hedges of PPL's synthetic fuel tax credits.
      Although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment, these options are
      considered non-trading.

Within
      PPL's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges
      on the expected value of PPL's generation. To address this risk, PPL takes
      a
      conservative approach in determining the number of MWhs that are available
      to be
      sold forward. In this regard, PPL reduces the maximum potential output that
      a
      plant may produce by three factors - planned maintenance, unplanned outages
      and
      economic conditions. The potential output of a plant is first reduced by the
      amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular
      unit. Another reduction, representing the unplanned outage rate, is the amount
      of MWhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to such factors as
      equipment breakage. Finally, the potential output of certain plants (such as
      peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of production will not
      allow
      them to economically run during all hours.

PPL's
      non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts. The
      net
      obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute. PPL analyzes
      historical on-peak and off-peak usage patterns, as well as spot prices and
      weather patterns, to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that
      best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility. On a
      forward basis, PPL reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements
      energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated
      usage patterns and energy peaks. Anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks
      are
      affected by expected load changes, regional economic drivers and
      seasonality.

PPL's
      non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various times through
      2010.
      The following chart sets forth PPL's net fair market value of these contracts
      as
      of December 31.

The
      following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL's non-trading commodity
      derivative contracts at December 31, 2005, based on whether the fair values
      are
      determined by quoted market prices or other more subjective means.

The
      "Prices actively quoted" category includes the fair value of exchange-traded
      natural gas futures contracts quoted on the NYMEX, which has currently quoted
      prices through 2011.

The
      "Prices provided by other external sources" category includes PPL's forward
      positions and options in natural gas and power and natural gas basis swaps
      at
      points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker quotes are available. The fair
      value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid/ask
      spreads obtained through OTC brokers. On average, OTC quotes for forwards and
      swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the
      future.

The
      "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the
      value
      of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed
      as
      a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of
      the
      market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC
      broker.

Because
      of PPL's efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets,
      PPL sells electricity and buys fuel on a forward basis, resulting in open
      contractual positions. If PPL were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy
      or
      to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances
      it could be required to pay damages. These damages would be based on the
      difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity.
      Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages
      could be significant. Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages,
      transmission disruptions, non-performance by counterparties (or their own
      counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could
      affect PPL's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases
      in
      the market price of replacement energy. Although PPL attempts to mitigate these
      risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm
      obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform,
      or that it will not experience counterparty non-performance in the
      future.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
      across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value
      of
      the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by approximately $275
      million, compared with a decrease of $165 million at December 31, 2004. For
      purposes of this calculation, an increase in the market price for electricity
      is
      considered an adverse movement because PPL's electricity portfolio is generally
      in a net sales position, and the decrease in the market price for fuel is
      considered an adverse movement because PPL's commodity fuels portfolio is
      generally in a net purchase position. PPL enters into those commodity contracts
      to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity.

In
      accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL does not completely hedge its
      generation output or fuel requirements. PPL estimates that for its entire
      portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical and financial energy
      positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones
      and
      time periods would decrease expected 2006 gross margins by $18 million.
      Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices would decrease
      gross margins by $10 million.

Commodity
      Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
      also
      executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities. As a
      result, PPL may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could
      result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction
      anticipated. The margins from these trading activities are shown in the
      Statement of Income as "Net energy trading margins."

PPL's
      trading contracts mature at various times through 2009. The following chart
      sets
      forth PPL's net fair market value of trading contracts as of December
      31.

PPL
      will
      reverse approximately $1 million of the $5 million unrealized trading gains
      over
      the first three months of 2006 as the transactions are realized.

The
      following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL's trading portfolio
      at
      December 31, 2005, based on whether the fair values are determined by quoted
      market prices or other more subjective means.

See
      "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)" for information on the various sources
      of
      fair value.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
      across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value
      of
      the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $23 million, compared with
      a
      decrease of $5 million at December 31, 2004.

Interest
      Rate Risk

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations. PPL utilizes
      various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating
      interest rates in its debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio
      and lock in U.S. Treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries)
      in
      anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk
      management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in
      interest expense and changes in the fair value of PPL's debt portfolio due
      to
      changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL's potential annual exposure to increased interest
      expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was estimated at $7 million,
      compared with a $4 million exposure at December 31, 2004.

PPL
      is
      also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international
      debt
      portfolios. At December 31, 2005, PPL estimated that its potential exposure
      to a
      change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement
      in interest rates, was approximately $200 million, compared with $216 million
      at
      December 31, 2004.

PPL
      utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the
      expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments. These risks
      include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable
      rate debt and for future anticipated financing. While PPL is exposed to changes
      in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these
      instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the
      same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. At December
      31,
      2005, the market value of these instruments, representing the amount PPL would
      receive upon their termination, was approximately $6 million. At December 31,
      2005, PPL estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value
      of
      these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in the hedged exposure, was
      approximately $7 million, compared with a $2 million exposure at December 31,
      2004.

PPL
      also
      utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and
      floating interest rates in its debt portfolio. While PPL is exposed to changes
      in the fair value of these instruments, any change in market value is recorded
      with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged.
      At
      December 31, 2005, PPL estimated that its potential exposure to a change in
      the
      fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in interest
      rates, was approximately $12 million, compared with a $19 million exposure
      at
      December 31, 2004.

Foreign
      Currency Risk

PPL
      is
      exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in affiliates
      in
      the U.K. and Latin America. In addition, PPL may make purchases of equipment
      in
      currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL
      has
      adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain
      foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or
      liabilities and net investments. In addition, PPL enters into financial
      instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk.

To
      protect expected income in Chilean pesos, PPL entered into an average rate
      forward for 8 billion Chilean pesos. The settlement date of this forward is
      November 2006. At December 31, 2005, the market value of this position,
      representing the amount PPL would pay upon its termination, was insignificant.
      PPL estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market value of
      these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates,
      was
      insignificant at December 31, 2005.

WPDH
      Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $1.1 billion
      to
      hedge the interest payments and value of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds
      with
      maturity dates ranging from December 2006 to December 2028. The estimated value
      of this position at December 31, 2005, being the amount PPL would pay to
      terminate it, including accrued interest, was approximately $164 million.

PPL
      estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market value of these
      instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates, was
      approximately $140 million at December 31, 2005.

On
      the
      Statement of Income, gains and losses associated with hedges of interest
      payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in "Interest Expense."
      Gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in
      "Depreciation." Gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain
      in
      "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the Balance Sheet until the investment
      is disposed.

Nuclear
      Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
      connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
      to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna station. As of
      December 31, 2005, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity
      securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair
      value on PPL's Balance Sheet. The mix of securities is designed to provide
      returns to be used to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate
      for
      inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. However, the equity securities
      included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets,
      and
      the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in
      interest rates. PPL Susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance
      and
      periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear
      decommissioning trust policy statement. At December 31, 2005, a
      hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices
      would have resulted in an estimated $33 million reduction in the fair value
      of
      the trust assets, compared with a $30 million reduction at December 31,
      2004. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
      the
      nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Synthetic
      Fuel Tax Credit Risk

Recent
      increases in and the volatility of crude oil prices threaten to reduce the
      amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that PPL expects to receive through its
      synthetic fuel production. The tax credits are reduced if the annual average
      wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase-out range. The tax
      credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds the phase-out range.
      See
      "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax Credits" in Note 14 to the
      Financial Statements for more information regarding the phase-out of the tax
      credits.

PPL
      implemented a risk management objective to hedge a portion of the variability
      of
      cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel tax credits by
      hedging the risk that the 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead price for
      domestic crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

PPL
      purchased options in 2005 to mitigate some of the reductions in synthetic fuel
      tax credits if the annual average wellhead price for 2006 and 2007 falls within
      the applicable phase-out range. These positions did not qualify for hedge
      accounting treatment. The mark-to-market value of these positions as of December
      31, 2005, was a gain of $10 million, and is reflected in "Energy-related
      businesses" revenues on the Statement of Income.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
      of
      crude oil would have decreased the value of the synthetic fuel hedges by $24
      million. For purposes of this calculation, a decrease in the market price for
      crude oil is considered an adverse movement.

Credit
      Risk

Credit
      risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL would incur as a result of
      non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. PPL
      maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties
      (including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings
      criteria) and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or
      collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.
      However, PPL has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric
      utilities, natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and
      trading companies. These concentrations of counterparties may impact PPL's
      overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that
      counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory
      or
      other conditions. As discussed above in "Contract Valuation," PPL records
      certain non-performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty
      with contracts that are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint)
      will default in its performance. In this case, PPL would have to sell into
      a
      lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced market. These reserves
      are
      reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in "Price risk management assets"
      on the Balance Sheet. PPL also records reserves to reflect the probability
      that
      a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries PPL has made but not yet
      billed. These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance
      Sheet. PPL also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales to
      the
      California ISO for which PPL has not yet been paid, as well as a reserve related
      to PPL's exposure as a result of the Enron bankruptcy, which are reflected
      in
      "Accounts receivable" on the Balance Sheet. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Financial
      Statements.

Application
      of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL's
      financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods,
      assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting
      policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to the
      financial condition or results of operations of PPL, and require estimates
      or
      other judgments of matters inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or
      other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a
      significant change to the information presented in the financial statements.
      (These accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
      Statements.) PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting
      policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with its Audit
      Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed the following
      disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies
      with
      the Audit Committee.

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefits

PPL
      follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and
      SFAS
      106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
      when accounting for these pension and other postretirement benefits. Under
      these
      accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit
      obligations and the performance of plan assets. Delayed recognition of
      differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a
      guiding principle of these standards. This delayed recognition of actual results
      allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan
      performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.
      The primary assumptions are:

In
      selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement
      plans, PPL starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for
      its plans. This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve.
      A
      portfolio of nearly 600 Moody's Aa-graded non-callable corporate bonds, with
      a
      total outstanding float in excess of $300 billion, serves as the base from
      which
      those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate
      yield curve. The results of this analysis are considered in conjunction with
      other economic data and consideration of movements in the Moody's Aa bond index
      to determine the discount rate assumption. At December 31, 2005, PPL
      decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from 5.75% to 5.70% as a
      result of this assessment.

The
      selection of a discount rate for the international pension plans of WPD again
      starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment streams. This
      information is analyzed against yields on long-term high-quality corporate
      bonds
      within the iBoxx index. Due to the flatness of U.K. yield curves, the
      duration-weighted discount rate is approximately the same. At December 31,
      2005,
      PPL decreased the discount rate for its international pension plans from 5.50%
      to 4.75% as a result of this assessment.

In
      selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
      past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by
      the
      plans. At December 31, 2005, PPL's expected return on plan assets was decreased
      from 8.75% to 8.50% for its domestic pension plans and increased to 8.00% from
      7.90% for its other postretirement benefit plans. For its international plans,
      PPL's expected return on plan assets was reduced from 8.30% to 8.09% at December
      31, 2005. Both PPL's domestic and international pension plans have significantly
      exceeded the expected return on plan assets for 2004 and 2005. However, the
      expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased to reflect a long-term
      view of equity markets and an expected increase in long-term bond
      yields.

In
      selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
      light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2005, PPL's rate of
      compensation increase was changed to 4.75% from 4.00% for its domestic plans.
      For its international plans, PPL's rate of compensation increase remained at
      3.75% at December 31, 2005.

In
      selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
      forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2005, PPL's health care
      cost trend rates were 10.0% for 2006, gradually declining to 5.5% for
      2011.

A
      variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
      projected benefit obligations, accrued pension and other postretirement benefit
      liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement
      benefit cost and other comprehensive income (OCI). The following chart reflects
      the sensitivities in the 2005 financial statements associated with a change
      in
      certain assumptions. While the chart below reflects either an increase or
      decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the
      projected benefit obligation, accrued pension and other postretirement benefit
      liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement
      benefit cost and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite direction. Each
      sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change
      in that assumption.

(a)

Excludes
                the impact of additional minimum liability.

(b)

Only
                impacts other postretirement
                benefits.

PPL's
      total net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation as of December
      31,
      2005, was $853 million. PPL recognized an aggregate net accrued pension and
      other postretirement benefit liability of $429 million on its Balance Sheet
      as
      of December 31, 2005. The total obligation is not fully reflected in the current
      financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting
      standards for these obligations.

In
      2005,
      PPL recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged
      to
      operating expenses of $51 million. This amount represents a $44 million increase
      from 2004. This increase in expense was primarily attributable to PPL's
      international plans and was the result of the decrease in the discount rate
      at
      December 31, 2004, and recognition of prior losses.

The
      pension plans of WPD have accumulated deferred losses of $721 million as of
      December 31, 2005, as a result of changes in the discount rate assumption,
      expected compared with actual asset returns and changes in demographic
      assumptions and experience. The losses, to the extent not offset by future
      gains, will be amortized in accordance with PPL's policy regarding recognition
      of gains and losses as detailed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.

Strong
      asset returns and falling foreign currency conversion rates offset the impact
      of
      the decrease in the discount rate, allowing PPL to reduce its additional minimum
      pension liability for its international pension plans, offset by a modest
      increase for PPL's domestic pension plans. Recording the change in the
      additional minimum liability resulted in a $19 million decrease to the
      pension-related charge to OCI, net of taxes, translation adjustment and
      unrecognized prior service costs, with no effect on net income. The
      pension-related balance in OCI, which is a reduction to shareowners' equity,
      was
      reduced from $368 million at December 31, 2004, to $349 million at December
      31,
      2005. The charges to OCI will reverse in future periods if the fair value of
      trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation.

      to
      Note 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding pension
      and other postretirement benefits.

3)

Asset
                Impairment

PPL
      performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including intangibles,
      that
      are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with SFAS 144,
      "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." PPL tests
      for
      impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a
      long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such
      events or changes in circumstances are:

For
      a
      long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the
      sum
      of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
      eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment
      loss
      is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.

In
      determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
      estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
      value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets. Changes in
      assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result
      in
      significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the
      financial statements. For determining fair value, the FASB has indicated that
      quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.
      However, when market prices are unavailable, other valuation techniques may
      be
      used. PPL has generally used a present value technique (i.e., discounted cash
      flow). Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams
      and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the
      cash flow streams.

PPL
      has
      determined that, when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying
      value of a long-lived asset are being considered, it uses estimated cash flows
      from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is
      clearly the most likely outcome. If no scenario is clearly most likely, then
      a
      probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash
      flows from the alternative scenarios. For assets tested for impairment as of
      the
      balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test
      consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet
      date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the
      assets. That assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised based
      on events that occur after the balance sheet date.

During
      2005, PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas-fired generation assets
      for
      impairment, as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of
      these assets may not be recoverable. PPL did not record an impairment of these
      gas-fired generation assets in 2005. For these impairment analyses, the most
      significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows. PPL estimates
      future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted
      for any recent sale or purchase commitments. Key factors that impact cash flows
      include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sale and
      purchase commitments. A 10% decrease in estimated future cash flows for the
      gas-fired generation assets would not have resulted in an impairment charge.

PPL
      performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets." PPL performs an annual impairment test for
      goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
      that
      the asset might be impaired.

SFAS
      requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
      PPL
      has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating
      segments.

Goodwill
      is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the
      goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
      with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of
      a
      reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
      considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value
      of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of
      impairment loss, if any.

The
      second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. The
      implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
      of
      goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a
      reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit
      as
      if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the
      estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the
      reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
      over
      the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
      of
      goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared
      with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the
      implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
      that
      excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting
      unit's goodwill.

PPL
      completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005.
      This test did not require any second-step assessments and did not result in
      any
      impairments. PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill
      impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. PPL
      estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows. Although
      a
      full two-step evaluation was not completed, a decrease in the forecasted cash
      flows of 10% or an increase of the discount rates by 50 basis points would
      have
      resulted in the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeding their
      estimated fair values, indicating a potential impairment of
      goodwill.

4)

Leasing

PPL
      applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," to all leasing
      transactions. In addition, PPL applies the provisions of numerous other
      accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the EITF that provide specific
      guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing
      arrangements. In general, there are two types of leases from a lessee's
      perspective: operating leases - leases accounted for off-balance sheet; and
      capital leases - leases capitalized on the balance sheet.

In
      accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
      discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
      useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating
      or
      capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
      whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease,
      thus
      significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
      statements.

In
      addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
      transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
      they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
      accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
      assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment
      for
      book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
      and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
      transaction. In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the Colstrip
      generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to PPL Montana
      under four 36-year operating leases. This transaction is accounted for as an
      operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale/leaseback
      arrangements. If for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements
      for off-balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale/leaseback, PPL would
      have recorded approximately $270 million of additional assets and approximately
      $318 million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at December 31,
      2005, and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at $7
      million, after-tax, in 2005.

See
      Note
      10 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
      leases.

5)

Loss
                Accruals

PPL
      periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions,
      situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. These events are
      called "contingencies," and PPL's accounting for such events is prescribed
      by
      SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and other related accounting guidance.
      SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of
      circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise
      that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail
      to
      occur."

For
      loss
      contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
      indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
      of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
      estimated. FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events
      are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies that
      might result in gains. PPL continuously assesses potential loss contingencies
      for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income taxes, regulatory
      penalties and other events.

PPL
      also
      has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
      events have occurred. For example, estimated losses were accrued when long-term
      purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and

when
      PPL
      Electric's generation business was deregulated. Under regulatory accounting,
      PPL
      Electric recorded the above-market cost of energy purchases from NUGs as part
      of
      its purchased power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs were
      recovered in regulated rates. When the generation business was deregulated,
      the
      estimated loss associated with these long-term purchase commitments to make
      above-market NUG purchases was recorded because PPL Electric was committed
      to
      purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover
      these
      costs in regulated rates.

The
      accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
      identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
      events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
      as
      to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
      of
      accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL's
      management.

Initial
      Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
      uses
      its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers, tax specialists
      and
      engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has
      been
      incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Two
      significant loss accruals were recorded in 2005. The first was the loss accrual
      related to the PJM billing dispute. The second involved the accrual of
      remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the Martins Creek
      generating station. Significant judgment was required by PPL's management to
      perform the initial assessment of these contingencies.

See
      Note
      14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on both of these
      contingencies and see "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a
      discussion of the year-end 2005 assessments of these contingencies.

PPL
      has
      identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but that do
      not
      meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS 5 requires disclosure,
      but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably possible" that
      a
      loss has been incurred. The FASB defines "reasonably possible" as cases in
      which
      "the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but
      less
      than likely." See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other
      potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under
      SFAS 5.

Reducing
      Recorded Loss Accruals

When
      an
      estimated loss is accrued, PPL identifies, where applicable, the triggering
      events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering events
      generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss
      is
      incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated. The
      following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
      of
      certain recorded loss accruals:

The
      largest loss accrual on PPL's balance sheet, and the loss accrual that changed
      most significantly in 2005, was for an impairment of above-market NUG purchase
      commitments. This loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between the
      above-market contract terms, under the purchase commitments, and the fair value
      of the electricity to be purchased. This loss accrual was originally recorded
      at
      $854 million in 1998, when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.

When
      the
      loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
      established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced.
      A
      schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases
      over the lives of the NUG contracts. This loss accrual was transferred to PPL
      EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000, corporate realignment. PPL EnergyPlus continues
      to reduce the above-market NUG liability based on the aforementioned schedule.
      As PPL EnergyPlus reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases,
      it
      offsets the actual cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power
      purchase expense more in line with expected market prices. The above-market
      loss
      accrual was $206 million at December 31, 2005. This loss accrual will be
      significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts expires.
      The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in 2014.

Ongoing
      Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
      reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded
      potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing communication
      and
      analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, tax specialists,
      operation management and other parties.

Significant
      management judgment is required in developing PPL's contingencies, or reserves,
      for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The ongoing
      assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management's best
      estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year. Annual tax
      provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may
      result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities.
      However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by
      such
      authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In evaluating the exposure
      associated with various filing positions, PPL accounts for changes in probable
      exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount that should be
      recognized. An allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies, the balance
      of
      which management believes to be adequate. The ongoing assessment of valuation
      allowances is based on an assessment of whether deferred tax assets will
      ultimately be realized. Management considers a number of factors in assessing
      the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets, including forecasts of taxable
      income in future periods.

As
      part
      of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL's management
      re-assessed the loss accruals recorded earlier in the year for the two
      contingencies described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of
      the
      Loss Accrual." See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional
      information.

·

In
                re-assessing the PJM billing dispute, PPL's management considered
                the
                proposed settlement agreement that was filed with FERC in September
                2005.
                Under the settlement agreement, PPL Electric would pay $33 million
                plus
                interest over a four-year period to PJM through a new transmission
                charge
                that, under applicable law, is recoverable from PPL Electric's retail
                customers. Also, all PJM market participants would pay approximately
                $8
                million plus interest over a four-year period to PJM through a new
                market
                adjustment charge. PJM would forward amounts collected under the
                two new
                charges to PECO. Numerous parties filed comments with the FERC opposing
                the settlement agreement, and the FERC has not yet acted on the proposed
                settlement agreement. Accordingly, PPL's management had no basis
                to revise
                the loss accrual that was recorded in the first quarter of 2005.
                PPL's
                management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency
                in future periods.

·

PPL
                also re-assessed the contingency for the Martins Creek ash basin
                remediation. Based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications
                with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies, PPL's management
                concluded that $48 million was currently the best estimate of the
                cost of
                the remediation effort. Therefore, PPL revised the loss accrual in
                the
                fourth quarter of 2005. PPL cannot predict the final cost of assessment
                and remediation of the leak, the outcome of the action initiated
                by the
                Pennsylvania DEP or the action initiated by the Delaware Riverside
                Conservancy and several citizens, the outcome of the natural resource
                damage assessment, the exact nature of any other regulatory or other
                legal
                actions that may be initiated against PPL as a result of the disposal
                basin leak, the extent of the fines or damages that may be sought
                in
                connection with any such actions or the ultimate financial impact
                on PPL.
                PPL's management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this
                contingency in future periods.

Asset
                Retirement Obligations

SFAS
      143,
      "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
      associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
      liability in the financial statements. The initial obligation should be measured
      at the estimated fair value. An equivalent amount should be recorded as an
      increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over
      the
      useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability should
      be increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income
      statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of
      time.

FIN
      47,
      "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation
      of
      FASB Statement No. 143," which was issued in March 2005, and adopted by PPL
      effective December 31, 2005, clarified the term conditional ARO as used in
      SFAS
      143. FIN 47 specified that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred
      if
      the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. See Note 21 for further
      discussion of the impact of FIN 47 on PPL.

In
      determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates
      to
      calculate fair value. Fair value is developed through consideration of estimated
      retirement costs in today's dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement
      date
      and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in
      assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value
      of
      AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified
      and
      recorded in the financial statements.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL had AROs totaling $298 million recorded on the Balance
      Sheet. PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted
      retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates. A variance in
      the
      forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or the inflation rates could
      have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The
      following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the ARO liabilities as
      of
      December 31, 2005, associated with a change in these assumptions at the time
      of
      initial recognition. There is no significant change to the ARO asset values,
      depreciation expense of the ARO assets or accretion expense of the ARO
      liabilities as a result of changing the assumptions. Each sensitivity below
      reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
      assumption.

PPL
      ENERGY SUPPLY, LLC

ITEM
      7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
      OF
      OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
      Energy Supply is an energy company with headquarters in Allentown, PA. See
      "Item
      1. Business - Background," for descriptions of PPL Energy Supply's domestic
      and
      international businesses. PPL Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply
      and
      International Delivery. See Exhibit 99(a) in Item 15 for a listing of its
      principal subsidiaries. Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply is primarily
      engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets -
      the
      northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity in the U.K.
      and Latin America. PPL Energy Supply's overall strategy is to achieve
      disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both
      cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in regulated
      international delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong
      customer and regulatory relations. More specifically, PPL Energy Supply's
      strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match
      energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths
      with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing
      exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk.
      PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its international electricity delivery
      businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost
      while maintaining the highest level of customer service and
      reliability.

PPL
      Energy Supply faces several risks in its generation business. The principal
      risks are electricity wholesale price risk, fuel supply and price risk, power
      plant performance and counterparty credit risk. PPL Energy Supply attempts
      to
      manage these risks through various means. For instance, PPL Energy Supply
      operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography,
      fuel source, cost structure and operating characteristics. PPL Energy Supply
      is
      focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their
      availability. In addition, PPL Energy Supply has in place and continues to
      pursue contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel supply, and other
      means, to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference,
      or margin, between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which PPL
      Energy Supply sells it. Whether PPL Energy Supply decides to, or is able to,
      continue to enter into long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel
      purchase agreements or renew its existing agreements and the market conditions
      at that time will affect its future profitability. Currently, PPL Energy
      Supply's commitments for energy sales are substantially satisfied through its
      own generation assets - i.e., PPL Energy Supply primarily markets and trades
      around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated
      generation, marketing and trading functions. PPL Energy Supply has in place
      risk
      management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage
      its exposure to volatility of earnings and cash flows related to changes in
      energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
      counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating
      units.

PPL
      Energy Supply's international electricity delivery businesses are
      rate-regulated. Accordingly, these businesses are subject to regulatory risk
      in
      terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they
      may collect in customer rates. The principal challenge that PPL Energy Supply
      faces in its international electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high
      standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective manner. PPL
      Energy Supply faces additional financial risks in conducting international
      operations, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. PPL Energy Supply
      attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management programs.

A
      key
      challenge for PPL Energy Supply's business as a whole is to maintain a strong
      credit profile. Investors, analysts and rating agencies that follow companies
      in
      the energy industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity
      position of these companies. PPL Energy Supply continually focuses on
      strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position, thereby
      improving its credit profile.

See
      "Item
      1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning the material risks that PPL
      Energy Supply faces in its businesses.

The
      purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Energy Supply's
      past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing
      the risks and challenges mentioned above. Specifically:

The
      information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL
      Energy Supply's Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

      items are provided within the review of each segment's earnings.

The
      year-to-year changes in earnings components, including domestic gross energy
      margins by region and significant income statement line items, are explained
      in

PPL
      Energy Supply's earnings beyond 2005 are subject to various risks and
      uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1A. Risk Factors,"

Supply
      Segment

The
      Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
      generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
      Supply.

The
      Supply segment results in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflect the reclassification
      of
      the Sundance plant operating losses from certain income statement line items
      to
      "Loss from Discontinued Operations." See Note 9 to the Financial Statements
      for

The
      following items, that management considers unusual, had a significant impact
      on
      the Supply segment earnings.

      Outlook

Based
      on
      current forward energy prices, PPL Energy Supply is projecting higher energy
      margins for the Supply segment in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily driven
      by
      the 8.4% increase in the generation prices under the PLR contracts. Higher
      generation output, higher-priced wholesale energy contracts that replace
      expiring contracts, and lower purchased power costs also are expected to improve
      energy margins. These benefits are expected to be partially offset by increased
      fuel and fuel transportation expenses, higher operation and maintenance expenses
      and reduced earnings from synfuel projects.

International
      Delivery Segment

The
      International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
      businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
      electricity. Virtually all of PPL Global's international businesses are located
      in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia.

      the International Delivery segment earnings.

      Outlook

PPL
      Energy Supply projects that the International Delivery segment will experience
      increased operation and maintenance expenses in 2006 compared with 2005,
      primarily due to higher pension costs at PPL Energy Supply's electricity
      distribution companies in the U.K., higher U.S. income taxes and a potential
      unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates in 2006.

Statement
      of Income Analysis --

Domestic
      Gross Energy Margins

The
      following table provides pre-tax changes in the income statement line items
      that
      comprise domestic gross energy margins.

(a)

Adjusted
                to exclude the impact of any revenues and costs not associated with
                domestic gross energy margins, in particular, revenues and energy
                costs
                related to the international operations of PPL Global.

Also
                adjusted to include the margins of PPL's Sundance plant, which are
                included in "Loss from Discontinued Operations," and gains or losses
                on
                sales of emission allowances, which are included in "Other operation
                and
                maintenance" expenses, on the Statement of Income. Also, 2003 includes
                a
                reduction of the reserve for Enron
                receivables.

Changes
      in Domestic Gross Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
      gross energy margins are generated through PPL Energy Supply's normal hedging
      (non-trading) activities, as well as trading activities. PPL Energy Supply
      manages its non-trading energy business on a geographic basis that is aligned
      with its generation assets. In the second quarter of 2005, PPL Energy Supply
      also began participating in the Midwest ISO (MISO), an independent transmission
      system operator that serves the electric transmission needs of much of the
      Midwest. PPL Energy Supply records its business activities within MISO
      consistent with its accounting for activities in other RTOs.

Eastern
      U.S

.

Eastern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due
      to
      higher fuel costs. Average coal prices increased by 12% over last year, while
      average gas and oil prices increased by 24%. Despite record high generation
      in
      2005, the increased use of higher-cost oil and gas units to cover retail
      volumes, which were up 5% over 2004, and generation output lost during coal
      and
      nuclear plant outages contributed to lower margins. Due to market price
      increases and changes in fuel mix, average fuel prices increased 22% over 2004.
      Partially offsetting the effects of higher supply costs was a 2% increase in
      retail energy prices, in accordance with the schedule established by the PUC
      Final Order.

Eastern
      U.S. non-trading margins were higher in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily
      due
      to 3% higher generation, as well as higher prices and slightly higher sales
      volumes. In PJM, where the majority of PPL Energy Supply's Eastern wholesale
      activity occurs, average spot prices rose 15% in 2004 over 2003. PPL Energy
      Supply also benefited from favorable transmission congestion positions. In
      addition, retail energy prices increased by approximately 1% in 2004 in
      accordance with the schedule established by the PUC. The higher sales volumes
      reflect the return of customers who had previously shopped for electricity,
      as
      well as new load obligations in Connecticut and New Jersey, partially offset
      by
      lower wholesale sales. Partially offsetting these improvements were increased
      supply costs driven by increased fossil fuel and purchased power prices.

Southwestern
      U.S.

Southwestern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due
      to
      the sale of PPL Energy Supply's Sundance plant in May 2005 and the cost to
      terminate a tolling arrangement on the Griffith plant during the second quarter
      of 2005.

Southwestern
      U.S. non-trading margins were lower in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due
      to
      a 17% decrease in wholesale sales volumes. Also contributing to the decrease
      in
      margins was a $3 million positive impact to 2003 margins related to a partial
      reversal of a reserve against Enron receivables.

Net
      Energy Trading

PPL
      Energy Supply enters into certain energy contracts that meet the criteria of
      trading derivatives as defined by EITF Issue 02-3, "Issues Involved in
      Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
      Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." These physical
      and
      financial contracts cover trading activity associated with electricity, gas
      and
      oil.

Net
      energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2005 compared with 2004,
      primarily due to the inclusion of FTRs. As of July 1, 2005, FTRs were
      deemed to meet the definition of a derivative and were accounted for as such
      prospectively. Therefore, the forward and realized value for FTRs entered into
      for speculative purposes is accounted for as part of "Net energy trading
      margins" on the Statement of Income. From July 1 through December 31, 2005,
      gains on speculative FTRs totaled $10 million.

The
      $13
      million increase in net energy trading margins in 2004 compared with 2003 was
      due to a $6 million increase in electricity positions and a $6 million increase
      in gas and oil positions.

The
      physical volumes for electricity and gas associated with energy trading were
      5,800 GWh and 13.4 Bcf in 2005; 5,700 GWh and 11.7 Bcf in 2004; and 5,200 GWh
      and 12.6 Bcf in 2003. The amount of energy trading margins from unrealized
      mark-to-market transactions was a $5 million loss in 2005, a $13 million gain
      in
      2004 and not significant in 2003.

Utility
      Revenues

The
      increases in utility revenues were attributable to:

The
      increase in utility revenues for 2005 compared with 2004 was attributable
      to:

·

higher
                revenues in Chile, primarily due to a 7% increase in sales volumes,
                higher
                average prices overall and a favorable change in foreign currency
                exchange
                rates;

·

higher
                U.K. revenues, primarily due to favorable customer mix, an incentive
                revenue award for outstanding customer service and a favorable change
                in
                foreign currency exchange rates; and

·

higher
                revenues in El Salvador, primarily due to a 6% increase in sales
                volumes
                and higher average prices overall.

The
      increase in utility revenues for 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due
      to:

·

higher
                U.K. revenues, primarily due to a favorable change in foreign currency
                exchange rates; and

·

higher
                revenues in Chile, due to higher energy prices, which are a pass-through
                to customer rates, a favorable change in foreign currency exchange
                rates,
                and a 7% increase in sales volumes.

Energy-related
      Businesses

Energy-related
      businesses contributed $4 million more to operating income in 2005 compared
      with
      2004. The increase was attributable to:

·

a
                $15 million pre-tax loss in 2004, related to the sale of CGE (see
                Note 9
                to the Financial Statements); and

·

an
                aggregate increase of $4 million from various international subsidiary
                businesses; partially offset by

·

additional
                pre-tax losses in 2005 of $16 million on synfuel projects. This reflects
                $26 million of additional expenses due to higher production levels,
                offset
                by a $10 million net unrealized gain on options purchased to hedge
                a
                portion of the risk associated with the phase-out of the synthetic
                fuel
                tax credits for 2006 and 2007.

Energy-related
      businesses contributed $41 million less to operating income in 2004 compared
      with 2003. The decrease was attributable to:

Other
      Operation and Maintenance

The
      increases in other operation and maintenance expenses were due to:

The
      increase in net pension costs for both periods was primarily attributable to
      reductions in the discount rate assumption for PPL Energy Supply's domestic
      and
      international pension plans at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Increased WPD pension
      obligations as a result of the most recent actuarial valuation as of March
      31,
      2004, also served to increase the 2005 and ongoing net pension
      costs.

Although
      financial markets have improved and equity returns for PPL Energy Supply's
      domestic and international plans have been strong, interest rates on
      longer-duration, fixed-income obligations have continued to fall, requiring
      further reductions to the discount rates at December 31, 2005. In addition,
      PPL Energy Supply adopted the most current mortality tables and other
      demographic assumptions for its pension plans as of December 31, 2005. These
      assumptions are expected to increase PPL Energy Supply's pension costs for
      by approximately $17 million. See Note 12 to the Financial Statements for
      details on the funded status of PPL Energy Supply's pension plans.

Depreciation

Increases
      in depreciation expense were due to:

(a)

The
                lessor of this facility was consolidated under FIN 46, "Consolidation
                of
                Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," effective
                December 31, 2003. In June 2004, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply
                purchased the University Park generation facility from the lessor
                that was
                consolidated by PPL Energy Supply under FIN 46. See Note 22 to the
                Financial Statements for additional
                information.

Taxes,
      Other Than Income

Taxes,
      other than income, decreased by $1 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The
      decrease was primarily due to a $4 million decrease in domestic capital stock
      tax expense, partially offset by a $2 million increase in local real estate
      taxes.

Taxes,
      other than income, increased by $6 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The
      increase was primarily due to an $8 million increase in WPD's property taxes
      primarily from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
      adjustments recorded in 2003 and an increase in property tax rates.

Other
      Income - net

See
      Note
      16 to the Financial Statements for details of other income and
      deductions.

Financing
      Costs

The
      increases in interest expense, which includes "Interest Expense," "Interest
      Expense with Affiliates" and "Distributions on Preferred Securities," were
      due
      to:

(a)

Prior
                to commercial operation, interest related to the Lower Mt. Bethel
                financing was capitalized as part of the cost of the
                facility.

(b)

In
                June 2004, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply purchased the University
                Park
                generation facility from the lessor that was consolidated by PPL
                Energy
                Supply under FIN 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable
                Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." In connection
                with
                the purchase, the related financing was repaid and the deferred financing
                costs were written off. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for
                further information.

Income
      Taxes

Income
      tax expense decreased by $132 million in 2005 compared with 2004. This decrease
      was primarily attributable to:

Income
      tax expense increased by $13 million in 2004 compared with 2003. This increase
      was primarily attributable to:

Annual
      tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
      may
      result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities.
      However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by
      such
      authorities may differ materially from the amount accrued. In evaluating the
      exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL Energy Supply accounts
      for changes in probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the
      amount that should be recognized. An allowance is maintained for the tax
      contingencies, the balance of which management believes to be adequate. During
      2004, PPL Energy Supply reached partial settlement with the IRS with respect
      to
      the tax years 1991 through 1995 and received a cash refund in the amount of
      $7
      million. As a result of this settlement, the net tax impact recorded in 2004
      was
      not significant.

See
      Note
      5 to the Financial Statements for details on effective income tax rates and
      for
      information on the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Discontinued
      Operations

In
      2003,
      PPL Energy Supply reported a loss of $20 million in connection with the approval
      of a plan of sale of PPL Global's investment in a Latin American
      telecommunications company. In 2005, PPL Energy Supply recorded a $47 million
      loss, net of a tax benefit of $26 million, on the sale of its Sundance power
      plant.

See
      Note
      9 to the Financial Statements for information on the sales, along with
      information regarding operating losses recorded in 2003, 2004 and 2005 for
      the
      Sundance plant prior to the sale and for operating losses recorded in 2004
      related to the sale of PPL Global's investment in the Latin American
      telecommunications company.

Cumulative
      Effects of Changes in Accounting Principles

In
      2003,
      PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $27 million, after-tax, as a cumulative
      effect of a change in accounting principle in connection with the adoption
      of
      FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
      ARB
      No. 51," for certain entities. See Note 22 to the Financial Statements for
      additional information.

PPL
      Energy Supply adopted SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,"
      in 2003 and adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
      Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," in 2005. Both
      pronouncements address the accounting for obligations associated with the
      retirement of tangible long-lived assets. They require legal obligations
      associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
      liability in the financial statements. Application of the new rules resulted
      in
      cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles that increased net income
      by $63 million in 2003 and decreased net income by $8 million in 2005. See
      Note
      21 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Financial
      Condition

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

PPL
      Energy Supply is focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and
      strengthening its balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit
      profile. PPL Energy Supply believes that its cash on hand, short-term
      investments, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets
      and
      borrowing capacity, taken as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund
      its
      ongoing operating requirements, future security maturities and estimated future
      capital expenditures. PPL Energy Supply currently expects cash, cash equivalents
      and short-term investments at the end of 2006 to be approximately $300 million,
      while maintaining approximately $3.1 billion in credit facilities. However,
      PPL
      Energy Supply's cash flows from operations and its access to cost effective
      bank
      and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not
      limited to:

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply had $260 million of cash, cash equivalents
      and short-term investments and $180 million of short-term debt (including a
      note
      payable to an affiliate), compared with $408 million in cash, cash equivalents
      and short-term investments and no short-term debt at December 31, 2004, and
      $227 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $56
      million of short-term debt at December 31, 2003. The changes in PPL Energy
      Supply's cash and cash equivalents resulted from:

(a)

See
                Note 1 to the Financial Statements for an explanation of prior year
                reclassifications.

Operating
      Activities

Net
      cash
      from operating activities increased by 36%, or $222 million, in 2005 compared
      with 2004, primarily as a result of the posting of $300 million in cash
      collateral to PPL Electric in 2004 related to the PLR energy supply agreements
      and a decrease in income tax payments, partially offset by an increase of $95
      million in fuel expenditures due to increased prices and inventory build-up
      in
      anticipation of price increases in 2006. Net cash from operating activities
      decreased by 33%, or $303 million, in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting the
      posting of $300 million in cash collateral to PPL Electric related to the PLR
      energy supply agreements and higher cash taxes in 2004, partially offset by
      higher energy margins.

PPL
      Energy Supply expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating
      activities as a result of its long-term and intermediate-term power sales
      commitments from wholesale and retail customers and long-term purchase
      contracts. PPL Energy Supply estimates that, on average, approximately 84%
      of
      its expected annual generation output for the period 2006 through 2009 is
      committed under long-term and intermediate-term power sales contracts. PPL
      Energy Supply currently estimates that approximately 5% of its expected
      generation output for 2010 is committed under power sales contracts, due to
      the
      expiration of the PLR contracts at the end of 2009. Consistent with its business
      strategy, PPL Energy Supply expects that the capacity and energy currently
      committed to long-term power sales contracts will be contracted in the wholesale
      markets during the next few years. Based on the way in which the wholesale
      markets have developed to this point, new contracts may be of a shorter duration
      than the PLR supply contracts with PPL Electric, which at inception had terms
      of
      approximately nine years.

PPL
      Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel
      often require cash collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions or
      terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in
      the
      event of a downgrade of PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's credit ratings
      or adverse changes in market prices. For example, in addition to limiting its
      trading ability, if PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's ratings were lowered
      to below "investment grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL Energy
      Supply estimates that, based on its December 31, 2005 positions, it would have
      had to post additional collateral of approximately $611 million, compared with
      $280 million at December 31, 2004. PPL Energy Supply has in place risk
      management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to
      volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices, interest rates,
      foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operational
      performance of its generating units.

Investing
      Activities

Although
      net cash used in investing activities remained stable in 2005 compared with
      2004, there were significant changes in the components. PPL Energy Supply
      received $190 million in proceeds from the sale of the Sundance power plant
      in
      2005, compared to $123 million of proceeds from the sale of PPL Energy Supply's
      minority interest in CGE in 2004. For 2005 compared with 2004, there was an
      increase of $63 million in net proceeds from sales of auction rate securities,
      an increase of $72 million in capital expenditures and an increase of $63
      million in net purchases of emission allowances, in anticipation of future
      generation.

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities increased by $715 million in 2004 compared with
      2003. The primary reason for the increase was the repayment of a $653 note
      receivable from an affiliate in 2003, in addition to an increase of $41 million
      in net purchases of auction rate securities and an increase of $46 million
      in
      net purchases of emission allowances. The primary use of cash in investing
      activities is capital expenditures. See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail
      regarding capital expenditures in 2005 and projected expenditures for the years
      2006 through 2010.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in financing activities increased by $472 million in 2005 compared with
      2004, primarily as a result of the repayment in 2005 of a $495 million note
      that
      was issued to an affiliate in 2004 and a decrease of $308 million of
      contributions from Member, partially offset by an increase of $692 million
      in
      net proceeds from nonaffiliate debt and a decrease of $132 million in
      distributions to Member. Net cash from financing activities in 2004 increased
      by
      $1.1 billion compared with 2003. The primary reasons for this increase in cash
      from financing activities was due to a net reduction of $758 million in
      distributions to Member and a $495 million note issued to an affiliate. See
      "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Energy Supply's plans
      to
      issue debt securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity
      available to PPL Energy Supply. Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for
      information regarding maturities of PPL Energy Supply's long-term
      debt.

PPL
      Energy Supply's debt financing activity in 2005 was:

(a)

Includes
                a premium of approximately $13 million associated with the remarketing
                feature of the 5.70% REset Put Securities due 2035.

(b)

Repayment
                includes $30 million that was used to settle a related cross-currency
                swap.

Debt
      issued during 2005 had stated interest rates ranging from 2.9% to 9.0% and
      maturities from 2005 through 2035. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
      for more detailed information regarding PPL Energy Supply's financing
      activities.

Forecasted
      Sources of Cash

PPL
      Energy Supply expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
      in the near term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper
      program, operating leases and contributions from Member. PPL Energy Supply
      also
      expects to continue to have access to debt capital markets, as necessary, for
      its long-term financing needs.

Credit
      Facilities

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply's total committed borrowing capacity under
      credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
      addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
      agreements contain various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants beyond
      applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
      and/or termination of the agreements. PPL Energy Supply monitors the covenants
      on a regular basis. At December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply was in material
      compliance with those covenants. At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that
      these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these
      funding sources. PPL Energy Supply intends to renew and extend $2.3 billion
      of
      its credit facility capacity in 2006. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
      for
      further discussion of PPL Energy Supply's credit facilities.

Commercial
      Paper

PPL
      Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million to
      provide it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity
      needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by
      certain credit agreements of PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy Supply had $100
      million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005, and no commercial
      paper outstanding at December 31, 2004. During 2006, PPL Energy Supply may
      issue
      commercial paper from time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow
      needs.

Operating
      Leases

PPL
      Energy Supply and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that
      are
      provided through operating leases. PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries lease
      vehicles, office space, land, buildings, personal computers and other equipment.
      These leasing structures provide PPL Energy Supply with additional operating
      and
      financing flexibility. The operating leases contain covenants that are typical
      for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate
      existence and timely payment of rent and other fees. Failure to meet these
      covenants could limit or restrict access to these funds or require early payment
      of obligations. At this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants
      will not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or
      termination of the leases.

PPL
      Energy Supply, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in
      Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year,
      non-cancelable operating leases. These operating leases are not recorded on
      PPL
      Energy Supply's Balance Sheet, which is in accordance with applicable accounting
      guidance. The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to
      incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends. At this time, PPL
      Energy Supply believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these
      funding sources or cause acceleration or termination of the leases. See Note
      to the Financial Statements for a discussion of other dividend restrictions
      related to PPL Global subsidiaries.

See
      Note
      10 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
      leases.

Long-Term
      Debt Securities and Contributions from Member

Subject
      to market conditions in 2006, PPL Energy Supply currently plans to issue
      approximately $1.1 billion in long-term debt securities. PPL Energy Supply
      expects to use the proceeds primarily to fund capital expenditures, to fund
      maturities of existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

From
      time
      to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Energy Supply's Member,
      PPL Energy Funding, makes capital contributions to PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy
      Supply uses these contributions for general corporate purposes, including
      funding maturities of existing debt.

Forecasted
      Uses of Cash

In
      addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
      purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL Energy Supply currently expects
      to
      incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual
      obligations and distributions to Member.

Capital
      Expenditures

The
      table
      below shows PPL Energy Supply's actual spending for the year 2005 and current
      capital expenditure projections for the years 2006 through 2010.

(a)

Construction
                expenditures include capitalized interest, which is expected to be
                approximately $136 million for the 2006-2010 period.

(b)

This
                information excludes any potential investments by PPL Global for
                new
                projects.

PPL
      Energy Supply's capital expenditure projections for the years 2006-2010 total
      approximately $4.4 billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically
      to reflect changes in market and asset regulatory conditions. See Note 14 to
      the
      Financial Statements for additional information regarding the installation
      costs
      of sulfur dioxide scrubbers and other pollution control equipment, which
      comprise most of the "Environmental" expenditures noted above.

PPL
      Energy Supply plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2006 with cash
      on
      hand, cash from operations, and, when necessary, the issuance of debt
      securities.

Contractual
      Obligations

PPL
      Energy Supply has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in
      the
      ordinary course of conducting its business. At December 31, 2005, the estimated
      contractual cash obligations of PPL Energy Supply were:

(a)

Reflects
                principal maturities only, including maturities of consolidated lease
                debt. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
                conversion triggers related to PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible
                Senior Notes. Also, see Note 8 for a discussion of the remarketing
                feature
                related to PPL Energy Supply's 5.70% REset Put
                Securities.

(b)

The
                payments reflected herein are subject to change, as certain purchase
                obligations included are estimates based on projected obligated quantities
                and/or projected pricing under the contracts. Purchase orders made
                in the
                ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts presented.
                Includes obligations related to nuclear fuel and the installation
                of the
                scrubbers, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table
                presented above.

(c)

The
                amounts reflected represent estimated deficit pension funding requirements
                arising from an actuarial valuation performed in March 2004 and do
                not
                include pension funding requirements for future
                service.

Distributions
      to Member

From
      time
      to time, as determined by its Board of Managers, PPL Energy Supply makes return
      of capital distributions to its Member, which uses the distributions for general
      corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs.

Credit
      Ratings

Moody's,
      S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
      preferred securities of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries. Based on their
      respective reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings
      revisions.

A
      credit
      rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit worthiness
      associated with particular securities issued by PPL Energy Supply and its
      subsidiaries based on information provided by PPL Energy Supply and other
      sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to
      buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries.
      Such
      ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time
      and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that
      may be assigned to their securities. A downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or
      its
      subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced
      access to capital markets.

The
      following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its
      subsidiaries at December 31, 2005.

(a)

All
                Issuer Ratings for Fitch are "Issuer Default
                Ratings."

The
      rating agencies took the following actions on the debt and preferred securities
      of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries in 2005 and through February
      2006.

Moody's

In
      June
      2005, Moody's revised its outlooks to stable from negative on the senior
      unsecured debt and issuer ratings of WPDH Limited, the senior unsecured debt
      ratings of WPD LLP and the subordinated unsecured debt ratings of WPD LLP's
      unconsolidated subsidiary SIUK Capital Trust I. Moody's indicated that this
      positive change to the financial profiles resulted from a reduction in
      consolidated adjusted leverage at the WPD companies as a result of the
      redeployment to WPD of surplus cash from Latin American subsidiaries of PPL
      Energy Supply and from PPL Energy Supply's commitment to suspend its dividend
      from WPDH Limited in 2005. At the same time, Moody's affirmed the WPD companies'
      long-term and short-term credit rating. The outlook on the debt ratings of
      WPD
      (South Wales) and WPD (South West) was already stable.

S&P

In
      January 2005, S&P revised its outlooks on the WPD companies to stable from
      negative. S&P attributes this positive change to financial profile
      improvements resulting from the final regulatory outcome published by Ofgem
      in
      November 2004. At the same time, S&P affirmed the WPD companies' long-term
      and short-term credit ratings.

In
      October 2005, S&P affirmed its ratings of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Montana.
      The ratings affirmation is the result of S&P's annual review of PPL Energy
      Supply, including its business and financial risk profiles.

Fitch

In
      January 2005, Fitch announced that it downgraded the WPD companies' senior
      unsecured credit ratings by one notch:

·

WPDH
                Limited to BBB- from BBB;

·

WPD
                LLP to BBB from BBB+; and

·

WPD
                (South Wales) and WPD (South West) to BBB+/F2 from
                A-/F1.

Fitch
      stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension-adjusted
      leverage at WPD. Fitch acknowledged that WPD's funding plan should reduce its
      pension deficit over time, and it expects WPD to proceed with its de-leveraging
      program. However, Fitch indicated that it is not certain enough, due to the
      unpredictability in future pension valuations, that pension-adjusted leverage
      will support a BBB rating at WPDH Limited. Fitch indicated that WPD (South
      Wales) and WPD (South West) have been downgraded to maintain a two-notch
      differential with WPDH Limited because Fitch does not believe that WPD's
      financial ring-fencing is restrictive enough to support a three-notch
      differential.

In
      December 2005, Fitch affirmed PPL Montana's amortizing Pass-Through
      Certificates, the last of which are due 2020, at BBB. Fitch indicated that
      the
      rating reflects PPL Montana's credit quality on a stand-alone
      basis.

In
      December 2005, Fitch assigned issuer default ratings (IDRs) for its North
      American global power portfolio of issuers with ratings of BB- or higher. The
      IDR reflects Fitch's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its
      financial commitments on a timely basis, effectively becoming its benchmark
      probability of default. Fitch rates securities in an issuer's capital structure
      higher, lower or the same as the IDR based on Fitch's assessment of a particular
      security's relative recovery prospects. There were no changes in Fitch's
      securities ratings at PPL Energy Supply as a result of Fitch's assignment of
      an
      IDR.

In
      February 2006, Fitch's Europe, Middle East and Africa group implemented IDRs
      based on its new IDR methodology. This implementation led to Fitch's assignment
      of the following IDRs and Fitch's revision of its ratings on the following
      securities currently outstanding at WPD and its affiliates.

·

WPDH
                Limited IDR of BBB- and senior unsecured rating to BBB from
                BBB-;

·

WPD
                LLP IDR of BBB, senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB and preferred
                stock rating to BBB from BBB-; and

·

WPD
                (South Wales) and WPD (South West) IDR of BBB+ and senior unsecured
                debt
                rating to A- from BBB+.

Fitch's
      outlook for WPD and its affiliates remains stable.

Ratings
      Triggers

PPL
      Energy Supply's $400 million of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are
      convertible upon the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term
      credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB
      and Ba2, or either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes. The terms of
      the notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of
      the
      notes. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning
      the Convertible Senior Notes.

PPL
      Energy Supply and its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity
      exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would
      accelerate the due dates of borrowings. However, if PPL Energy Supply's debt
      ratings had been below investment grade at December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply
      and its subsidiaries would have had to post an additional $120 million of
      collateral to counterparties.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements

PPL
      Energy Supply provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing
      arrangements that enable certain transactions. Some of the guarantees contain
      financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the
      consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
      require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
      affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL Energy
      Supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant
      funding sources.

PPL
      Energy Supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within
      the
      scope of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
      Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
      Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB
      Interpretation No. 34." See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
      on guarantees.

Risk
      Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
      Risk

Background

Market
      risk is the potential loss PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of price
      changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument. PPL
      Energy Supply is exposed to market risk from:

PPL
      Energy Supply has a risk management policy approved by PPL's Board of Directors
      to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk. (Credit risk is discussed
      below.) The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Vice
      President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk
      control activities designed to monitor compliance with the risk policy and
      detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval,
      validation of transactions and market prices, verification of risk and
      transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily portfolio reporting, including
      open positions, mark-to-market valuations and other risk measurement
      metrics.

The
      forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may
      occur
      in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance
      on
      model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those
      presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future
      losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses.

Contract
      Valuation

PPL
      Energy Supply utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
      and
      tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize
      unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price, interest
      rate
      and foreign currency volatility.

When
      available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a
      commodity or financial instrument. This may include exchange prices, the average
      mid-point bid/ask spreads obtained from brokers, or an independent valuation
      by
      an external source, such as a bank. However, market prices for energy or
      energy-related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market
      illiquidity. If no active trading market exists, contracts are valued using
      internally developed models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal
      group. Although PPL Energy Supply believes that its valuation methods are
      reasonable, changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly
      different values and realization in future periods.

To
      record
      energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL Energy Supply discounts the forward
      values using the U.S. Utility BBB+ Curve. Additionally, PPL Energy Supply
      adjusts derivative carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty
      credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market:

Accounting
      and Reporting

To
      account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
      Energy Supply follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS 138, "Accounting for
      Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," and SFAS 149,
      "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
      and interpreted by DIG issues (together, "SFAS 133"), EITF 02-3, "Issues
      Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and
      Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," and EITF
      03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That
      Are
      Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined
      in Issue No. 02-3." SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
      recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability (unless
      they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion) and that changes in the
      derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
      hedge accounting criteria are met.

In
      April
      2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which amends and clarifies SFAS 133 to improve
      financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging
      activities. To ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are
      accounted for similarly, SFAS 149 clarified the circumstances under which a
      contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a
      derivative, clarified when a derivative contains a financing component, amended
      the definition of an "underlying" and amended certain other existing
      pronouncements.

Additionally,
      SFAS 149 placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or
      normal sale exception. SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or
      modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except
      certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when-issued
      securities or other securities that did not yet exist.

PPL
      Energy Supply adopted SFAS 149 as of July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149
      did
      not have a significant impact on PPL Energy Supply.

In
      accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and
      unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for
      trading purposes in the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statement
      of
      Income. Non-derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading
      activities as defined by EITF 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in
      Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" are reflected in the financial
      statements using the accrual method of accounting. Under the accrual method
      of
      accounting, unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial
      statements.

PPL
      Energy Supply adopted the final provisions of EITF 03-11 prospectively as of
      October 1, 2003. As a result of this adoption, non-trading bilateral sales
      of
      electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that
      offset the sales at those same delivery points. A major market delivery point
      is
      any delivery point with liquid pricing available. See Note 17 to the Financial
      Statements for the impact of the adoption of EITF 03-11.

PPL
      Energy Supply's short-term derivative contracts are recorded as "Price risk
      management assets" and "Price risk management liabilities" on the Balance Sheet.
      Long-term derivative contracts are included in "Other Noncurrent Assets - Other"
      and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other."

Accounting
      Designation

Energy
      contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
      treatment. For energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the
      circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are
      entered into determine their accounting designation. In addition to
      energy-related transactions, PPL Energy Supply enters into financial interest
      rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated
      with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL Energy Supply also enters
      into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments
      denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations.
      As
      with energy transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time
      of
      the transaction determine the contract's accounting designation. These
      designations are verified by a separate internal group on a daily basis. See
      Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a summary of the guidelines that have
      been provided to the traders who are responsible for the designation of
      derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
      Price Risk (Non-Trading)

Commodity
      price risk is one of PPL Energy Supply's most significant risks due to the
      level
      of investment that PPL Energy Supply maintains in its generation assets, coupled
      with the volatility of prices for energy and energy-related products. Several
      factors influence price levels and volatilities. These factors include, but
      are
      not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available
      generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability
      within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of
      current and potential federal and state regulations. To hedge the impact of
      market price fluctuations on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related assets,
      liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
      purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs
      throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
      over-the-counter contracts. Because PPL Energy Supply owns or controls
      generating assets, the majority of PPL Energy Supply's energy transactions
      qualify for accrual or hedge accounting. Additionally, the non-trading portfolio
      includes the fair value of options that are economic hedges of PPL Energy
      Supply's synthetic fuel tax credits. Although they do not receive hedge
      accounting treatment, these options are considered non-trading.

Within
      PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy
      contracts hinges on the expected value of PPL Energy Supply's generation. To
      address this risk, PPL Energy Supply takes a conservative approach in
      determining the number of MWhs that are available to be sold forward. In this
      regard, PPL Energy Supply reduces the maximum potential output that a plant
      may
      produce by three factors - planned maintenance, unplanned outages and economic
      conditions. The potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount
      of
      unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit. Another
      reduction, representing the unplanned outage rate, is the amount of MWhs that
      historically are not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment
      breakage. Finally, the potential output of certain plants (such as peaking
      units) is reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them
      to
      economically run during all hours.

PPL
      Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy
      contracts. The net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute.
      PPL Energy Supply analyzes historical on-peak and off-peak usage patterns,
      as
      well as spot prices and weather patterns, to determine a monthly level of a
      block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize
      earnings volatility. On a forward basis, PPL Energy Supply reserves a block
      amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected
      to
      be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks.
      Anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are affected by expected load
      changes, regional economic drivers and seasonality.

PPL
      Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various
      times through 2010. The following chart sets forth PPL Energy Supply's net
      fair
      market value of these contracts as of December 31.

The
      following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL Energy Supply's
      non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2005, based on
      whether the fair values are determined by quoted market prices or other more
      subjective means.

The
      "Prices actively quoted" category includes the fair value of exchange-traded
      natural gas futures contracts quoted on the NYMEX, which has currently quoted
      prices through 2011.

The
      "Prices provided by other external sources" category includes PPL Energy
      Supply's forward positions and options in natural gas and power and natural
      gas
      basis swaps at points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker quotes are
      available. The fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the
      midpoint of the bid/ask spreads obtained through OTC brokers. On average, OTC
      quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years
      into the future.

The
      "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the
      value
      of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed
      as
      a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of
      the
      market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC
      broker.

Because
      of PPL Energy Supply's efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its
      generation assets, PPL Energy Supply sells electricity and buys fuel on a
      forward basis, resulting in open contractual positions. If PPL Energy Supply
      were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of
      fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required
      to
      pay damages. These damages would be based on the difference between the market
      price and the contract price of the commodity. Depending on price volatility
      in
      the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. Extreme weather
      conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions,
      non-performance by counterparties (or their own counterparties) with which
      it
      has energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL Energy Supply's ability
      to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price
      of
      replacement energy. Although PPL Energy Supply attempts to mitigate these risks,
      there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm
      obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform,
      or that it will not experience counterparty non-performance in the future.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
      in
      market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
      the value of the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by
      approximately $275 million, compared with a decrease of $165 million at December
      31, 2004. For purposes of this calculation, an increase in the market price
      for
      electricity is considered an adverse movement because PPL Energy Supply's
      electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position, and a decrease
      in
      the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement because PPL Energy
      Supply's commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position.
      PPL
      Energy Supply enters into those commodity contracts to reduce the market risk
      inherent in the generation of electricity.

In
      accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL Energy Supply does not completely
      hedge its generation output or fuel requirements. PPL Energy Supply estimates
      that for its entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical
      and financial energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across
      all
      geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected 2006 gross margins
      by
      $18 million. Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices would
      decrease 2006 gross margins by $10 million.

Commodity
      Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
      Energy Supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
      opportunities. As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a net open
      position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices
      do
      not move in the manner or direction anticipated. The margins from these trading
      activities are shown in the Statement of Income as "Net energy trading
      margins."

PPL
      Energy Supply's trading contracts mature at various times through 2009. The
      following chart sets forth PPL Energy Supply's net fair market value of trading
      contracts as of December 31.

PPL
      Energy Supply will reverse approximately $1 million of the $5 million unrealized
      trading gains over the first three months of 2006 as the transactions are
      realized.

The
      following chart segregates estimated fair values of PPL Energy Supply's trading
      portfolio at December 31, 2005, based on whether the fair values are determined
      by quoted market prices or other more subjective means.

See
      "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)" for information on the various sources
      of
      fair value.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
      in
      market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
      the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $23 million,
      compared with a decrease of $5 million at December 31, 2004.

Interest
      Rate Risk

PPL
      Energy Supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations.
      PPL manages interest rate risk for PPL Energy Supply by using various financial
      derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates
      in
      its debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in U.S.
      Treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation
      of
      future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management
      program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense
      and changes in the fair value of PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio due to
      changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply's potential annual exposure to increased
      interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was estimated
      at $2
      million, compared with $1 million at December 31, 2004.

PPL
      Energy Supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic
      and
      international debt portfolios. At December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply
      estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its
      debt
      portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was approximately
      $151 million, compared with $156 million at December 31, 2004.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce PPL
      Energy Supply's exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its
      debt instruments. These risks include exposure to adverse interest rate
      movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated
      financing. While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value
      of
      these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these instruments are
      recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the same period during
      which the item being hedged affects earnings. At December 31, 2005, the market
      value of these instruments, representing the amount PPL Energy Supply would
      receive upon their termination, was approximately $2 million. At December 31,
      2005, PPL Energy Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in
      the
      fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in the hedged
      exposure, was $2 million. At December 31, 2004, PPL Energy Supply had none
      of
      these instruments outstanding.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust
      the
      mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio.
      While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these
      instruments, any change in market value is recorded with an equal and offsetting
      change in the value of the debt being hedged. At December 31, 2005, PPL Energy
      Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value
      of
      these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was
      approximately $2 million, compared with an exposure of $2 million at December
      31, 2004.

Foreign
      Currency Risk

PPL
      Energy Supply is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments
      in affiliates in the U.K. and Latin America. In addition, PPL Energy Supply
      may
      make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL
      has
      adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain
      foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or
      liabilities and net investments. In addition, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter
      into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation
      risk.

To
      protect expected income in Chilean pesos, PPL entered into an average rate
      forward for 8 billion Chilean pesos. The settlement date of this forward is
      November 2006. At December 31, 2005, the market value of this position,
      representing the amount PPL would pay upon its termination, was insignificant.
      PPL Energy Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the
      market value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign
      exchange rates, was insignificant at December 31, 2005.

WPDH
      Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $1.1 billion
      to
      hedge the interest payments and value of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds
      with
      maturity dates ranging from December 2006 to December 2028. The estimated value
      of this position at December 31, 2005, being the amount PPL would pay to
      terminate it, including accrued interest, was approximately $164
      million.

PPL
      Energy Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market
      value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange
      rates, was $140 million at December 31, 2005.

On
      the
      Statement of Income, gains and losses associated with hedges of interest
      payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in "Interest Expense."
      Gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in
      "Depreciation." Gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of "Member's Equity" on the
      Balance Sheet, until the investment is disposed.

Nuclear
      Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
      connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
      to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna station. As of
      December 31, 2005, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity
      securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair
      value on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheet. The mix of securities is designed
      to
      provide returns to be used to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to
      compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. However, the
      equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in
      equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are
      exposed to changes in interest rates. PPL Susquehanna actively monitors the
      investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance
      with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement. At December 31,
      2005, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity
      prices would have resulted in an estimated $33 million reduction in the fair
      value of the trust assets, compared with a $30 million reduction at December
      31,
      2004. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
      the
      nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Synthetic
      Fuel Tax Credit Risk

Recent
      increases in and the volatility of crude oil prices threaten to reduce the
      amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that PPL Energy Supply expects to receive
      through its synthetic fuel production. The tax credits are reduced if the annual
      average wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase-out range.
      The
      tax credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds the phase-out range.
      See "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax Credits" in Note 14 to the
      Financial Statements for more information regarding the phase-out of the tax
      credits.

PPL
      Energy Supply implemented a risk management objective to hedge a portion of
      the
      variability of cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel
      tax
      credits by hedging the risk that the 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead
      price
      for domestic crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

PPL
      Energy Supply purchased options in 2005 to mitigate some of the reductions
      in
      synthetic fuel tax credits if the annual average wellhead price for 2006 and
      2007 falls within the applicable phase-out range. These positions did not
      qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The mark-to-market value of these
      positions as of December 31, 2005, was a gain of $10 million, and is reflected
      in "Energy-related businesses" revenues on the Statement of Income.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement
      in
      market prices of crude oil would have decreased the value of the synthetic
      fuel
      hedges by $24 million. For purposes of this calculation, a decrease in the
      market price for crude oil is considered an adverse movement.

Credit
      Risk

Credit
      risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL Energy Supply would incur as a result
      of non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. PPL
      Energy Supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to
      counterparties (including requirements that counterparties maintain certain
      credit ratings criteria) and requires other assurances in the form of credit
      support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty
      credit risk. However, PPL Energy Supply has concentrations of suppliers and
      customers among electric utilities, natural gas distribution companies and
      other
      energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations of counterparties
      may impact PPL Energy Supply's overall exposure to credit risk, either
      positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected
      by
      changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. As discussed above in
      "Contract Valuation," PPL Energy Supply records certain non-performance reserves
      to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out
      of
      the money (from the counterparty's standpoint) will default in its performance.
      In this case, PPL Energy Supply would have to sell into a lower-priced market
      or
      purchase from a higher-priced market. These reserves are reflected in the fair
      value of assets recorded in "Price risk management assets" on the Balance Sheet.
      PPL Energy Supply also records reserves to reflect the probability that a
      counterparty will not make payments for deliveries PPL Energy Supply has made
      but not yet billed. These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on
      the
      Balance Sheet. PPL Energy Supply also has established a reserve with respect
      to
      certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL Energy Supply has not yet
      been
      paid, as well as a reserve related to PPL Energy Supply's exposure as a result
      of the Enron bankruptcy, which are reflected in "Accounts receivable" on the
      Balance Sheet. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Financial Statements.

Application
      of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL
      Energy Supply's financial condition and results of operations are impacted
      by
      the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
      accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly
      important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL Energy
      Supply, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
      uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these
      accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information
      presented in the financial statements. (These accounting policies are also
      discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.) PPL's senior management has
      reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions
      regarding them, with its Audit Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management
      has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these
      critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee.

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefits

As
      described in Note 12 to the Financial Statements, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries
      sponsor various pension and other postretirement plans and participate in,
      and
      are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension
      cost of the PPL Retirement Plan and the PPL Postretirement Benefit Plan. PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply follow the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for
      Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
      Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these pension and other postretirement
      benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding
      the
      valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Delayed
      recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated
      results is a guiding principle of these standards. This delayed recognition
      of
      actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit
      obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who
      benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are:

In
      selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement
      plans, PPL Energy Supply starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment
      stream for its plans. This information is first matched against a spot-rate
      yield curve. A portfolio of nearly 600 Moody's Aa-graded non-callable corporate
      bonds, with a total outstanding float in excess of $300 billion, serves as
      the
      base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to
      develop the ultimate yield curve. The results of this analysis are considered
      in
      conjunction with other economic data and consideration of movements in the
      Moody's Aa bond index to determine the discount rate assumption. At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply decreased the discount rate for its
      domestic plans from 5.75% to 5.70% as a result of this assessment.

The
      selection of a discount rate for the international pension plans of WPD again
      starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment streams. This
      information is analyzed against yields on long-term high-quality corporate
      bonds
      within the iBoxx index. Due to the flatness of U.K. yield curves, the
      duration-weighted discount rate is approximately the same. At December 31,
      2005,
      PPL Energy Supply decreased the discount rate for its international pension
      plans from 5.50% to 4.75% as a result of this assessment.

In
      selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL and PPL Energy Supply consider
      tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of
      investments held by the plans. At December 31, 2005, PPL's and PPL Energy
      Supply's expected return on plan assets was decreased from 8.75% to 8.50% for
      their domestic pension plans. For its international plans, PPL Energy Supply's
      expected return on plan assets was reduced from 8.30% to 8.09% at December
      31,
      2005. Both PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's domestic and international pension
      plans have significantly exceeded the expected return on plan assets for 2004
      and 2005. However, the expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased
      to reflect a long-term view of equity markets and an expected increase in
      long-term bond yields.

In
      selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL and PPL Energy Supply consider
      past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2005,
      PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase was changed to
      4.75%
      from 4.00% for their domestic plans. For the international plans, the rate
      of
      compensation increase remained at 3.75% at December 31, 2005.

In
      selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL and PPL Energy Supply consider
      past
      performance and forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2005, the
      health care cost trend rates were 10.0% for 2006, gradually declining to 5.5%
      for 2011.

A
      variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
      projected benefit obligations, accrued pension and other postretirement benefit
      liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement
      benefit cost and other comprehensive income (OCI). The following chart reflects
      the sensitivities in the 2005 financial statements associated with a change
      in
      certain assumptions. While the chart below reflects either an increase or
      decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the
      projected benefit obligation, accrued pension and other postretirement benefit
      liabilities, reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement
      benefit cost and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite direction. Each
      sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change
      in that assumption.

(a)

Excludes
                the impact of additional minimum liability.

(b)

Only
                impacts other postretirement
                benefits.

The
      total
      net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation for PPL Energy Supply's
      plans was $373 million as of December 31, 2005. PPL Energy Supply recognized
      an
      aggregate net accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liability of
      $228
      million on its Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005, for its plans. The
      total obligation is not fully reflected in the current financial statements
      due
      to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these
      obligations. At December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply also reflected a net
      liability of $59 million on its Balance Sheet for pension liabilities and
      prepaid other postretirement benefit costs allocated from plans sponsored by
      PPL
      Services.

In
      2005,
      PPL Energy Supply was allocated and recognized net periodic pension and other
      postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of $25 million. This amount
      represents a $43 million increase compared with the credit recognized during
      2004. This increase in expense was primarily attributable to PPL's international
      plans and was the result of the decrease in the discount rate at December 31,
      2004, and recognition of prior losses.

The
      pension plans of WPD have accumulated deferred losses of $721 million as of
      December 31, 2005, as a result of changes in the discount rate assumption,
      expected compared with actual asset returns and changes in demographic
      assumptions and experience.  The losses, to the extent not offset by future
      gains, will be amortized in accordance with PPL Energy Supply's policy regarding
      recognition of gains and losses as detailed in Note 1 to the Financial
      Statements.

Strong
      asset returns and falling foreign currency conversion rates offset the impact
      of
      the decrease in the discount rate, allowing PPL Energy Supply to reduce its
      additional minimum pension liability for its international pension plans, offset
      by a modest increase for it's domestic pension plans. Recording the change
      in
      the additional minimum liability resulted in a $21 million decrease to the
      pension-related charge to OCI, net of taxes, translation adjustment and
      unrecognized prior service costs, with no effect on net income. The
      pension-related balance in OCI, which is a reduction to shareowners' equity,
      was
      reduced from $360 million at December 31, 2004, to $339 million at December
      31,
      2005. The charges to OCI will reverse in future periods if the fair value of
      trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation.

      to
      Note 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding pension
      and other postretirement benefits.

Asset
      Impairment

PPL
      Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including
      intangibles, that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance
      with
      SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."
      PPL
      Energy Supply tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
      indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable.
      Examples of such events or changes in circumstances are:

For
      a
      long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the
      sum
      of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
      eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment
      loss
      is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value.

In
      determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
      estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
      value of the assets and management's intent to use the assets. Changes in
      assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result
      in
      significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the
      financial statements. For determining fair value, the FASB has indicated that
      quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value.
      However, when market prices are unavailable, other valuation techniques may
      be
      used. PPL Energy Supply has generally used a present value technique (i.e.,
      discounted cash flow). Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future
      cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the
      present value of the cash flow streams.

PPL
      Energy Supply has determined that, when alternative courses of action to recover
      the carrying value of a long-lived asset are being considered, it uses estimated
      cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one
      scenario is clearly the most likely outcome. If no scenario is clearly most
      likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration
      estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios. For assets tested for
      impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows
      used
      in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the
      balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the future
      sale of the assets. That assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not
      revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.

During
      2005, PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas-fired
      generation assets for impairment, as events and circumstances indicated that
      the
      carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. PPL Energy Supply did
      not
      record an impairment of these gas-fired generation assets in 2005. For these
      impairment analyses, the most significant assumption was the estimate of future
      cash flows. PPL Energy Supply estimates future cash flows using information
      from
      its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sale or purchase
      commitments. Key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for
      electricity and gas as well as firm sale and purchase commitments. A 10%
      decrease in estimated future cash flows for the gas-fired generation assets
      would not have resulted in an impairment charge.

PPL
      Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with
      SFAS
      142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." PPL Energy Supply performs an
      annual impairment test for goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes
      in
      circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

SFAS
      requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
      PPL
      Energy Supply has determined its reporting units to be one level below its
      operating segments.

Goodwill
      is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the
      goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
      with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of
      a
      reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is
      considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value
      of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of
      impairment loss, if any.

The
      second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. The
      implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
      of
      goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a
      reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit
      as
      if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the
      estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the
      reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
      over
      the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value
      of
      goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared
      with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the
      implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
      that
      excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting
      unit's goodwill.

PPL
      Energy Supply completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth
      quarter of 2005. This test did not require any second-step assessments and
      did
      not result in any impairments. PPL Energy Supply's most significant assumptions
      surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting
      unit fair values. PPL Energy Supply estimated fair values primarily based upon
      discounted cash flows. Although a full two-step evaluation was not completed,
      a
      decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10% or an increase of the discount
      rates by 50 basis points would have resulted in the carrying value of certain
      reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values, indicating a potential
      impairment of goodwill.

Leasing

PPL
      Energy Supply applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," to
      all
      leasing transactions. In addition, PPL Energy Supply applies the provisions
      of
      numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the EITF that
      provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting
      for
      various leasing arrangements. In general, there are two types of leases from
      a
      lessee's perspective: operating leases - leases accounted for off-balance sheet;
      and capital leases - leases capitalized on the balance sheet.

In
      accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
      discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
      useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating
      or
      capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
      whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease,
      thus
      significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
      statements.

In
      addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
      transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
      they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
      accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
      assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment
      for
      book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
      and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply continued to participate in a significant
      sale/leaseback transaction. In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in
      the
      Colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back
      to
      PPL Montana under four 36-year operating leases. This transaction is accounted
      for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to
      sale/leaseback arrangements. If for any reason this transaction did not meet
      the
      requirements for off-balance sheet operating lease treatment as a
      sale/leaseback, PPL Energy Supply would have recorded approximately $270 million
      of additional assets and approximately $318 million of additional liabilities
      on
      its balance sheet at December 31, 2005, and would have recorded additional
      expenses currently estimated at $7 million, after-tax, in 2005.

See
      Note
      10 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
      leases.

5)

Loss
      Accruals

PPL
      Energy Supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
      conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. These
      events are called "contingencies," and PPL Energy Supply's accounting for such
      events is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and other
      related accounting guidance. SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing
      condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to
      possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when
      one
      or more future events occur or fail to occur."

For
      loss
      contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
      indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
      of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
      estimated. FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events
      are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies that
      might result in gains. PPL Energy Supply continuously assesses potential loss
      contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income taxes,
      regulatory penalties and other events.

PPL
      Energy Supply also has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase
      commitments when significant events have occurred. For example, estimated losses
      were accrued when long-term purchase commitments were assumed under asset
      acquisition agreements and

when
      PPL
      Electric's generation business was deregulated. Under regulatory accounting,
      PPL
      Electric recorded the above-market cost of energy purchases from NUGs as part
      of
      its purchased power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs were
      recovered in regulated rates. When the generation business was deregulated,
      the
      estimated loss associated with these long-term purchase commitments to make
      above-market NUG purchases was recorded because PPL Electric was committed
      to
      purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover
      these
      costs in regulated rates. As described below, this loss accrual was transferred
      to PPL EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000 corporate realignment.

The
      accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
      identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
      events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
      as
      to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
      of
      accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL Energy Supply's
      management.

Initial
      Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
      Energy Supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers,
      tax specialists and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability
      that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In
      2005,
      a loss accrual was recorded for the remediation expenses in connection with
      the
      ash basin leak at the Martins Creek generating station. Significant judgment
      was
      required by PPL Energy Supply's management to perform the initial assessment
      of
      this contingency. In August 2005, a leak from a disposal basin containing fly
      ash and water at the Martins Creek generating station caused a discharge from
      the basin onto adjacent roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the
      Delaware River. PPL Energy Supply immediately began to work with the
      Pennsylvania DEP and appropriate agencies and consultants to assess the extent
      of environmental damage caused by the discharge and to remediate the damage.
      At
      that time, PPL Energy Supply had, and still has, no reason to believe that
      the
      Martins Creek leak has caused any danger to human health or any adverse
      biological impact on the river aquatic life. However, at that time, PPL Energy
      Supply expected that it would be subject to an enforcement action by the
      Pennsylvania DEP and that claims may be brought against it by several state
      agencies and private litigants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for
      additional information.

PPL
      Energy Supply's management assessed the contingency in the third quarter of
      2005. The ultimate cost of the remediation effort was difficult to estimate
      due
      to a number of uncertainties, such as the scope of the project, the impact
      of
      weather conditions on the ash recovery effort, and the ultimate outcome of
      enforcement actions and private litigation. PPL Energy Supply's management
      concluded, at the time, that $33 million was the best estimate of the cost
      of
      the remediation effort. PPL Energy Supply recorded this loss accrual in the
      third quarter of 2005.

See
      "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a discussion of the year-end
      2005 assessment of this contingency.

PPL
      Energy Supply has identified certain other events that could give rise to a
      loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS 5
      requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is
      "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred. The FASB defines
      "reasonably possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or
      events occurring is more than remote but less than likely." See Note 14 to
      the
      Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that
      have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS 5.

Reducing
      Recorded Loss Accruals

When
      an
      estimated loss is accrued, PPL Energy Supply identifies, where applicable,
      the
      triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering
      events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
      loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.
      The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
      of certain recorded loss accruals:

The
      largest loss accrual on PPL Energy Supply 's balance sheet, and the loss accrual
      that changed most significantly in 2005, was for an impairment of above-market
      NUG purchase commitments. This loss accrual reflects the estimated difference
      between the above-market contract terms, under the purchase commitments, and
      the
      fair value of the electricity to be purchased. This loss accrual was originally
      recorded at $854 million in 1998, when PPL Electric's generation business was
      deregulated.

When
      the
      loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
      established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced.
      A
      schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases
      over the lives of the NUG contracts. This loss accrual was transferred to PPL
      EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000 corporate realignment. PPL EnergyPlus continues
      to reduce the above-market NUG liability based on the aforementioned schedule.
      As PPL EnergyPlus reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases,
      it
      offsets the actual cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power
      purchase expense more in line with expected market prices. The above-market
      loss
      accrual was $206 million at December 31, 2005. This loss accrual will be
      significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts expires.
      The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in 2014.

Ongoing
      Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
      Energy Supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
      recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing
      communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
      tax specialists, operation management and other parties.

Significant
      management judgment is required in developing PPL Energy Supply

's
      contingencies, or reserves, for income taxes and valuation allowances for
      deferred tax assets. The ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended
      to
      result in management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for
      each tax year. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient
      to
      pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns
      by
      taxing authorities. However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of
      any
      issues raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In
      evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL Energy
      Supply accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management's best
      estimate of the amount that should be recognized. An allowance is maintained
      for
      the tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes to be adequate.
      The ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment of
      whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized. Management considers
      a
      number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets,
      including forecasts of taxable income in future periods.

As
      part
      of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL Energy Supply's
      management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the ash basin leak at Martins
      Creek, described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
      Accrual." Based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications with
      the
      Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies, PPL Energy Supply's management
      concluded that $48 million was currently the best estimate of the cost of the
      remediation effort. Therefore, PPL Energy Supply revised the loss accrual in
      the
      fourth quarter of 2005. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional
      information. PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the final cost of assessment
      and
      remediation of the leak, the outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania
      DEP or the action initiated by the Delaware Riverside Conservancy and several
      citizens, the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, the exact
      nature of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated
      against PPL Energy Supply as a result of the disposal basin leak, the extent
      of
      the fines or damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions
      or
      the ultimate financial impact on PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy Supply's
      management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in
      future periods.

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

SFAS
      143,
      "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
      associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
      liability in the financial statements. The initial obligation should be measured
      at the estimated fair value. An equivalent amount should be recorded as an
      increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over
      the
      useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability should
      be increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income
      statement, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of
      time.

FIN
      47,
      "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation
      of
      FASB Statement No. 143," which was issued in March 2005, and adopted by PPL
      effective December 31, 2005, clarified the term conditional ARO as used in
      SFAS
      143. FIN 47 specified that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred
      if
      the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. See Note 21 for further
      discussion of the impact of FIN 47 on PPL Energy Supply.

In
      determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates
      to
      calculate fair value. Fair value is developed through consideration of estimated
      retirement costs in today's dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement
      date
      and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in
      assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value
      of
      AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified
      and
      recorded in the financial statements.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply had AROs totaling $298 million recorded
      on
      the Balance Sheet. PPL Energy Supply's most significant assumptions surrounding
      AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation
      rates. A variance in the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or
      the
      inflation rates could have a significant impact on the ARO
      liabilities.

The
      following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the ARO liabilities as
      of
      December 31, 2005, associated with a change in these assumptions at the time
      of
      initial recognition. There is no significant change to the ARO asset values,
      depreciation expense of the ARO assets or accretion expense of the ARO
      liabilities as a result of changing the assumptions. Each sensitivity below
      reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
      assumption.

ITEM
      7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
      OF
      OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
      Electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central
      Pennsylvania. Its headquarters are in Allentown, PA. See "Item 1. Business
      -
      Background," for a description of PPL Electric's business. PPL Electric's
      strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery
      business at the highest level of customer service and reliability and at the
      most efficient cost.

PPL
      Electric's electricity delivery business is rate-regulated. Accordingly, PPL
      Electric is subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that it may
      recover and the investment returns that it may collect in customer
      rates.

A
      key
      challenge for PPL Electric is to maintain a strong credit profile. Investors,
      analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry
      continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these
      companies. PPL Electric continually focuses on strengthening its balance sheet
      and improving its liquidity position, thereby improving its credit
      profile.

See
      "Item
      1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning material risks PPL Electric
      faces in its business.

The
      purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Electric's
      past
      and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and challenges
      mentioned above. Specifically:

The
      information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL

      Item 7 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the risks,
      uncertainties and factors that may impact PPL Electric's future
      earnings.

      Outlook

PPL
      Electric is projecting flat delivery revenues due to projected modest load
      growth in 2006 compared with 2005 and because of higher sales in 2005 as a
      result of unusually warm weather. PPL Electric is also expecting to experience
      increased operation and maintenance expenses in 2006.

Operating
      Revenues

Retail
      Electric

The
      increases in revenues from retail electric operations were attributable
      to:

The
      increase in revenues from retail electric operations for 2005 compared with
      was primarily due to:

·

higher
                PLR revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates and a 6% increase
                in
                volume, in part due to the return of customers previously served
                by
                alternate suppliers; and

·

higher
                electric delivery revenues resulting from higher transmission and
                distribution customer rates effective January 1, 2005, and a 4.3%
                increase in volume.

The
      increase in revenues from retail electric operations for 2004 compared with
      was primarily due to:

·

higher
                PLR revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates and a 3.6% increase
                in volume, in part due to the return of customers previously served
                by
                alternate suppliers; partially offset by

·

lower
                electric delivery revenues due to a decrease in ITC and CTC revenue
                as a
                result of lower ITC rates, and several rate groups reaching their
                cap;
                and

·

lower
                sales to PPL Generation. PPL Generation's power plants began
                self-supplying their station use in April 2003, rather than taking
                supply
                from PPL Electric.

Wholesale
      Electric

PPL
      Electric wholesale revenues were previously derived primarily from sales to
      municipalities. The $23 million decrease in wholesale electric revenues in
      compared with 2003 was due to the expiration of all municipal purchase power
      agreements at the end of January 2004.

Wholesale
      Electric to Affiliate

PPL
      Electric has a contract to sell to PPL EnergyPlus the electricity that PPL
      Electric purchases under contracts with NUGs. The $6 million decrease in
      wholesale revenue to affiliate in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due
      to
      an unplanned outage at a NUG facility during the second quarter of

2005.
      PPL
      Electric therefore had less electricity to sell to PPL EnergyPlus.

Energy
      Purchases

Energy
      purchases increased by $47 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due
      to
      the $39 million accrual for the PJM billing dispute. See Note 14 to the
      Financial Statements for additional information regarding the loss accrual
      recorded for the PJM billing dispute. Also, the increase reflects a $10 million
      charge to load-serving entities which began in May 2005, retroactive to December
      2004. This charge minimizes the revenue impacts to transmission owners that
      result from the integration of the Midwest ISO and PJM markets and will continue
      until March 2006. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease
      due to an unplanned NUG outage in the second quarter of 2005.

Energy
      Purchases from Affiliate

Energy
      purchases from affiliate increased by $90 million in 2005 compared with 2004
      and
      by $56 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increases reflect an increase
      in
      PLR load, as well as higher prices for energy purchased under the power supply
      contracts with PPL EnergyPlus that was needed to support the PLR
      load.

Other
      Operation and Maintenance

The
      increases in other operation and maintenance expenses were due to:

Depreciation

Depreciation
      increased by $5 million in 2005 compared with 2004 and by $4 million in 2004
      compared with 2003 due to plant additions, including the Automated Meter Reading
      project.

Taxes,
      Other Than Income

In
      2004,
      PPL Electric reversed a $14 million accrued liability for 1998 and 1999 PURTA
      taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings
      regarding the Susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment. The rights of
      third-party intervenors to further appeal expired in 2004. The reversal and
      a
      $19 million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense in 2005 are the
      primary reasons for the $33 million increase in taxes, other than income,
      compared with 2004.

The
      reversal of the PURTA tax liability is the primary reason for the $12 million
      decrease in taxes, other than income in 2004, compared with 2003. Also
      contributing to the decrease was lower capital stock tax expense. These
      decreases were partially offset by higher gross receipts tax
      expense.

Workforce
      Reduction

See
      Note
      20 to the Financial Statements for information on the $9 million charge recorded
      in 2003.

Other
      Income - net

See
      Note
      16 to the Financial Statements for details of other income and
      deductions.

Interest
      Expense

Interest
      expense, including interest expense with affiliate, decreased by $8 million
      in
      2005 compared with 2004 and by $21 million in 2004 compared with 2003. These
      decreases primarily reflect the net impact of long-term debt retirements and
      new
      issuances. Over the past two years, $953 million of long-term debt retirements
      have occurred, while new issuances over the same period totaled $424 million.
      The decrease in 2005 was partially offset by $8 million of interest accrued
      for
      the PJM billing dispute and $9 million of additional interest paid on collateral
      held by PPL Electric relating to the PLR contract. See Note 15 to the Financial
      Statements for further discussion of collateral held under the PLR
      contract.

Income
      Taxes

Income
      tax expense increased by $61 million in 2005 compared with 2004. This increase
      was primarily attributable to:

·

a
                $50 million increase in income tax expense related to higher pre-tax
                book
                income; and

·

a
                $10 million reduction in tax benefits in 2005 related to federal
                and state
                income tax reserves that included a $15 million decrease in tax benefits
                associated with stranded costs securitization, offset by a $5 million
                increase in tax benefits associated with other income tax reserves,
                predicated upon management's reassessment of its best estimate of
                probable
                tax exposure relative to 2004.

Income
      tax expense decreased by $10 million in 2004 compared with 2003. This decrease
      was primarily attributable to:

·

a
                $22 million tax benefit recognized in 2004 related to a reduction
                in tax
                reserves associated with stranded costs securitization predicated
                upon
                management's reassessment of its best estimate of probable tax exposure
                relative to 2003; offset by

·

a
                $15 million increase in income tax expense related to higher pre-tax
                book
                income.

Annual
      tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
      may
      result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities.
      However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by
      such
      authorities may differ materially from the amount accrued. In evaluating the
      exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL Electric accounts for
      changes in probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount
      that should be recognized. An allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies,
      the balance of which management believes to be adequate. During 2004, PPL
      Electric reached partial settlement with the IRS with respect to the tax years
      1991 through 1995 and received a cash refund in the amount of $45 million.
      As a
      result of this settlement, the net tax impact recorded in 2004 was not
      significant.

See
      Note
      5 to the Financial Statements for details on effective income tax rates and
      other income tax related matters.

Financial
      Condition

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

PPL
      Electric is focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and
      strengthening its balance sheet, thereby continuing to improve its credit
      profile. PPL Electric believes that its cash on hand, short-term investments,
      operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing
      capacity, taken as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing
      operating requirements, future security maturities and estimated future capital
      expenditures. PPL Electric currently expects cash, cash equivalents and
      short-term investments at the end of 2006 to be approximately $100 million,
      while maintaining approximately $200 million in credit facilities and up to
      $150
      million in short-term debt capacity related to an asset-backed commercial paper
      program. However, PPL Electric's cash flows from operations and its access
      to
      cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties,
      including but not limited to:

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric had $323 million of cash, cash equivalents
      and
      short-term investments and $42 million in short-term debt, compared with $161
      million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $42 million
      of
      short-term debt at December 31, 2004, and $162 million in cash and cash
      equivalents and no short-term investments or short-term debt at December 31,
      2003. The $42 million of short-term debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, is
      entirely from loan proceeds attributable to the asset-backed commercial paper
      program, of which the full amount was used to cash collateralize letters of
      credit. The changes in cash and cash equivalents resulted from:

Operating
      Activities

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities decreased by $318 million in 2005 compared
      with
      2004 and increased by $370 million in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily as
      a
      result of receipts in 2004 of $300 million in cash collateral related to the
      PLR
      energy supply agreements and a federal income tax refund in 2004. The decrease
      for 2005 compared with 2004 was partially mitigated by the 7.1% increase in
      distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries effective January 1,
      2005.

An
      important element supporting the stability of PPL Electric's cash from
      operations is its long-term purchase contracts with PPL EnergyPlus. These
      contracts provide sufficient energy for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
      through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge its
      customers over this period. These contracts require cash collateral or other
      credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire
      contract through cash settlement, in the event of adverse changes in market
      prices. Also under the contracts, PPL Energy Supply may request cash collateral
      or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of
      the
      entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of PPL
      Electric's credit ratings. The maximum amount that PPL Electric would have
      to
      post under these contracts is $300 million, and PPL Electric estimates that
      it
      would not have had to post any collateral if energy prices decreased by 10%
      from
      year-end 2005 or 2004 levels.

Investing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities decreased by $330 million in 2005 compared with
      2004, and increased by $378 million in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily as
      a
      result of initiating a $300 million demand loan to an affiliate in 2004. The
      primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures. See
      "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding capital expenditures in 2005
      and
      projected expenditures for the years 2006 through 2010.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in financing activities decreased by $146 million in 2005 compared with
      2004, primarily due to a decrease of $217 million in net debt retirements,
      partially offset by an increase of $69 million in dividends paid to PPL
      Corporation. Net cash used in financing activities increased by $136 million
      in
      2004 compared with 2003, due to higher net retirements of long-term debt in
      2004. See "Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans
      to issue debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility
      capacity available to PPL Electric. Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for
      a
      discussion of PPL Electric's plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred
      securities, as well as maturities of PPL Electric's long-term debt.

PPL
      Electric's debt financing activity in 2005 was:

Debt
      issued during 2005 had stated interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 5.15% and
      with maturities from 2005 through 2029. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
      for more detailed information regarding PPL Electric's financing
      activities.

Forecasted
      Sources of Cash

PPL
      Electric expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
      in
      the near term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper program,
      an asset-backed commercial paper program and operating leases. PPL Electric
      also
      expects to continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets, as
      necessary, for its long-term financing needs.

Credit
      Facilities

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric's total committed borrowing capacity under
      credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

(a)

Borrowings
                under PPL Electric's credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR-based
                rates
                plus a spread, depending upon the company's public debt rating. PPL
                Electric also has the capability to cause the lenders to issue up
                to $300
                million of letters of credit under these facilities, which issuances
                reduce available borrowing capacity.

The
                credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to
                total
                capitalization to not exceed 70%. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
                PPL
                Electric's consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages,
                as
                calculated in accordance with its credit facilities, were 55% and
                54%. The
                credit facilities also contain standard representations and warranties
                that must be made for PPL Electric to borrow under
                them.

(b)

PPL
                Electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters
                of
                credit are drawn upon.

In
      addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
      agreements contain various other covenants. Failure to meet the covenants beyond
      applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings
      and/or termination of the agreements. PPL Electric monitors the covenants on
      a
      regular basis. At December 31, 2005, PPL Electric was in material compliance
      with those covenants. At this time PPL Electric believes that these covenants
      and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.
      PPL Electric intends to renew and extend $200 million of its credit facility
      capacity in 2006. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion
      of PPL Electric's credit facilities.

Commercial
      Paper

PPL
      Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
      it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
      if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by credit
      agreements of PPL Electric. PPL Electric had no commercial paper outstanding
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004. During 2006, PPL Electric may issue commercial
      paper from time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow needs.

Asset-Backed
      Commercial Paper Program

PPL
      Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
      PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
      receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary
      on
      an ongoing basis. The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of up
      to
      an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a
      financial institution. PPL Electric uses the proceeds from the program for
      general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of credit. At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the loan balance outstanding was $42 million, all
      of
      which was being used to cash collateralize letters of credit. See Note 8 to
      the
      Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial
      paper
      program.

Operating
      Leases

PPL
      Electric also has available funding sources that are provided through operating
      leases. PPL Electric leases vehicles, office space, land, buildings, personal
      computers and other equipment. These leasing structures provide PPL Electric
      with additional operating and financing flexibility. The operating leases
      contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining
      insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other
      fees. Failure to meet these covenants could limit or restrict access to these
      funds or require early payment of obligations. At this time, PPL Electric
      believes that these covenants will not limit access to these funding sources
      or
      cause acceleration or termination of the leases.

See
      Note
      10 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
      leases.

Long-Term
      Debt and Equity Securities

PPL
      Electric currently does not plan to issue any long-term debt securities in
      2006.
      Subject to market conditions in 2006, PPL Electric currently plans to sell
      $250
      million in preferred securities. PPL Electric expects to use the proceeds
      primarily to repurchase securities, including stock from its parent, and for
      general corporate purposes.

Forecasted
      Uses of Cash

In
      addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
      purchased power, payroll, and taxes, PPL Electric currently expects to incur
      future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations,
      payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities and the repurchase
      of a portion of its common stock.

Capital
      Expenditures

The
      table
      below shows PPL Electric's current capital expenditure projections for the
      years
      2006 through 2010 and actual spending for the year 2005.

(a)

Construction
                expenditures include AFUDC, which is expected to be approximately
                $15
                million for the 2006-2010 period.

PPL
      Electric's capital expenditure projections for the years 2006-2010 total
      approximately $1.3 billion. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically
      to reflect changes in market and regulatory conditions.

PPL
      Electric plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2006 with cash on
      hand
      and cash from operations.

Contractual
      Obligations

PPL
      Electric has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the
      ordinary course of conducting its business. At December 31, 2005, the estimated
      contractual cash obligations of PPL Electric were:

(a)

Reflects
                principal maturities only. Includes $892 million of transition bonds
                issued by PPL Transition Bond Company in 1999 to securitize a portion
                of
                PPL Electric's stranded costs. This debt is non-recourse to PPL
                Electric.

(b)

The
                payments reflected herein are subject to change, as the purchase
                obligation reflected is an estimate based on projected obligated
                quantities and projected pricing under the contract. Purchase orders
                made
                in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts
                presented.

Dividends

From
      time
      to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Electric pays dividends
      on
      its common stock to its parent, PPL, which uses the dividends for general
      corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs. PPL Electric expects
      to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding preferred stock,
      and
      to pay quarterly dividends on the preferred securities expected to be issued
      in
      2006, in each case if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

PPL
      Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments in
      the
      event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to
      comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation
      and
      Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other subsidiaries.
      PPL
      Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would
      significantly impact its ability to declare dividends.

Common
      Stock Repurchase

PPL
      Electric plans to repurchase approximately $200 million of common stock from
      its
      parent in 2006. The repurchase is expected to be funded with proceeds received
      from the sale of preferred securities.

Credit
      Ratings

Moody's,
      S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
      preferred securities of PPL Electric and PPL Transition Bond Company. Based
      on
      their respective reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings
      revisions.

A
      credit
      rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit worthiness
      associated with particular securities issued by PPL Electric and PPL Transition
      Bond Company, based on information provided by PPL Electric and other sources.
      The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell
      or hold any securities of PPL Electric or PPL Transition Bond Company. Such
      ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time
      and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that
      may be assigned to their securities. A downgrade in PPL Electric's or PPL
      Transition Bond Company's credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs
      and reduced access to capital markets.

The
      following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL Electric and PPL Transition
      Bond Company at December 31, 2005.

(a)

Insured
                as to payment of principal and interest.

(b)

Issuer
                Rating for Fitch is an "Issuer Default
                Rating."

Moody's
      did not take any actions on the debt and

preferred
      securities of PPL Electric and PPL Transition Bond Company in 2005.

In
      January 2005, S&P affirmed PPL Electric's A-/A-2 corporate credit ratings
      and favorably revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative
      following the authorization of a $194 million rate increase by the PUC. S&P
      indicated that the outlook revision reflects its expectations that the rate
      increase, effective January 1, 2005, will allow for material improvement in
      PPL Electric's financial profile, which had lagged S&P's expectations in
      recent years. S&P indicated that the stable outlook reflects its
      expectations that PPL Electric "will rapidly improve and then maintain financial
      metrics more consistent with its ratings." S&P indicated that it expects PPL
      Electric's operations to remain stable through the expiration of the PLR
      agreement.

In
      October 2005, S&P affirmed its ratings of PPL Electric. The ratings
      affirmation is the result of S&P's annual review of PPL Electric, including
      its business and financial risk profiles.

In
      December 2005, Fitch assigned issuer default ratings (IDRs) for its North
      American global power portfolio of issuers with ratings of BB- or higher. The
      IDR reflects Fitch's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its
      financial commitments on a timely basis, effectively becoming its benchmark
      probability of default. Fitch rates securities in an issuer's capital structure
      higher, lower or the same as the IDR based on Fitch's assessment of a particular
      security's relative recovery prospects. There were no changes in Fitch's
      securities ratings at PPL Electric as a result of Fitch's assignment of an
      IDR.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements

PPL
      Electric has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the
      scope
      of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
      Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation
      of
      FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No.

Commodity
      Price Risk - PLR Contracts

PPL
      Electric and PPL EnergyPlus have power supply agreements under which PPL
      EnergyPlus sells to PPL Electric (under a predetermined pricing arrangement)
      energy and capacity to fulfill PPL Electric's PLR obligation through 2009.
      As a
      result, PPL Electric has shifted any electric price risk relating to its PLR
      obligation to PPL EnergyPlus through 2009. See Note 15 to the Financial
      Statements for information on the PLR contracts.

Interest
      Rate Risk

PPL
      Electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which increases its interest
      rate risk. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, PPL Electric's potential annual
      exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest
      rates, was insignificant.

PPL
      Electric is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio.
      At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric estimated that its potential exposure to a
      change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement
      in interest rates, was approximately $43 million, compared with $50 million
      at
      December 31, 2004.

Related
      Party Transactions

PPL
      Electric is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating
      responsibility by senior management of PPL Electric in outside partnerships,
      including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other
      entities doing business with PPL Electric.

Application
      of Critical Accounting Policies

PPL
      Electric's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the
      methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
      accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly
      important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL Electric,
      and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain.
      Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting
      policies could result in a significant change to the information presented
      in
      the financial statements. (These accounting policies are also discussed in
      Note
      1 to the Financial Statements.) PPL's senior management has reviewed these
      critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them,
      with its Audit Committee. In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed
      the
      following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting
      policies with the Audit Committee.

1)

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefits

As
      described in Note 12 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric participates
      in,
      and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension
      cost of the PPL Retirement Plan and the PPL Postretirement Benefit Plan. PPL
      follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and
      SFAS
      106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
      when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards,
      assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and
      performance of plan assets. Delayed recognition of differences between actual
      results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these
      standards. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed
      recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the
      working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary
      assumptions are:

In
      selecting discount rates, PPL considers the expected cash outflows of its plans
      matched against appropriate fixed-income security yield rates. This information
      is first matched against a spot-rate yield curve. A portfolio of nearly 600
      Moody's Aa-graded non-callable corporate bonds, with a total outstanding float
      in excess of $300 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest
      and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve. The
      results of this analysis are considered in conjunction with other economic
      data
      and consideration of movements in the Moody's Aa bond index to determine the
      discount rate assumption. At December 31, 2005, PPL decreased the discount
      rate
      for its domestic plans from 5.75% to 5.70% as a result of decreased long
      duration fixed-income security returns.

In
      selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
      past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by
      the
      plans. At December 31, 2005, PPL's expected return on plan assets was decreased
      from 8.75% to 8.50% for its domestic pension plans and increased to 8.00% from
      7.90% for its other postretirement benefit plans. PPL's domestic pension plans
      have significantly exceeded the expected return on plan assets for 2004 and
      2005. However, the expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased
      to
      reflect a long-term view of equity markets and an expected increase in long-term
      bond yields.

In
      selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
      light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2005, PPL's rate of
      compensation increase was moved to 4.75% from 4.00% for its domestic plans.

In
      selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
      forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2005, PPL's health care
      cost trend rates were 10.0% for 2006, gradually declining to 5.5% for
      2011.

A
      variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
      the
      accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual
      net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost allocated to PPL
      Electric. The following chart reflects the sensitivities in the 2005 financial
      statements associated with a change in certain assumptions. While the chart
      below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse
      of
      this change would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit
      liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement
      benefit cost by a similar amount in the opposite direction. Each sensitivity
      below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
      assumption.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric's Balance Sheet reflected a net liability of
      $75
      million for pension liabilities and prepaid other postretirement benefit costs
      allocated from plans sponsored by PPL Services.

In
      2005,
      PPL Electric was allocated net periodic pension and other postretirement costs
      charged to operating expense of $11 million. This amount represents a $1 million
      increase compared with the charge recognized during 2004. This increase was
      primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31,
      2004.

Refer
      to
      Note 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding pension
      and other postretirement benefits.

Loss
      Accruals

PPL
      Electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
      conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. These
      events are called "contingencies," and PPL Electric's accounting for such events
      is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and other related
      accounting guidance. SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing condition,
      situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain
      or
      loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future
      events occur or fail to occur."

For
      loss
      contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
      indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
      of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
      estimated. FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events
      are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit the accrual of contingencies that
      might result in gains. PPL Electric continuously assesses potential loss
      contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, income taxes,
      regulatory penalties and other events.

The
      accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include: (1) the initial
      identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of triggering
      events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing assessment
      as
      to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects
      of
      accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL Electric's
      management.

Initial
      Identification and Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
      Electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers,
      tax
      specialists and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability
      that
      a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In
      2005,
      a significant loss accrual was recorded for the PJM billing dispute. Significant
      judgment was required by PPL Electric's management to perform the initial
      assessment of this contingency. In December 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf
      of its subsidiary, PECO Energy, Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM
      and
      PPL Electric with the FERC, alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April
      1998 through May 2003 as a result of an error by PJM. The complaint requested
      the FERC, among other things, to direct PPL Electric to refund to PJM $39
      million, plus interest of approximately $8 million, and for PJM to refund these
      same amounts to PECO. In April 2005, the FERC issued an Order Establishing
      Hearing and Settlement Judge Proceedings (the Order). In the Order, the FERC
      determined that PECO was entitled to reimbursement for the transmission
      congestion charges that PECO asserted PJM erroneously billed. The FERC ordered
      settlement discussions, before a judge, to determine the amount of the
      overcharge to PECO and the parties responsible for reimbursement to PECO.

Based
      on
      an evaluation of FERC's Order, PPL Electric's management concluded that it
      was
      probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the PJM billing
      dispute. PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual of $47 million, the amount of
      PECO's claim, in the first quarter of 2005. See Note 14 to the Financial
      Statements for additional information.

See
      "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a discussion of the year-end
      2005 assessment of this contingency.

PPL
      Electric has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss,
      but
      that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5. SFAS 5 requires
      disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably
      possible" that a loss has been incurred. The FASB defines "reasonably possible"
      as cases in which "the chance of the future event or events occurring is more
      than remote but less than likely." See Note 14 to the Financial Statements
      for
      disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria
      for accrual under SFAS 5.

Reducing
      Recorded Loss Accruals

When
      an
      estimated loss is accrued, PPL Electric identifies, where applicable, the
      triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual. The triggering
      events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
      loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.
      The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction
      of certain recorded loss accruals:

Ongoing
      Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
      Electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
      recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient. This involves ongoing
      communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
      tax specialists, operation management and other parties.

Significant
      management judgment is required in developing PPL

Electric's contingencies, or reserves, for income taxes and valuation allowances
      for deferred tax assets. The ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended
      to result in management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position
      for
      each tax year. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient
      to
      pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns
      by
      taxing authorities. However, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of
      any
      issues raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued. In
      evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, PPL Electric
      accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management's best estimate
      of the amount that should be recognized. An allowance is maintained for the
      tax
      contingencies, the balance of which management believes to be adequate. The
      ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment of whether
      deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized. Management considers a number
      of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets,
      including forecasts of taxable income in future periods.

As
      part
      of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL Electric's
      management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the PJM billing dispute,
      described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
      Accrual." In re-assessing the PJM billing dispute, PPL Electric's management
      considered the proposed settlement agreement that was filed with FERC in
      September 2005. Under the settlement agreement, PPL Electric would pay $33
      million plus interest over a four-year period to PJM through a new transmission
      charge that, under applicable law, is recoverable from PPL Electric's retail
      customers. Also, all PJM market participants would pay approximately $8 million
      plus interest over a four-year period to PJM through a new market adjustment
      charge. PJM would forward amounts collected under the two new charges to PECO.
      See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Numerous
      parties filed comments with the FERC opposing the settlement agreement, and
      the
      FERC has not yet acted on the proposed settlement agreement. Accordingly, PPL
      Electric's management had no basis to revise the loss accrual that was recorded
      in the first quarter of 2005. PPL Electric's management will continue to assess
      the loss accrual for this contingency for future periods.

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation:

We
      have
      completed

integrated
      audits of PPL Corporation's 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements
      and
      of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and
      an
      audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
      standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
      Our
      opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated

financial statements and financial statement schedule

In
      our
      opinion,

the
      consolidated

financial statements listed

in
      the

accompanying
      index

present
      fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

PPL
      Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
      years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity

with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

In
      addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
      accompanying index

present

s

fairly,
      in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
      conjunction with the related

consolidated

financial
      statements.

These
      financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility
      of
      the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
      financial statements and financial statement

schedule

based

on our
      audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
      standards of the

Public
      Company Accounting Oversight Board

(United
      States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
      reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
      misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
      basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-11,

Reporting
        Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB
        Statement No. 133 and Not "Held for Trading Purposes" as Defined in Issue
        No. 02-3

in
        2003.

As
        discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150,

Accounting
        for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
        and
        Equity

,
        in

.

As
        discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting
        for Asset Retirement Obligations

,
        in
        2003. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the
        Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46,

Consolidation
        of Variable Interest Entities -- an interpretation of ARB 51

,

as
        amended by FIN No. 46(R), in 2003. As discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated
        financial statements, the Company adopted FIN No. 47,

Accounting
        for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,

in
        2005.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management's assessment, included in "Management's Report on
      Internal Control Over Financial Reporting"

appearing
      under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
      financial reporting as of

December
      31, 2005

based
      on
      criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December
      31, 2005

,
      based
      on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness
      of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
      We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
      internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
      of
      internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment,
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
      circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
      opinions.

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
      over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

              audits. We
              conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards
              of the
              Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
              require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
              about
              whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
              An audit
              includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
              and
              disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
              used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
              overall
              financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
              a
              reasonable basis for our opinion.

Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Business
      and Consolidation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      is an
      energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily
      engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in the northeastern
      and
      western U.S. and in the delivery of electricity in Pennsylvania, the U.K. and
      Latin America. Based in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal direct subsidiaries
      are
      PPL Energy Funding, PPL Electric, PPL Gas Utilities, PPL Services and PPL
      Capital Funding.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Energy Funding is the parent of PPL Energy Supply, which serves as the holding
      company for PPL's principal unregulated subsidiaries. PPL Energy Supply is
      the
      parent of PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Global.

PPL
      Generation owns and operates a portfolio of domestic power generating assets.
      These power plants are located in Pennsylvania, Montana, Arizona, Illinois,
      Connecticut, New York and Maine and use well-diversified fuel sources including
      coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water. PPL EnergyPlus markets or brokers
      electricity produced by PPL Generation, along with purchased power, natural
      gas
      and oil, in competitive wholesale and deregulated retail markets, primarily
      in
      the northeastern and western portions of the U.S. PPL Global owns and operates
      international energy businesses that are primarily focused on the distribution
      of electricity.

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric is a rate-regulated subsidiary of PPL. PPL Electric's principal
      businesses are the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail
      customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania,
      and
      the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a
      PLR.

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
      consolidated financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
      include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities
      in
      which the company has a controlling financial interest. Investments in entities
      in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence but
      does
      not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity
      method. See Note 3 for further discussion. All other investments are carried
      at
      cost or fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been
      eliminated. Any minority interests are reflected in the consolidated financial
      statements.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

It
      is the
      policy of PPL and PPL Energy Supply to consolidate or record equity in earnings
      of foreign entities on a lag, based on the availability of financial data on
      a
      U.S. GAAP basis:

·

PPL
                and PPL Energy Supply consolidate the results of foreign entities
                in which
                they have a controlling financial interest (WPD, Emel, EC, the Bolivian
                subsidiaries and other investments) on a one-month lag.

·

Earnings
                from foreign equity method investments are recorded on a three-month
                lag.

Effective
      December 31, 2003, PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's consolidated financial
      statements include the accounts of the lessors under the operating leases for
      the Sundance, University Park and Lower Mt. Bethel generation facilities. In
      June 2004, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries purchased the Sundance and University
      Park generation assets from the lessor. See Note 22 for further discussion.
      In
      May 2005, a subsidiary of PPL Generation completed the sale of its Sundance
      generation assets to Arizona Public Service Company. See Note 9 for further
      discussion.

Effective
      December 31, 2003, PPL deconsolidated PPL Capital Funding Trust I, a wholly
      owned trust. PPL and PPL Energy Supply deconsolidated SIUK Capital Trust I,
      also
      a wholly owned trust. See Note 22 for further discussion.

The
      consolidated financial statements of PPL and PPL Energy Supply include their
      share of undivided interests in jointly-owned facilities, as well as their
      share
      of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 13 for additional
      information.

Regulation

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric and PPL Gas Utilities account for regulated operations in accordance
      with the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
      of
      Regulation," which requires rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects
      of
      regulatory decisions in their financial statements.

The
      following regulatory assets were included in the "Regulatory and Other
      Noncurrent Assets" section of the Balance Sheet at December 31.

Based
      on
      the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric began amortizing its competitive transition
      (or stranded) costs, $2.97 billion, over an 11-year transition period effective
      January 1, 1999. In August 1999, competitive transition costs of $2.4
      billion were converted to intangible transition costs when they were securitized
      by the issuance of transition bonds. The intangible transition costs are being
      amortized over the life of the transition bonds, through December 2008, in
      accordance with an amortization schedule filed with the PUC. The assets of
      PPL
      Transition Bond Company, including the intangible transition property, are
      not
      available to creditors of PPL or PPL Electric. The transition bonds are
      obligations of PPL Transition Bond Company and are non-recourse to PPL and
      PPL
      Electric. The remaining competitive transition costs are also being amortized
      based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the PUC, adjusted for
      those competitive transition costs that were converted to intangible transition
      costs. As a result of the conversion of a significant portion of the competitive
      transition costs into intangible transition costs, amortization of substantially
      all of the remaining competitive transition costs will occur in
      2009.

Included
      in "Other" above as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, were approximately $10
      million and $11 million of storm restoration costs associated with the September
      2003 Hurricane Isabel. PPL Electric deferred these costs based on assessment
      of
      the PUC declaratory order of January 2004.

The
      costs
      are being recovered through customer transmission and distribution rates, and
      are being amortized over ten years effective January 1, 2005.

Also
      included in "Other" at December 31, 2005, were approximately $12 million of
      costs associated with severe ice storms in PPL Electric's service territory
      in
      January 2005. These costs have been deferred based on an assessment of an order
      issued by the PUC on August 26, 2005. The ratemaking treatment of these costs
      will be addressed in PPL Electric's next distribution base rate case. PPL and
      PPL Electric believe there is a reasonable basis for recovery of all regulatory
      assets.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Elfec
      accounts for regulated operations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
      71.
      Regulatory assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
      insignificant.

Accounting
      Records

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

The
      system of accounts for PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities are maintained in
      accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and
      adopted by the PUC.

Use
      of
      Estimates

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
      management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
      of
      assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date
      of
      the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

Loss
      Accruals

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Loss
      accruals are recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
      and other related accounting guidance. Potential losses are accrued when (1)
      information is available that indicates it is "probable" that the loss has
      been
      incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount
      of the loss can be reasonably estimated. FASB defines "probable" as cases in
      which "the future event or events are likely to occur." SFAS 5 does not permit
      the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains. PPL continuously
      assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation
      claims, income taxes, regulatory penalties and other events.

PPL
      also
      has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
      events have occurred. For example, estimated losses were accrued when long-term
      purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and

when
      PPL
      Electric's generation business was deregulated.

Changes
      in Classification

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
      classification of certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements
      have
      been changed to conform to the current presentation. The changes in
      classification did not affect net income or total equity.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      addition, based on recent

clarifications
      of

accounting
      guidance, the Statement of Cash Flows has been revised to reflect the purchases
      and sales of emission allowances, and the purchases and sales of investments
      in
      the nuclear decommissioning trust, on a gross basis within "Cash Flows from
      Investing Activities." Previously, these cash flows were presented on a net
      basis within "Cash Flows f

rom

Operating Activities

.

"

The
      net
      impact of this revised presentation was to increase "

Cash
      Flows f

rom

Operating Activities" and to decrease "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"
      by
      $63 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003. This revision had no impact on
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents" for the periods reported.

This
      revision is not considered by management as material to the Financial
      Statements.

See
      Note
      19 for additional information regarding emission allowances and Note 21 for
      additional information regarding investments in the nuclear decommissioning
      trust.

Comprehensive
      Income

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Comprehensive
      income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as changes
      in common equity from transactions not related to shareowners. Comprehensive
      income is shown on PPL's Statement of Shareowners' Common Equity and
      Comprehensive Income and PPL Energy Supply's Statement of Member's Equity and
      Comprehensive Income.

Accumulated
      other comprehensive loss, which is presented on the Balance Sheet of PPL and
      included in Member's Equity on the PPL Energy Supply Balance Sheet, consisted
      of
      these after-tax amounts at December 31.

Price
      Risk Management

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the
      variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units and
      marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. PPL and PPL Energy Supply
      enter into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge their exposure to changes
      in the fair value of their debt instruments and to hedge their exposure to
      variability in expected cash flows associated with existing debt instruments
      or
      forecasted transactions. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign
      currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, including
      firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions,
      net
      investments, or foreign earnings translation.

Contracts
      that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS 133,
      "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
      and
      interpreted. Certain energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements
      of SFAS 133 because they meet the definition of a "normal purchase or normal
      sale." These contracts are reflected in the financial statements using the
      accrual method of accounting.

Additionally,
      PPL and PPL Energy Supply adopted SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133
      on
      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as of July 1, 2003. The
      requirements of SFAS 149, which required prospective application, placed
      additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale
      exception.

All
      derivative contracts that are subject to the requirements of SFAS 133 and its
      amendments are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value. On the date
      the derivative contract is executed, PPL may designate the derivative as a
      hedge
      of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized
      firm
      commitment ("fair value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of
      the
      variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
      or liability ("cash flow" hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow
      hedge ("foreign currency" hedge), or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
      operation ("net investment" hedge). Changes in the fair value of derivatives
      are
      recorded in either other comprehensive income or in current-period earnings
      in
      accordance with SFAS 133.

Unrealized
      gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy contracts accounted
      for
      as fair value hedges are reflected in "Energy purchases" on the Statement of
      Income, as are changes in the underlying positions. Realized gains and losses
      from energy contracts accounted for as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges,
      when recognized on the Statement of Income, are reflected in "Fuel" or "Energy
      purchases," consistent with the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of
      derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are reflected in
      "Net
      energy trading margins" revenues. However, unrealized gains and losses on FTRs
      and options to hedge synthetic fuel tax credits, which are not designated as
      hedging instruments, are reflected in "Energy purchases" and "Energy-related
      business" revenues, respectively. Gains and losses from interest rate and
      foreign currency derivative contracts that hedge interest payments, when
      recognized on the Statement of Income, are accounted for in "Interest Expense."
      Gains and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts that economically
      hedge foreign earnings translation are recognized in "Other Income - net."
      Gains
      and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts that hedge foreign
      currency payments for equipment, when recognized on the Statement of Income,
      are
      accounted for in "Depreciation."

Under
      EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for
      Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
      Activities," PPL reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses
      associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in "Net
      energy trading margins" revenues on the Statement of Income. The physical
      volumes for electricity and gas associated with energy trading were 5,800 GWh
      and 13.4 Bcf in 2005; 5,700 GWh and 11.7 Bcf in 2004; and 5,200 GWh and 12.6
      Bcf
      in 2003.

PPL
      Energy Supply adopted the final provisions of EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized
      Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement
      No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3,"
      prospectively as of October 1, 2003. As a result of the adoption, non-trading
      bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with
      purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points. A major market
      delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available.

See
      Note
      17 for additional information on SFAS 133, its amendments and related accounting
      guidance.

Revenue

Utility
      Revenue

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      Statement of Income "Utility" line item contains revenues from domestic and
      international rate-regulated delivery operations.

WPD
      revenues are stated net of value-added tax.

(PPL
      Electric)

Since
      most of PPL Electric's operations are regulated, it is not meaningful to use
      a
      "Utility" caption. Therefore, the revenues of PPL Electric are presented
      according to specific types of revenue.

Revenue
      Recognition

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Operating
      revenues, except for "Energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy
      deliveries through the end of the calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues
      result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout
      the
      month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues
      for
      a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the
      estimated average cents per kWh. Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded
      at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are
      confirmed and invoiced. At that time, unbilled revenue is reversed and actual
      revenue is recorded.

PPL
      records energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered.
      The wholesale sales and purchases that meet the criteria in EITF 03-11 are
      reported net on the Statement of Income within "Wholesale energy marketing."
      Additionally, the bilateral sales and purchases that are designated as trading
      activities are also reported net, in accordance with EITF 02-3 and are reported
      on the Statement of Income within "Net energy trading margins." Spot market
      activity that balances PPL's physical trading positions is included on the
      Statement of Income in "Net energy trading margins."

Certain
      PPL subsidiaries participate in RTOs, primarily in PJM, but also in the
      surrounding regions of New York (NYISO), New England (ISO-NE) and the Midwest
      (MISO). In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity to its
      customers who have selected it as a supplier and a seller for PPL's generation
      subsidiaries. PPL Electric is a transmission owner and PLR in PJM. In ISO-NE,
      PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity, and a seller for PPL's
      New
      England generating assets. In the NYISO and MISO regions, PPL EnergyPlus acts
      as
      a marketer. PPL Electric does not participate in ISO-NE, NYISO or MISO. A
      function of interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements
      (generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their MWh obligations
      (load plus scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day. If the
      net
      result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited
      with
      a spot-market sale to the ISO at the respective market price for that hour;
      if
      the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market
      purchase from the ISO at the respective market price for that hour. ISO
      purchases and sales are not allocated to individual customers. PPL records
      the
      hourly net sales and purchases in its financial statements as sales to and
      purchases from the respective ISOs.

"Energy-related
      businesses" revenue includes revenues from the mechanical contracting and
      engineering subsidiaries, WPD's telecommunications and property subsidiaries
      and
      PPL Global's proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity or
      cost
      method of accounting, as described in the "Business and Consolidation" section
      of Note 1. The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record
      profits from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method
      of
      accounting. Income from time and material contracts is recognized currently
      as
      the work is performed.

Allowance
      for Doubtful Accounts

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Accounts
      receivable collectibility is evaluated using a combination of factors. Reserve
      balances are analyzed to assess the reasonableness of the balances in comparison
      to the actual accounts receivable balances and write-offs. Adjustments are
      made
      to reserve balances based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables,
      and historical and industry trends.

Additional
      specific reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, such as bankruptcies,
      are recorded on a case-by-case basis after having been researched and reviewed
      by management. Unusual items, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable,
      counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions are considered as a basis
      for determining the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible account
      balances.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL's
      and
      PPL Energy Supply's significant specific reserves relate to receivables from
      Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001, and from the California ISO, which
      has withheld payment pending the outcome of regulatory proceedings arising
      from
      the California electricity supply situation that began in 2000. At December
      31,
      2005 and 2004, these two reserves accounted for 60% and 59% of PPL's total
      allowance for doubtful accounts and 80% and 76% of PPL Energy Supply's
      total allowance for doubtful accounts.

Cash
      and Investments

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Cash
      Equivalents

All
      highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
      months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

PPL
      invests in auction rate and similar securities which provide for periodic reset
      of interest rates and are highly liquid. Even though PPL considers these debt
      securities as part of its liquid portfolio, it does not include these securities
      in cash and cash equivalents due to the stated maturity of the securities.
      These
      securities are included in "Current Assets - Other" on the Balance
      Sheet.

Restricted
      Cash

Bank
      deposits that are restricted by agreement or that have been designated for
      a
      specific purpose are classified as restricted cash. The change in restricted
      cash is reported as an investing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows. On
      the
      Balance Sheet, the current portion of restricted cash is shown as "Restricted
      cash" within current assets, while the noncurrent portion is included in "Other"
      within other noncurrent assets. See Note 18 for the components of restricted
      cash.

Investments
      in Debt and Marketable Equity Securities

Investments
      in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, and measured at amortized
      cost, when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
      Debt securities and marketable equity securities that are acquired and held
      principally for the purpose of selling them in the near-term are classified
      as
      trading. All other investments in debt and marketable equity securities are
      classified as available-for-sale. Both trading and available-for-sale securities
      are carried at fair value. Any unrealized gains and losses for trading
      securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses for
      available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive
      income or are recognized currently in earnings when a decline in fair value
      is
      determined to be other than temporary. The specific identification method is
      used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and marketable equity
      securities. See Note 21 for additional information on securities held in the
      nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Long-Lived
      and Intangible Assets

Property,
      Plant and Equipment

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PP&E
      is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. If impaired, the asset is written
      down to fair value at that time, which becomes the asset's new cost basis.
      Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads
      and financing costs, where applicable. The cost of repairs and minor
      replacements are charged to expense as incurred. PPL records costs associated
      with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are
      incurred. No costs are accrued in advance of the period in which the work is
      performed.

AFUDC
      is
      capitalized as part of the construction costs for regulated projects. Interest
      is capitalized as part of construction costs for non-regulated
      projects.

(PPL)

Included
      in PP&E on the balance sheet are capitalized costs of software projects that
      were developed or obtained for internal use. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      capitalized software costs were $92 million and $83 million, and there was
      $57
      million and $46 million of accumulated amortization. Such capitalized amounts
      are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become
      operational, generally not to exceed 10 years. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      PPL
      amortized capitalized software costs of $13 million, $11 million and $14
      million.

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

Included
      in PP&E on the balance sheet are capitalized costs of software projects that
      were developed or obtained for internal use. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      capitalized software costs were $54 million and $52 million, and there was
      $38
      million and $33 million of accumulated amortization. Such capitalized amounts
      are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become
      operational, generally not to exceed 10 years. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      PPL
      Energy Supply amortized capitalized software costs of $6 million, $5 million
      and
      $7 million.

(PPL
      Electric)

Included
      in PP&E on the balance sheet are capitalized costs of software projects that
      were developed or obtained for internal use. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      capitalized software costs were $21 million and $20 million. At December 31,
      2005 and 2004, accumulated amortization was $12 million and $8 million. Such
      capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the
      projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed 5 years. During
      2005, 2004 and 2003, PPL Electric amortized capitalized software costs of $4
      million, $4 million and $5 million.

Depreciation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Depreciation
      is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods
      including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component
      of
      PP&E is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method,
      the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a
      significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the
      composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related
      accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included
      in
      income, unless otherwise required by regulators.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries periodically review the useful lives of their fixed assets.
      In
      light of significant planned environmental capital expenditures, PPL Generation
      conducted studies of the useful lives of Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner
      Island Unit 3 during the first quarter of 2005. Based on these studies, the
      useful lives of these units were extended from 2025 to 2035, effective January
      1, 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, PPL Generation conducted additional
      studies of the useful lives of certain Eastern fossil-fuel and hydroelectric
      generation plants. The most significant change related to the useful lives
      of
      Brunner Island Units 1 and 2 and Martins Creek Units 3 and 4, which were
      extended from 2025 to 2035, effective July 1, 2005. The effect of these changes
      in useful lives for 2005 was to increase net income, as a result of lower
      depreciation, by approximately $7 million.

As
      a
      result of the final regulatory outcome published by Ofgem of the most recent
      price control review and an assessment of the economic life of meters, WPD
      reduced the remaining depreciable lives of its existing meter stock to
      approximately nine years. The lives of new meters were reduced from 40 years
      to
      19 years. The effect for 2005 was to decrease net income, as a result of higher
      depreciation, by approximately $5 million.

Following
      are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at December 31.

The
      annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance
      with the following ranges, in years, of assets lives.

Goodwill
      and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Goodwill
      represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value
      of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business.
      In accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," PPL and
      its
      subsidiaries do not amortize goodwill.

Other
      acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives are valued at cost
      and
      amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic
      benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used
      up.

Asset
      Impairment

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries review long-lived assets, including intangibles, that are
      subject to depreciation or amortization for impairment when events or
      circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment
      loss is recognized if the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not
      recoverable from undiscounted future cash flow. The impairment charge is
      measured by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its
      fair
      value. See Note 9 for a discussion of asset impairment charges recorded.

Goodwill
      is reviewed for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually or more
      frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
      be
      greater than the implied fair value. PPL's reporting units are one level below
      its operating segments. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
      its
      fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated. If the
      implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference
      represents the amount of impairment.

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      2001,
      the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which
      addresses the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of
      tangible long-lived assets. SFAS 143 requires legal obligations associated
      with
      the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the
      financial statements. The initial obligation is measured at the estimated fair
      value. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the
      capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset.
      Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the
      recognition of accretion expense in the income statement, for changes in the
      obligation due to the passage of time.

In
      2005,
      the FASB issued FIN No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
      Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143" that clarifies certain
      aspects of SFAS 143 related to conditional AROs.

See
      Note
      21 for a discussion of accounting for AROs.

Compensation
      and Benefits

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefits

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
      and
      postemployment benefit plans. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers'
      Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
      Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these
      benefits.

PPL
      uses
      a market-related value of plan assets in accounting for its pension plans.
      The
      market-related value of assets is calculated by rolling forward the prior year
      market-related value with contributions, disbursements and expected return
      on
      investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the
      expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to
      determine the new market-related value.

PPL
      uses
      an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses
      for
      its pension plans. Under the accelerated method, gains and losses in excess
      of
      10% but less than 30% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation
      or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line
      basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants.
      Gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation
      are
      amortized on a straight-line basis over a period equal to one-half of the
      average future service period of the plan participants.

See
      Note
      12 for a discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      grants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock units
      to employees and directors under several stock-based compensation plans. SFAS
      123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages entities to record
      compensation expense for stock-based compensation plans at fair value but
      provides the option of measuring compensation expense using the intrinsic value
      method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees." The fair value method under SFAS 123 is the preferable method of
      accounting for stock-based compensation, as it provides a consistent basis
      of
      accounting for all stock-based awards, thereby facilitating a better measure
      of
      compensation cost and improved financial reporting.

Prior
      to
      2003, PPL and its subsidiaries accounted for stock-based compensation in
      accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS 123. Effective
      January 1, 2003, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of
      accounting for stock-based compensation, as prescribed by SFAS 123, using the
      prospective method of transition permitted by SFAS 148, "Accounting for
      Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB
      Statement No. 123." The prospective method of transition requires PPL and its
      subsidiaries to use the fair value method under SFAS 123 for all stock-based
      compensation awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003.
      Thus, all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003, were accounted for under
      the
      intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25, to the extent such awards are
      not
      modified or settled.

Use
      of
      the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123 requires PPL and its subsidiaries
      to recognize compensation expense for stock options issued. Fair value for
      the
      stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes options pricing model.
      Stock
      options with graded vesting (i.e., that vest in installments) are valued as
      a
      single award.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries were not required to recognize compensation expense for stock
      options issued and accounted for under the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion
      No. 25, since PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less
      than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant. As
      currently structured, awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and
      stock units result in the same amount of compensation expense under the fair
      value method of SFAS 123 as they would under the intrinsic value method of
      APB
      Opinion No. 25. See Note 11 for a discussion of stock-based compensation.
      Stock-based compensation is included in "Other operation and maintenance"
      expense on the Statement of Income.

The
      table
      below illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and EPS as if the fair
      value method had been used to account for all outstanding stock-based
      compensation awards in 2004 and 2003. For 2005, the difference between the
      pro
      forma and reported amounts would have been insignificant.

(PPL)

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

PPL
      Energy Supply's stock-based compensation expense includes an allocation of
      PPL
      Services' expense.

(PPL
      Electric)

PPL
      Electric's stock-based compensation expense, including awards granted to
      employees and an allocation of costs of awards granted to employees of PPL
      Services, was insignificant under both the intrinsic value and fair value
      methods for each of 2005, 2004 and 2003.

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment,"
      which is known as SFAS 123(R) and replaces SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation," as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS
      123(R) effective January 1, 2006. See Note 23 for a discussion of SFAS
      123(R).

In
      SFAS
      123(R), the FASB provided additional guidance on the requirement to accelerate
      expense recognition for employees who are at or near retirement age and who
      are
      under a plan that allows for accelerated vesting upon an employee's retirement.
      Such guidance is relevant to prior accounting for stock-based compensation
      under
      other accounting guidance. PPL's stock-based compensation plans allow for
      accelerated vesting upon an employee's retirement. Thus, for employees who
      are
      retirement eligible when stock-based awards are granted, PPL will recognize
      the
      expense immediately. For employees who are not retirement eligible when
      stock-based awards are granted, PPL will amortize the awards on a straight-line
      basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period up to the employee's
      attainment of retirement age. Retirement eligible has been defined by PPL as
      the
      early retirement age of 55. The adjustments below related to retirement-eligible
      employees were recorded based on the aforementioned clarification of existing
      guidance and are not related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

(PPL)

In
      2005,
      PPL recorded a charge of approximately $10 million after tax, or $0.03 per
      share, to accelerate stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible
      employees. Approximately $5 million of the after-tax total, or $0.01 per share,
      was related to periods prior to 2005. The prior period amounts were not material
      to previously issued financial statements.

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

In
      2005,
      PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of approximately $7 million after tax to
      accelerate stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees.
      Approximately $3 million of the after-tax total was related to periods prior
      to
      2005. The prior period amounts were not material to previously issued financial
      statements.

(PPL
      Electric)

In
      2005,
      PPL Electric recorded a charge of approximately $3 million after tax to
      accelerate stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees.
      Approximately $2 million of the after-tax total was related to periods prior
      to
      2005. The prior period amounts were not material to previously issued financial
      statements.

Other

Income
      Taxes

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
      income tax provision for PPL and its subsidiaries is calculated in accordance
      with SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." PPL and its domestic subsidiaries
      file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

Significant
      management judgment is required in developing PPL's provision for income taxes,
      including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any
      valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets,
      as
      well as estimating the phase-out range for synthetic fuel tax credits that
      is
      not published by the IRS until April of the following year. PPL and its
      subsidiaries record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the
      amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. PPL and its subsidiaries
      have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
      planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. If PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries determined that they would be able to realize deferred tax
      assets in the future in excess of net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the
      deferred tax assets would increase income by reducing tax expense in the period
      that such determination was made. Likewise, if PPL and its subsidiaries
      determined that they would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred
      tax assets in the future, adjustments to the deferred tax assets would decrease
      income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination was
      made.

Annual
      tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
      may
      result from examination by taxing authorities of prior year tax returns; the
      amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by such authorities
      may
      differ materially from the amount accrued and may materially impact PPL's
      financial statements. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax
      filing positions, PPL and its subsidiaries accrue charges for probable exposures
      based on management's best estimate of the amount that should be recognized.
      PPL
      and its subsidiaries maintain an allowance for tax contingencies, the balance
      of
      which management believes to be adequate.

The
      provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in accordance
      with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that the taxable income
      be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric and its domestic
      subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return. PPL Energy Supply's
      intercompany tax liability was $40 million and $44 million at December 31,
      and 2004. PPL Electric's intercompany tax liability was $6 million at
      December 31, 2005, and the intercompany receivable was $5 million at
      December 31, 2004.

PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric deferred investment tax credits when they were
      utilized and are amortizing the deferrals over the average lives of the related
      assets. See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding income
      taxes.

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

The
      provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is
      based
      upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and
      the
      FERC. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated
      assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP is
      deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "Regulatory
      and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance Sheet. See Note 5 for
      additional information.

Leases

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries apply the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases,"
      as
      amended and interpreted, to all transactions that qualify for lease accounting.
      See Note 10 for a discussion of accounting for leases under which PPL, PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric are lessees.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      2002,
      PPL began commercial operation of its 79.9 MW oil-powered station in Shoreham,
      New York. The Long Island Power Authority has contracted to purchase all of
      the
      plant's capacity and ancillary services as part of a 15-year power purchase
      agreement with PPL EnergyPlus. The capacity payments in the power purchase
      agreement result in the plant being classified as a direct-financing lease,
      under which PPL EnergyPlus is the lessor.

In
      December 2004, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a sales-type lease related
      to
      an 8 MW on-site electrical generation plant, under which a subsidiary of PPL
      Energy Supply is the lessor.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, PPL and PPL Energy Supply had receivable balances
      of
      $256 million and $273 million (included in "Current Assets - Other" and
      "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL and "Current Assets
      -
      Other" and "Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL Energy Supply) and unearned
      revenue balances of $143 million and $158 million (included in "Deferred Credits
      and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other"). The receivable balances include
      $65
      million of an unguaranteed residual value. Rental income received during 2005,
      2004 and 2003 was $15 million, $14 million and $15 million. Total future minimum
      lease payments expected to be received on both leases are estimated at $16
      million for each of the years from 2006 through 2010.

Fuel,
      Materials and Supplies

(PPL)

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries value inventory at the lower of cost or market, primarily
      using
      the average-cost method. At December 31, 2005, PPL Gas Utilities valued all
      of its natural gas inventory using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). The
      carrying value of that inventory was $16 million and $5 million at December
      31,
      2005 and 2004, and the excess of replacement cost over carrying value was $15
      million and $7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

(PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Fuel,
      materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
      average-cost method.

Guarantees

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      accordance with the provisions of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
      Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
      of
      Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission
      of FASB Interpretation No. 34," the fair values of guarantees related to
      arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2003, as well as guarantees
      excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45,
      are
      not recorded in the financial statements. See Note 14 for further discussion
      of
      recorded and unrecorded guarantees.

Treasury
      Stock

(

PPL
      and PPL Electric)

Treasury
      shares are reflected on the balance sheet as an offset to common equity under
      the cost method of accounting. Management has no definitive plans for the future
      use of these shares. Treasury shares are not considered outstanding in
      calculating EPS.

At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, PPL held 62,113,489 and 62,091,706 shares of
      treasury stock. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, PPL Electric held 79,270,519
      shares of treasury stock.

Foreign
      Currency Translation and Transactions

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Assets
      and liabilities of international operations, where the local currency is the
      functional currency, are translated at year-end exchange rates, and related
      revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during
      the year. Adjustments resulting from translation are recorded in accumulated
      other comprehensive loss.

Gains
      or
      losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in
      income. The aggregate transaction losses were insignificant in 2005, 2004 and
      2003.

New
      Accounting Standards

Segment
      and Related Information

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL's
      reportable segments are Supply, International Delivery (formerly International)
      and Pennsylvania Delivery (formerly Delivery). In 2005, there were no changes
      to
      the reportable segments except that the segments were renamed to more
      specifically describe their businesses. The Supply segment primarily consists
      of
      the domestic energy marketing, domestic generation and domestic development
      operations of PPL Energy Supply. The International Delivery segment includes
      operations of the international energy businesses of PPL Global that are
      primarily focused on the distribution of electricity. The majority of PPL
      Global's international businesses are located in the U.K., Chile, El Salvador
      and Bolivia. The Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric
      and gas delivery operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.

PPL
      Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International Delivery.
      The
      International Delivery segment at the PPL Energy Supply level is consistent
      with
      the International Delivery segment at the PPL level. The Supply segment
      information reported at the PPL Energy Supply level will not agree with the
      Supply segment information reported at the PPL level. Additional Supply segment
      functions, including telecommunications and acquisition, divestiture and
      development activities, exist at PPL that are outside of PPL Energy Supply.
      Furthermore, certain income items, including PLR revenue and certain interest
      income, exist at the PPL Energy Supply level, but are eliminated in
      consolidation at the PPL level. Finally, certain expense items are fully
      allocated to the segments at the PPL level only.

Segments
      include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate costs,
      for services provided by PPL Services. These service costs include functions
      such as financial, legal, human resources and information services.

Financial
      data for the segments are:

Investment
      in Unconsolidated Affiliates - at Equity

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Investment
      in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method at December
      31 (equity ownership percentages as of December 31, 2005) was:

In
      January 2006, PPL Global entered into an agreement to sell its minority interest
      in Aguaytia Energy, LLC.

A
      PPL
      Energy Supply subsidiary has a 50% interest in a partnership that owns the
      Griffith gas-fired generation station. The partnership arrangement is
      essentially a cost-sharing arrangement, in that each of the partners has rights
      to one-half of the plant capacity and energy, and an obligation to cover
      one-half of the operating costs of the station. Accordingly, the equity
      investment is not reflected in the table above and is classified as "Electric
      plant in service - Generation" on the Balance Sheet.

Earnings

Per Share

(PPL)

In
      August
      2005, PPL completed a 2-for-1 split of its common stock. The record date for
      the
      stock split was August 17, 2005, and the distribution date was
      August 24, 2005. As a result of the stock split, approximately 190 million
      shares were issued to shareholders, and approximately 31 million shares were
      issued as treasury shares as of the record date. The par value of the stock
      remains at $0.01 per share and, accordingly, $2 million was transferred from
      "Capital in excess of par value" to "Common stock" on the Balance Sheet. The
      number of shares, the market price, and earnings and dividends per share
      amounts, as well as PPL's stock-based compensation awards, the conversion rate
      and market price trigger of PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes
      due 2023 and the threshold appreciation price and shares issued under the PEPS
      Units transaction, included in these financial statements have been adjusted
      for
      all periods presented to reflect the stock split.

Basic
      EPS
      is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
      during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated using weighted average shares
      outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding
      if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock. Potentially
      dilutive securities consist of:

The
      basic
      and diluted EPS calculations, and the reconciliation of the shares (in
      thousands) used in the calculations, are:

In
      May
      2001, PPL and PPL Capital Funding Trust I issued 23 million PEPS Units that
      contained a purchase contract component for PPL's common stock. The purchase
      contracts were only dilutive if the average price of PPL's common stock exceeded
      a threshold appreciation price, which was adjusted for cash distributions on
      PPL
      common stock. The threshold appreciation price was initially set at $32.52
      and
      was adjusted to $31.69 as of April 1, 2004, based on dividends paid on PPL's
      common stock since issuance. The purchase contracts were settled in May 2004.
      Since the average price did not exceed the threshold appreciation price, the
      purchase contracts were excluded from the diluted EPS calculations for 2004
      and
      2003.

In
      January 2004, PPL completed an exchange offer resulting in the exchange of
      approximately four million PEPS Units for PEPS Units, Series B. The primary
      difference in the units related to the debt component. The purchase contract
      components of both units, which were potentially dilutive, were identical.
      The
      threshold appreciation price for the purchase contract component of the PEPS
      Units, Series B was adjusted in the same manner as that of the PEPS Units and
      was $31.69 as a result of the adjustment as of April 1, 2004. These purchase
      contracts were settled in May 2004. Since the average price did not exceed
      the
      threshold appreciation price, the purchase contracts were excluded from the
      diluted EPS calculations for 2004.

In
      May
      2003, PPL Energy Supply issued $400 million of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes
      due 2023. The notes are guaranteed by PPL and, as originally issued, could
      be
      converted into shares of PPL common stock if:

The
      conversion rate is 40.2212 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes. It
      will
      be adjusted if certain specified distributions, whether in the form of cash,
      stock, other equity interests, evidence of indebtedness or assets, are made
      to
      holders of PPL common stock. Additionally, the conversion rate can be increased
      by PPL if its Board of Directors has made a determination that to do so would
      be
      in the best interests of either PPL or holders of PPL common stock.

Depending
      upon which of the conversion events identified above occurs, the Convertible
      Senior Notes, as originally issued, could have been settled in cash or shares.
      However, the notes were modified in November 2004 to require cash settlement
      of
      the principal amount, permit settlement of any conversion premium in cash or
      stock and eliminate a provision that required settlement in stock in the event
      of default. These modifications were made in response to the FASB's ratification
      of EITF Issue 04-8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
      Diluted Earnings per Share," as well as other anticipated rules relating to
      EPS.
      EITF Issue 04-8 requires contingently convertible instruments to be included
      in
      diluted EPS. It also requires restatement of prior-period diluted EPS, in
      certain circumstances, based upon the terms of the contingently convertible
      instruments as of the date of adoption, which was December 31, 2004, for
      PPL.

The
      Convertible Senior Notes have a dilutive impact when the average market price
      of
      PPL common stock exceeds the conversion price of $24.87. The Convertible Senior
      Notes did not have a dilutive impact on EPS for 2003.

The
      maximum number of shares that could potentially be issued to settle the
      conversion premium, based upon the current conversion rate, is 16,088,480
      shares. Based on PPL's common stock price at December 31, 2005, the conversion
      premium equated to 2,483,038 shares, or approximately $73 million.

See
      Note
      8 for discussion of attainment of the market price trigger related to the
      Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2005 and the related conversion
      requests that PPL received in the fourth quarter.

The
      following number of stock options to purchase PPL common shares were excluded
      in
      the periods' computations of diluted EPS because the effect would have been
      antidilutive.

Income
      and Other Taxes

For
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, the statutory U.S. corporate federal income tax rate was 35%.
      The
      statutory corporate net income tax rate for Pennsylvania was 9.99%.

(PPL)

"Income
      from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Minority Interest and
      Distributions on Preferred Securities" included the following components for
      the
      years ended December 31.

Deferred
      income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
      carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
      basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and
      tax
      credit carryforwards.

Net
      deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of
      future taxable income for U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which PPL's
      operations have historically been profitable.

Significant
      components of PPL's deferred income tax assets and liabilities from continuing
      operations were:

Details
      of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income
      taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to income from continuing
      operations for accounting purposes, and details of taxes other than income
      are:

(a)

Excludes
                $6 million of deferred federal, state and foreign tax benefit in
                2005 and
                $26 million of current and deferred federal and state tax expense
                in 2003
                related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles,
                recorded net of tax. Excludes current and deferred federal and state
                tax
                benefits of $28 million in 2005, $8 million in 2004 and $10 million
                in
                2003 related to loss from discontinued operations, recorded net of
                tax.

In
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, PPL realized tax benefits related to stock-based compensation,
      recorded as an increase to capital in excess of par value of approximately
      $7
      million, $3 million and $5 million.

During
      2005, PPL recorded a $13 million benefit from the reduction of state and federal
      income taxes from filing the 2004 income tax returns. The $13 million benefit
      included in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of a $16 million
      federal benefit reflected in "Federal income tax return adjustments," offset
      by
      a $3 million state expense reflected in "State income taxes."

During
      2005, PPL recorded a $12 million benefit related to federal and state income
      tax
      reserve changes. The $12 million benefit included in the Reconciliation of
      Income Tax Expense consisted of a $7 million benefit reflected in "Stranded
      cost
      securitization," a $2 million state benefit reflected in "State income taxes"
      and a $3 million federal benefit reflected in "Other."

During
      2004, PPL recorded a $1 million benefit from the reduction of state and federal
      income taxes from filing the 2003 income tax returns. The $1 million benefit
      included in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of a $2 million
      federal benefit reflected in "Contribution of property" and a $1 million federal
      benefit reflected in "Federal income tax return adjustments," offset by a $2
      million state expense reflected in "State income taxes."

During
      2004, PPL recorded a $15 million benefit related to federal and state income
      tax
      reserve changes. The $15 million benefit included in the Reconciliation of
      Income Tax Expense consisted of a $22 million benefit reflected in "Stranded
      cost securitization" and a $2 million state benefit reflected in "State income
      taxes," offset by a $9 million federal expense reflected in
      "Other."

PPL
      had
      federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with an indefinite
      carryforward period of $111 million and $58 million at December 31, 2005 and
      2004. PPL also had state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between
      2006 and 2024 of approximately $97 million and $77 million at December 31,
      and 2004. Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more
      likely than not, will not be realized.

PPL
      Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $50 million
      and $27 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. PPL Global also had foreign
      capital loss carryforwards of $439 million and $486 million at December 31,
      2005 and 2004. All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward period.
      However, it is more likely than not that these losses will not be utilized
      and,
      as such, a full valuation allowance has been provided against the related
      deferred tax asset.

PPL
      Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings
      of
      its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings
      are
      permanently reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings are included
      in
      "Earnings reinvested" on the Balance Sheet. The amounts considered permanently
      reinvested at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $650 million and $406 million.
      If
      the earnings were remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional
      U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical to
      estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign
      earnings.

"Income
      From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Minority Interest and
      Distributions on Preferred Securities" included the following components for

Deferred
      income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
      carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
      basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and
      tax
      credit carryforwards.

Net
      deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of
      future taxable income for U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which PPL's
      operations have historically been profitable.

Significant
      components of PPL Energy Supply's deferred income tax assets and liabilities
      from continuing operations were:

Details
      of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income
      taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to income from continuing
      operations for accounting purposes, and details of taxes other than income
      are:

(a)

      compensation, recorded as an increase to member's equity of approximately $1
      million, $1 million and $2 million.

During
      2005, PPL Energy Supply recorded $3 million in state and federal income tax
      expense from filing the 2004 income tax returns. The $3 million tax expense
      included in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of a $25 million
      state expense reflected in "State income taxes," offset by a $22 million federal
      benefit reflected in "Federal income tax return adjustments."

During
      2005, PPL Energy Supply recorded an $8 million benefit related to federal income
      tax reserve changes. The $8 million benefit is included in "Other" in the
      Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense.

During
      2004, PPL Energy Supply recorded $9 million in state and federal income tax
      expense from filing the 2003 income tax returns. The $9 million tax expense
      included in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of an $18 million

      that expire between 2006 and 2024 of approximately $6 million and $4 million
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004. Valuation allowances have been established for
      the
      amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized.

PPL
      Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $50 million
      and $27 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. PPL Global also had foreign
      capital loss carryforwards of $439 million and $486 million at December 31,
      2005 and 2004. All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward period.
      However, it is more likely than not that these losses will not be utilized
      and,
      as such, a full valuation allowance has been provided against the related
      deferred tax asset.

PPL
      Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings
      of
      its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings
      are
      permanently reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings are included
      in
      "Member's Equity" on the Balance Sheet. The amounts considered permanently
      reinvested at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $650 million and $406 million.
      If
      the earnings were remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be subject to additional
      U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical to
      estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these foreign
      earnings.

The
      provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is
      based
      upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and
      the
      FERC. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated
      assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP is
      deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "Regulatory
      and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance Sheet.

The
      tax
      effects of significant temporary differences comprising PPL Electric's net
      deferred income tax liability were:

      are:

In
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, PPL Electric realized tax benefits related to stock-based
      compensation, recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital, which
      were
      insignificant.

During
      2005, PPL Electric recorded a $10 million benefit related to federal and state
      income tax reserve changes. The $10 million benefit included in the
      Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of a $7 million benefit reflected
      in "Stranded cost securitization," a $2 million state benefit reflected in
      "State income taxes" and a $1 million federal benefit reflected in
      "Other."

During
      2004, PPL Electric recorded a $20 million benefit related to federal and state
      income tax reserve changes. The $20 million benefit included in the
      Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense consisted of a $22 million benefit
      reflected in "Stranded cost securitization" and a $2 million state benefit
      reflected in "State income taxes," offset by a $4 million federal provision
      reflected in "Other."

PPL
      Electric had state net operating loss carryforwards that expire in 2024 of
      approximately $13 million at December 31, 2005. Valuation allowances have been
      established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be
      realized.

In
      October 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
      (the
      Act). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
      accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received
      deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During
      2005, PPL and PPL Energy Supply did not repatriate any foreign earned income
      subject to the Act.

The
      Act
      also provides, beginning in 2005, a tax deduction from income for certain
      qualified domestic production activities. FSP FAS 109-1, "Application of FASB
      Statement No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes,' to the Tax Deduction on
      Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
      of
      2004," specifies that this tax deduction will be treated as a special deduction
      and not as a tax rate reduction. For 2005, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recognized
      a $3 million tax benefit related to this new deduction. Additionally, as the
      Act
      specifically excludes the gross receipts from the transmission of electricity
      from the definition of qualifying domestic production gross receipts, PPL
      Electric will not receive a tax benefit from this new deduction.

Credit

Arrangements

and Financing Activities

Credit
      Arrangements

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide
      credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper program. At December
      31, 2005, no cash borrowings were outstanding under any PPL Electric credit
      facilities.

In
      June
      2005, PPL Electric extended to June 2010 its $200 million five-year facility
      originally set to expire in 2009. PPL Electric also maintains a $100 million
      three-year credit facility maturing in June 2006. PPL Electric has the ability
      to cause the lenders under its facilities to issue letters of credit. At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric had less than $1 million of letters of credit
      outstanding under its credit facilities.

PPL
      Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
      it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
      if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by certain
      credit agreements of PPL Electric. PPL Electric had no commercial paper
      outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

PPL
      Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
      PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
      receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary
      on
      an ongoing basis. The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans from
      a
      commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. PPL Electric
      uses
      the proceeds from the credit agreement for general corporate purposes and to
      cash collateralize letters of credit. The subsidiary's borrowing limit under
      this credit agreement is $150 million, and interest under the credit agreement
      varies based on the commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue commercial
      paper that supports the debt. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $131 million and
      $96 million of accounts receivable and $142 million and $128 million of unbilled
      revenue were pledged under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      there was $42 million of short-term debt outstanding under the credit agreement
      at an interest rate of 4.3% for 2005 and 2.33% for 2004, all of which was being
      used to cash collateralize letters of credit issued on PPL Electric's behalf.
      At
      December 31, 2005, based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue
      pledged, an additional $108 million was available for borrowing. The funds
      used
      to cash collateralize the letters of credit are reported in "Restricted cash"
      on
      the Balance Sheet. PPL Electric's sale to its subsidiary of the accounts
      receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute sale of the assets, and PPL
      Electric does not retain an interest in these assets. However, for financial
      reporting purposes, the subsidiary's financial results are consolidated in
      PPL
      Electric's financial statements. PPL Electric performs certain record-keeping
      and cash collection functions with respect to the assets in return for a
      servicing fee from the subsidiary. PPL Electric currently expects the subsidiary
      to renew the credit agreement on an annual basis.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Energy Supply maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and
      provide credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper program.
      PPL
      Energy Supply increased its facility capacity in 2005 in order to provide more
      liquidity capacity.

In
      March
      2005, PPL Energy Supply entered into a 364-day reimbursement agreement with
      a
      bank for the purpose of issuing letters of credit. Under the agreement, PPL
      Energy Supply can cause the bank to issue up to $200 million of letters of
      credit. At December 31, 2005, there were $199 million of letters of credit
      and
      no cash borrowings outstanding under this agreement.

In
      June
      2005, PPL Energy Supply extended to June 2010 its $800 million five-year
      facility originally set to expire in 2009 and entered into a new $600 million
      five-year credit facility expiring in June 2010, which replaced its $300 million
      three-year facility due to expire in 2006. PPL Energy Supply has the ability
      to
      cause the lenders under these facilities to issue letters of credit. At December
      31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply had $172 million of letters of credit and no cash
      borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.

In
      December 2005, PPL Energy Supply entered into a new $500 million five-year
      credit facility expiring in December 2010. The credit agreement allows for
      cash
      borrowings and issuances of letters of credit. PPL Energy Supply expects that
      this facility will be used primarily as a commercial paper backstop and for
      issuing letters of credit to satisfy collateral requirements of PPL Energy
      Supply's affiliates. At December 31, 2005, no cash borrowings or letters of
      credit were outstanding under this facility.

Also,
      in
      December 2005, PPL Energy Supply entered into a new $300 million five-year
      letter of credit and revolving credit facility expiring in March 2011. The
      credit agreement allows for cash borrowings and issuances of letters of credit.
      PPL Energy Supply expects that this facility will be used primarily for issuing
      letters of credit to satisfy collateral requirements of PPL Energy Supply's
      affiliates. At December 31, 2005, there were no cash borrowings and $286 million
      of letters of credit outstanding under this facility. PPL Energy Supply's
      obligations under this facility are supported by a $300 million letter of credit
      issued on PPL Energy Supply's behalf under a separate $300 million five-year
      letter of credit and reimbursement agreement also expiring in March
      2011.

PPL
      Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million to
      provide it with an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity
      needs, if and when necessary. Commercial paper issuances are supported by
      certain credit arrangements of PPL Energy Supply. PPL Energy Supply had $100
      million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 with a
      weighted-average interest rate of 4.51% and no commercial paper outstanding
      at
      December 31, 2004.

WPD
      (South West) maintains three committed credit facilities: a £100 million 364-day
      facility, a £150 million three-year facility and a £150 million five-year
      facility. In October 2005, WPD (South West) extended the £100 million 364-day
      facility until October 2006 and the £150 million three-year facility until
      October 2008. The £150 million five-year facility expires in October 2009. At
      December 31, 2005, WPD (South West) also has uncommitted credit facilities
      of
£65 million. The balance outstanding under the WPD (South West) credit
      facilities at December 31, 2005, was £41 million (approximately $71 million
      at current exchange rates) with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.98% .

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      2001,
      PPL Electric completed a strategic initiative to confirm its legal separation
      from PPL and PPL's other affiliated companies. This initiative was designed
      to
      enable PPL Electric to substantially reduce its exposure to volatility in energy
      prices and supply risks through 2009 and to reduce its business and financial
      risk profile by, among other things, limiting its business activities to the
      transmission and distribution of electricity and businesses related to or
      arising out of the electric transmission and distribution businesses.

In
      connection with this initiative, PPL Electric:

The
      enhancements to PPL Electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended
      to minimize the risk that a court would order PPL Electric's assets and
      liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of PPL or another
      affiliate of PPL in the event that PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become
      a
      debtor in a bankruptcy case. Based on these various measures, PPL Electric
      was
      able to issue and maintain a higher level of debt and use it to replace higher
      cost equity, thereby maintaining a lower total cost of capital. Nevertheless,
      if
      PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case,
      there
      can be no assurance that a court would not order PPL Electric's assets and
      liabilities to be consolidated with those of PPL or such other PPL
      affiliate.

The
      subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities. PPL's subsidiaries are not
      liable for the debts of PPL. Accordingly, creditors of PPL may not satisfy
      their
      debts from the assets of the subsidiaries absent a specific contractual
      undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as required by applicable
      law or regulation. Similarly, absent a specific contractual undertaking or
      as
      required by applicable law or regulation, PPL is not liable for the debts of
      its
      subsidiaries. Accordingly, creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy
      their
      debts from the assets of PPL absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL
      to
      pay the creditors of its subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or
      regulation.

Similarly,
      the subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are separate legal
      entities. These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL Energy Supply
      and PPL Electric. Accordingly, creditors of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
      may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their subsidiaries absent a
      specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay the creditors or as
      required by applicable law or regulation. In addition, absent a specific
      contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation, PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric are not liable for the debts of their
      subsidiaries. Accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy
      their
      debts from the assets of PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric absent a specific
      contractual undertaking by that parent to pay the creditors of its subsidiaries
      or as required by applicable law or regulation.

Financing
      Activities

(PPL)

In
      April
      2005, PPL Capital Funding retired all $320 million of its 7-3/4% Medium-term
      Notes due April 2005 upon maturity. The funds for the retirement were primarily
      obtained from PPL Energy Supply's August 2004 issuance of $300 million of 5.40%
      Senior Notes maturing in August 2014.

In
      July
      2005, PPL Capital Funding retired $142 million of its 7.29% Subordinated Notes
      due May 2006 at a market value of $145 million. PPL recorded a loss of $3
      million related to this transaction in 2005.

PPL
      Capital Funding retired all $10 million of its 6.17% Medium-term Notes due
      September 2005 and retired all $20 million of its 6.39% Medium-term Notes
      due October 2005 upon maturity.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      December 2004, WPD borrowed £108 million (approximately $208 million at December
      2004 exchange rates) under its credit facilities to retire $178 million of
      6.75%
      Unsecured Bonds due December 2004 and settle the related $30 million
      cross-currency swap. The total amount is included on the Statement of Cash
      Flows
      as "Retirement of long-term debt." This bond retirement was recorded in 2005,
      due to the one-month reporting lag.

In
      October 2005, PPL Energy Supply issued $300 million aggregate principal amount
      of 5.70% REset Put Securities due 2035 (REPS

SM

).
      The
      REPS bear interest at a rate of 5.70% per annum to, but excluding, October
      15,
      2015 (Remarketing Date). The REPS are required to be put by existing holders
      on
      the Remarketing Date either for (a) purchase and remarketing by a designated
      remarketing dealer, or (b) repurchase by PPL Energy Supply. If the remarketing
      dealer elects to purchase the REPS for remarketing, it will purchase the REPS
      at
      100% of the principal amount, and the REPS will bear interest on and after
      the
      Remarketing Date at a new fixed rate per annum determined in the remarketing.
      PPL Energy Supply has the right to terminate the remarketing process. If the
      remarketing is terminated at the option of PPL Energy Supply, or under certain
      other circumstances, including the occurrence of an event of default by PPL
      Energy Supply under the related indenture or a failed remarketing for certain
      specified reasons, PPL Energy Supply will be required to pay the remarketing
      dealer a settlement amount. The settlement amount will be the present value
      of
      an annuity equal to the positive difference, if any, between (a) a stream of
      interest payments that would have been due on the REPS after the Remarketing
      Date, assuming the REPS were to bear interest at a rate based on the 20-year
      swap rate in effect on October 20, 2005, and (b) a stream of interest payments
      that would have been due on the REPS after the Remarketing Date, assuming the
      REPS were to bear interest at a rate based on the 20-year swap rate in effect
      on
      the date of calculation of the settlement amount. Also, if the remarketing
      is
      terminated for any reason, PPL Energy Supply must repurchase the entire
      principal amount of the REPS on the Remarketing Date at 100% of the principal
      amount. PPL Energy Supply received net proceeds of approximately $311 million
      from the issuance of the REPS, which includes a premium of approximately $13
      million, associated with the remarketing feature. These proceeds will be used
      by
      PPL Energy Supply's affiliates to repay indebtedness and by PPL Energy Supply
      for capital expenditures and/or general corporate purposes.

In
      November 2005, Emel entered into a contract that established the fixed terms
      under which Emel will borrow UF 2,535,000 (approximately $73 million at current
      exchange rates) in July 2006 to partially finance the UF 3 million bond maturity
      due August 1, 2006. Any borrowing will be recorded when drawn.

The
      terms
      of PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 include a market
      price trigger that permits holders to convert the notes during any fiscal
      quarter if the closing sale price of PPL's common stock exceeds $29.83 for
      at
      least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
      trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. This market price trigger was
      met
      in the third quarter of 2005. Therefore, holders of the Convertible Senior
      Notes
      were entitled to convert their notes at any time during the fourth quarter
      of
      2005. As discussed in Note 4, when holders elect to convert the Convertible
      Senior Notes, PPL Energy Supply is required to settle the principal amount
      in
      cash and any conversion premium in cash or PPL common stock. In December 2005,
      an insignificant amount of bonds was presented for conversion and settled in
      January 2006 with the issuance of PPL common stock and the payment by PPL Energy
      Supply of an insignificant amount of cash. As a result of the market price
      trigger being met in the third quarter, PPL Energy Supply wrote-off $6 million
      of unamortized debt issuance costs during 2005, which is included in "Interest
      Expense" on the Statement of Income. The market price trigger was not met in
      the
      fourth quarter of 2005.

In
      2005,
      PPL Energy Supply repaid its $495 million note payable to an affiliate. PPL
      Energy Supply may still reborrow up to $650 million under the note until
      maturity of the note in May 2006, with interest payable monthly in arrears
      at
      LIBOR plus 1%.

During
      2005, PPL Energy Supply distributed $278 million to its parent company and
      received capital contributions of $50 million.

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

In
      February 2005, the Lehigh County Industrial Development Authority (LCIDA) issued
      $116 million of 4.70% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2029 on
      behalf of PPL Electric. The proceeds of the LCIDA bonds were used in March
      to refund the LCIDA's $116 million of 6.40% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding
      Bonds due 2029, previously issued on behalf of PPL Electric. A $2 million
      premium was paid to redeem these bonds.

In
      May
      2005, the LCIDA issued $108 million of 4.75% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding
      Bonds due 2027 on behalf of PPL Electric. The proceeds of these LCIDA bonds
      were
      used in June 2005 to refund the LCIDA's $53 million of 5.50% Pollution Control
      Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2027 and in August 2005 to refund the LCIDA's $55
      million of 6.15% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2029, previously
      issued on behalf of PPL Electric. A $1 million premium was paid as part of
      each
      bond redemption.

In
      connection with the issuance of each of these new series of LCIDA bonds, PPL
      Electric

entered
      into a loan agreement with the LCIDA pursuant to which the LCIDA has loaned
      to
      PPL Electric the proceeds of the LCIDA bonds on payment terms that correspond
      to
      the LCIDA bonds. The scheduled principal and interest payments

on
      the
      LCIDA bonds are insured. In order to secure its obligations to the insurance
      provider, PPL Electric issued $224 million aggregate principal amount of its
      Senior Secured Bonds (under its 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture), which
      also
      have payment terms that correspond to the LCIDA bonds.

In
      April
      2005, PPL Electric retired all $69 million of its 6-1/2% First Mortgage Bonds
      due April 2005 upon maturity.

In
      December 2005, PPL Electric sold $200 million of Senior Secured Bonds to certain
      institutional buyers in a private placement. The bonds were issued in two
      tranches: $100 million of bonds maturing in December 2015 with a coupon of
      4.95%, and $100 million of bonds maturing in December 2020 with a coupon of
      5.15%. PPL Electric will use the proceeds from the bonds to refund maturing
      First Mortgage Bonds.

During
      2005, PPL Transition Bond Company made principal payments on transition bonds
      of
      $266 million.

During
      2005, PPL Electric paid common dividends of $93 million to PPL.

Dividends
      and Dividend Restrictions

(PPL)

There
      were two common stock dividend increases in 2005. In February 2005, PPL
      announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend to 23 cents
      per share (equivalent to $0.92 per annum) and in August 2005, PPL announced
      an
      increase, effective October 1, 2005, to 25 cents per share (equivalent
      to $1.00 per annum). In February 2006, PPL announced an increase to its
      quarterly common stock dividend, payable April 1, 2006, to 27.5 cents per share
      (equivalent to $1.10 per annum). Future dividends, declared at the discretion
      of
      the Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows,
      financial requirements and other factors.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      PPL
      Montana Colstrip lease places certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability
      to
      declare dividends. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not
      limit PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's ability to operate as desired and will not
      affect their ability to meet any of their cash obligations. Certain of PPL
      Global's international subsidiaries also have financing arrangements which
      limit
      their ability to pay dividends. However, PPL does not, at this time, expect
      that
      any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's
      ability to meet their cash obligations.

(PPL
      and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments in
      the
      event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to
      comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation
      and
      Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other subsidiaries.
      PPL
      Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would
      significantly impact its ability to declare dividends.

Mandatorily
      Redeemable Securities

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On
      July
      1, 2003, PPL adopted the provisions of SFAS 150, "Accounting for Certain
      Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity."
      As a
      result, PPL changed its classification of the trust preferred securities of
      PPL
      Capital Funding Trust I, which were issued as a component of the PEPS Units,
      PPL
      Energy Supply changed its classification of the trust preferred securities
      issued by SIUK Capital Trust I and PPL Electric changed its classification
      of
      its preferred stock with sinking fund requirements. Under SFAS 150, these
      securities were required to be classified as liabilities instead of "mezzanine"
      equity on the balance sheet because they were considered mandatorily redeemable
      securities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, no amounts were included in
      long-term debt for any of these securities because of the following: PPL
      deconsolidated PPL Capital Funding Trust I in accordance with FASB
      Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
      Interpretation of ARB No. 51," effective December 31, 2003, and terminated
      the
      trust in 2004; PPL Energy Supply deconsolidated SIUK Capital Trust I in
      accordance with FIN 46, effective December 31, 2003; and there was no preferred
      stock with sinking fund requirements of PPL Electric outstanding (due to
      preferred stock redemptions). See Note 22 for a discussion of the
      deconsolidation of the trusts. As a result of the deconsolidation and continued
      existence of SIUK Capital Trust I, the subordinated debt securities that support
      the SIUK Capital Trust I preferred securities, rather than the trust preferred
      securities themselves, are reflected in long-term debt as of December 31, 2005
      and 2004.

SFAS
      also required the distributions on these mandatorily redeemable securities
      to be
      included as a component of "Interest Expense" instead of "Distributions on
      Preferred Securities" in the Statement of Income, effective July 1, 2003.
      "Interest Expense" for 2003 includes distributions on these securities totaling
      $27 million for PPL, $5 million for PPL Energy Supply and an insignificant
      amount for PPL Electric. "Distributions on Preferred Securities" for 2003
      includes distributions on these securities totaling $27 million for PPL, $5
      million for PPL Energy Supply and $1 million for PPL Electric. As a result
      of
      the adoption of FIN 46 by PPL and PPL Energy Supply and the redemption of the
      preferred stock with sinking fund requirements by PPL Electric, no amounts
      are
      reflected in "Interest Expense" for these mandatorily redeemable securities
      in
      2005 and 2004.

Acquisitions,
      Development and Divestitures

From
      time
      to time, PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third
      parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets, joint
      ventures and development projects. Any such transactions may impact future
      financial results.

Domestic
      Generation Projects

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      January 2003, PPL announced that it had decided not to proceed with development
      of a 300 MW project at the Kings Park site on Long Island, New York. In March
      2003, PPL Global sold its interest in Kings Park Energy, LLC. At that time,
      six
      unassigned gas combustion turbine generators and other related equipment to
      be
      used at the Kings Park site were transferred to PPL Generation and retained
      as
      spare parts.

In
      November 2003, PPL Generation sold four of the six spare gas combustion turbine
      generators and related equipment for approximately $33 million. The pre-tax
      loss
      on the sale of approximately $3 million is included in "Other Income - net"
      on
      the Statement of Income in 2003. In 2004, a subsidiary of PPL Generation sold
      the remaining two spare gas combustion turbine generators and related equipment
      for approximately $18 million. The net loss from these two sales was
      insignificant.

In
      2004,
      PPL Maine entered into an agreement with a coalition of government agencies
      and
      private groups to sell three of its nine hydroelectric dams in Maine. Under
      the
      agreement, a non-profit organization designated by the coalition would have
      a
      five-year option to purchase the dams for approximately $25 million, and PPL
      Maine would receive rights to increase energy output at its other hydroelectric
      dams in Maine. The coalition has announced plans to remove or bypass the dams
      subject to the agreement in order to restore runs of Atlantic salmon and other
      migratory fish to the Penobscot River. The agreement requires several approvals
      by the FERC. Certain of these regulatory approvals have been obtained, but
      PPL
      cannot predict whether or when all of them will be obtained.

International
      Energy Projects

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Sale
      of CEMAR

In
      June
      2002, PPL made a decision to exit its CEMAR investment after a series of
      impairment losses were recorded. At that time, PPL Global's remaining portion
      of
      its CEMAR investment was written-off.

In
      April
      2004, PPL Global transferred its interest in CEMAR to two companies controlled
      by a private equity fund managed by GP Investimentos, a Brazilian private equity
      firm. The sale resulted in a credit of approximately $23 million as a result
      of
      the reversal of the negative carrying value and the associated cumulative
      translation adjustment, which is included in "Other Income - net" on the
      Statement of Income.

Sale
      of CGE

In
      March
      2004, PPL Global completed the sale of its minority interest in shares of CGE
      for approximately $123 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax charge of
      approximately $15 million ($7 million after tax), which is included in operating
      expenses as "Energy-related businesses" on the Statement of Income. This charge
      was due to the write-off of the associated cumulative translation adjustment,
      primarily as a result of the devaluation of the Chilean peso since the original
      acquisition in 2000.

Other
      Sales

In
      2003,
      a subsidiary of WPD sold certain Hyder properties. PPL Global received
      approximately $17 million from the sales, and recorded a pre-tax gain of
      approximately $2 million. This gain is included in "Other Income - net" on
      the
      Statement of Income.

In
      January 2006, PPL Global executed an agreement for the sale of its minority
      interest in Aguaytia Energy, LLC, a combined generating and natural gas facility
      in Peru.

Discontinued
      Operations

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Sale
      of Sundance Plant

In
      May
      2005, a subsidiary of PPL Generation completed the sale of its 450 MW Sundance
      power plant located in Pinal County, Arizona, to Arizona Public Service Company
      for approximately $190 million in cash. Proceeds from the sale were used to
      reduce PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's outstanding debt and improve liquidity.
      The
      book value of the plant was approximately $260 million on the sale date. PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply recorded a loss on the sale in May 2005 of approximately
      $47
      million, or $0.12 per share for PPL, net of a tax benefit of $26 million. The
      loss on the sale is reflected as "Loss from Discontinued Operations," along
      with
      operating losses of the Sundance plant of $4 million, $13 million, and $14
      million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The 2003 operating loss excludes a charge of
      $9
      million due to a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle discussed
      in Note 22. At December 31, 2004, the Sundance plant had a book value of $263
      million, which was recorded in "Electric plant in service - Generation" on
      the
      Balance Sheet. The plant had been included in the total assets of the Supply
      segment prior to the sale.

Sale
      of Latin American Telecommunications Company

In
      December 2003, PPL Global's Board of Managers authorized PPL Global to sell
      its
      investment in a Latin American telecommunications company, and approved a plan
      of sale. It was determined that the viability of this non-strategic business
      was
      not economical. As a result, PPL Global recorded an $18 million write-down
      in
      the carrying value of the company's net assets to their estimated fair value
      of
      approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2003.

In
      June
      2004, PPL Global sold this investment to local management for a nominal amount.
      The operating results of the Latin American telecommunications company, which
      was a loss of approximately $2 million in 2004 and 2003, as well as the
      write-down of its net assets, which was an insignificant amount in 2004 and
      approximately $18 million in 2003, are reflected as "Loss from Discontinued
      Operations" on the Statement of Income.

Other

(PPL)

In
      2003,
      a subsidiary of PPL Telcom acquired the fiber optic network of a Fairfax,
      Virginia-based company for approximately $21 million, consisting of $9 million
      in cash and a $12 million capital lease obligation for the right to use portions
      of a fiber optic network. The 1,330-route-mile metropolitan area fiber network
      connects New York, northern New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington,
      D.C. The acquisition required certain regulatory approvals and authorizations
      in
      the area served by the network.

In
      June
      2004, a PPL subsidiary evaluated its investment in a technology supplier for
      impairment. As a result of the evaluation, the subsidiary recorded a pre-tax
      impairment charge of approximately $10 million ($6 million after tax), which
      is
      included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income.

Leases

Colstrip
      Generating Plant

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Montana leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest
      in
      Unit 3, under four 36-year non-cancelable operating leases. These leases provide
      two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets.
      PPL Montana is required to pay all expenses associated with the operations
      of
      the generation units. The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's
      ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends and require
      PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios related to cash flow and net
      worth. There are no residual value guarantees in these leases. However, upon
      an
      event of default or an event of loss, the lessee could be required to pay a
      termination value of amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts
      owing on the lessor notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment
      and anticipated return on investment. The events of default include payment
      defaults, breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other
      indebtedness of PPL Montana, change in control of PPL Montana and certain
      bankruptcy events. The termination value was estimated to be $637 million at
      December 31, 2005.

Other
      Leases

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries have leases for vehicles, office space, land, buildings,
      personal computers and other equipment. The following rental expense for all
      operating leases, including the Colstrip generating plant, was primarily
      included in "Operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income.

Total
      future minimum rental payments for all operating leases, including those with
      cancelable terms but covered by residual value guarantees, are estimated to
      be:

(PPL)

In
      connection with the acquisition of the fiber optic network discussed in Note
      9,
      a subsidiary of PPL Telcom assumed a capital lease obligation through 2020
      for
      the right to use portions of the fiber optic network. The balance outstanding
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $11 million. Total future minimum rental payments
      for this capital lease are estimated at $1 million for each of the years from
      2006 through 2010, and $12 million thereafter.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Under
      the
      PPL Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) and the Incentive Compensation Plan for
      Key Employees (ICPKE) (together, the Plans), restricted shares of PPL common
      stock, restricted stock units and stock options may be granted to officers
      and
      other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and other affiliated
      companies. Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation and Corporate
      Governance Committee (CCGC) of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of the
      ICP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council (CLC), in the case of the
      ICPKE. The ICP limits the total number of awards that may be granted under
      it
      after April 23, 1999, to 15,769,430 awards, or 5% of the total shares of
      common stock that were outstanding at April 23, 1999. The ICPKE limits the
      total
      number of awards that may be granted under it after April 25, 2003, to
      16,573,608 awards, or 5% of the total shares of common stock that were
      outstanding at January 1, 2003, reduced by outstanding awards for which common
      stock was not yet issued as of April 25, 2003. In addition, each Plan limits
      the
      number of shares available for awards in any calendar year to 2% of the
      outstanding common stock of PPL on the first day of such calendar year. The
      maximum number of options that can be awarded under each Plan to any single
      eligible employee in any calendar year is three million shares. Any portion
      of
      these options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any
      subsequent year. If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the
      participant terminate, the shares of common stock underlying such an award
      are
      again available for grant. Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form
      of authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL
      or
      common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in
      accordance with applicable securities laws.

Restricted
      Stock

Restricted
      shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend
      rights. Restricted stock awards are subject to a restriction or vesting period
      as determined by the CCGC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in the case of
      the
      ICPKE. In addition, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout
      under Plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of
      employees. Restricted shares vest fully if control of PPL changes, as defined
      by
      the plans.

Restricted
      Stock Units

The
      Plans
      allow for the grant of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are awards
      based on the fair market value of PPL common stock. Actual PPL common shares
      will be issued upon completion of a restriction or vesting period as determined
      by the CCGC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in the case of the ICPKE.
      Recipients of restricted stock units may also be granted the right to receive
      dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the
      award is forfeited. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or
      accelerated payout under the Plan provisions for termination, retirement,
      disability and death of employees. Restricted stock units vest fully if control
      of PPL changes, as defined by the Plans.

A
      summary
      of restricted stock/unit grants follows.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL had 417,740 restricted shares and 1,139,383 restricted
      units outstanding. These awards currently vest from three to 25 years from
      the
      date of grant.

Compensation
      expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards was $18
      million, $6 million and $5 million for PPL for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Compensation
      expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for PPL
      Energy Supply in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $13 million, $5 million and $4
      million.

Compensation
      expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for PPL
      Electric was $4 million for 2005 and $1 million for 2004 and 2003.

Compensation
      expense for 2005 included an adjustment to record accelerated recognition of
      expense for employees at or near retirement age. See Note 1 for additional
      details.

Stock
      Options

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Under
      the
      Plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per
      share
      not less than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant.
      The options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming
      the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary, in installments as
      determined by the CCGC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in the case of the
      ICPKE. Options outstanding at December 31, 2005, become exercisable over a
      three-year period from the date of grant in equal installments. The CCGC and
      CLC
      have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options, except that
      the
      exercisability of an option issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless
      the individual remains employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the
      date of grant. All options expire no later than ten years from the grant date.
      The options become exercisable immediately if control of PPL changes, as defined
      by the Plans.

PPL
      recorded compensation expense related to stock options of $12 million, $6
      million and $3 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

PPL
      Energy Supply recorded compensation expense related to stock options of $8
      million, $4 million and $2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

PPL
      Electric recorded compensation expense related to stock options of $3 million,
      $2 million and $1 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Compensation
      expense for 2005 included an adjustment to record accelerated recognition of
      expense for employees at or near retirement age. See Note 1 for additional
      details.

A
      summary
      of stock option activity follows.

The
      estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes
      option-pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used in the model were:

Directors
      Stock Units

(PPL)

Under
      the
      Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, stock units are used to compensate members
      of PPL's Board of Directors who are not employees of PPL. Such stock units
      represent shares of PPL's common stock to which board members are entitled
      after
      they cease serving as a member of the Board of Directors. Board members are
      also
      entitled to defer any or all of their cash compensation into stock units. The
      stock unit accounts of each board member are increased based on dividends paid
      or other distributions on PPL's common stock. There were 273,775 stock units
      outstanding at December 31, 2005. Compensation expense was $2 million for 2005
      and insignificant for 2004 and 2003.

Stock
      Appreciation Rights

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

WPD
      uses
      stock appreciation rights to compensate senior management employees. Stock
      appreciation rights are granted with a reference price to PPL's common stock
      at
      the date of grant. These awards vest over a three-year period and have a 10-year
      term, during which time employees are entitled to receive a cash payment of
      any
      appreciation in the price of PPL's common stock over the grant date value.
      At
      December 31, 2005, there were 294,060 stock appreciation rights outstanding.
      Compensation expense for all periods reported was insignificant.

Retirement
      and Postemployment Benefits

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefits

PPL
      and
      certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
      and
      postemployment benefit plans. PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers'
      Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
      Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS 112, "Employers
      Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," when accounting for these
      benefits.

The
      majority of PPL's domestic employees are eligible for pension benefits under
      non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length
      of
      service and final average pay, as defined by the plans. Employees of PPL Montana
      are eligible for pension benefits under a cash balance pension plan and
      employees of certain of PPL's mechanical contracting companies are eligible
      for
      benefits under multi-employer plans sponsored by various unions. The employees
      of PPL's U.K. subsidiary, WPD, are eligible for benefits from one pension scheme
      with benefits based on length of service and final average pay. Retirees of
      PPL's Latin American subsidiaries may be eligible for coverage under
      government-sponsored and administered programs.

PPL
      and
      certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to
      directors, executives and other key management employees through unfunded
      nonqualified retirement plans.

The
      majority of employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries will become eligible for
      certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through
      contributory plans. Postretirement benefits under the PPL Retiree Health Plan
      and PPL Gas Retiree Health Plan are paid from funded VEBA trusts sponsored
      by
      the respective companies. Postretirement benefits under the PPL Montana Retiree
      Health Plan are paid from company assets.

The
      following disclosures distinguish between PPL's domestic and international
      pension plans.

PPL
      uses
      a December 31 measurement date for its domestic pension and other postretirement
      benefit plans and its international pension plans.

Net
      periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (credits)
      were:

(a)

The
                $9 million cost of special termination benefits for 2003 was the
                final
                cost recorded to complete PPL's 2002 workforce reduction program.
                See Note
                20 for additional information.

The
                $5 million cost of special termination benefits for 2005 was related
                to
                the WPD approved staff reduction plan as a result of the merger of
                its two
                control rooms, metering reorganization and other staff efficiencies.
                Additional pension costs were recognized due to early retirement
                and
                pension enhancement provisions granted to the
                employees.

Net
      periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs charged (credited)
      to
      operating expense, excluding amounts charged to construction and other
      non-expense accounts, were:

(a)

The
                domestic amount for 2003 excludes the $9 million cost of special
                termination benefits, which are included separately on the Statement
                of
                Income, within the "Workforce reduction" charge for that
                year.

(b)

In
                addition to the specific plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL
                Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus are also allocated a portion
                of
                the costs of pension plans sponsored by PPL Services, included in
                the PPL
                total cost above, based on their participation in those
                plans.

(c)

PPL
                Electric is also allocated a portion of the costs of pension plans
                sponsored by PPL Services, included in the PPL total cost above,
                based on
                participation in those plans.

The
      following assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations
      at
      December 31 and determination of net periodic benefit cost for the years ended
      December 31.

(a)

The
                expected return on plan assets for PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's
                Domestic
                Pension Plans includes a 25 basis point reduction for management
                fees.

A
      one-percentage point change in the assumed health care costs trend rate
      assumption would have the following effects in 2005.

The
      expected long-term rate of return for PPL's domestic pension plans considers
      the
      plans' historical experience, but is primarily based on the plans' mix of assets
      and expectations for long-term returns of those asset classes

.

(PPL)

The
      expected long-term rate of return for PPL's other postretirement benefit plans
      is based on

the
      VEBA
      trusts' mix of assets and expectations for long-term returns of those asset
      classes considering that a portion of those assets are taxable

.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      expected rate of return for PPL's international pension plans considers that
      a
      portfolio largely invested in equities would be expected to achieve an average
      rate of return in excess of a portfolio largely invested in long-term bonds.
      The
      historical experience has been an excess return of 2% to 4% per annum on average
      over the return on long-term bonds.

(PPL)

The
      funded status of the PPL plans was as follows.

Information
      for pension plans with projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess
      of plan assets follows.

Other
      postretirement benefit plans with accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
      in excess of plan assets had accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
      and
      fair value of assets of $518 million and $258 million at December 31, 2005,
      and
      $485 million and $249 million at December 31, 2004.

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

The
      funded status of the PPL Energy Supply plans was as follows.

Information
      for pension plans with projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess
      of plan assets follows.

Other
      postretirement benefit plans with accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
      in excess of plan assets had accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
      and
      fair value of assets of $14 million and none at December 31, 2005, and $12
      million and none at December 31, 2004.

In
      addition to the plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Generation
      subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus are allocated a portion of the liabilities
      and
      costs of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PPL
      Services based on their participation in those plans. The pension liabilities
      assumed by PPL Energy Supply for these plans were $60 million at December 31,
      2005 and 2004. The prepaid other postretirement benefit costs assumed by PPL
      Energy Supply for these plans were $1 million and $2 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004.

PPL
      Energy Supply subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business make
      contributions to various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans,
      depending on an employee's status. Contributions of $37 million, $28 million
      and
      $23 million were made in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The change in contributions from
      year to year was primarily the result of the changes in the workforce at the
      mechanical contracting companies. The contribution rates have also increased
      from year to year.

(PPL
      Electric)

Although
      PPL Electric does not directly sponsor any pension or other postretirement
      benefit plans, it is allocated a portion of the liabilities and costs of plans
      sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those plans. At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the recorded balance of PPL Electric's
      allocated share of the total pension liability was $77 million and $76 million.
      At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the balance in PPL Electric's allocated share
      of
      the total prepaid other postretirement benefit cost was $2 million and $4
      million.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric had a regulatory asset of $4 million relating
      to
      postretirement benefits, which is being amortized and recovered in rates, with
      a
      remaining life of seven years. PPL Electric also maintains an additional
      liability for the cost of health care of retired miners of former subsidiaries
      that had been engaged in coal mining. At December 31, 2005, the liability was
      $35 million. The liability is the net of $62 million of estimated future benefit
      payments offset by $27 million of available assets in a PPL Electric-funded
      VEBA
      trust.

Plan
      Assets - Domestic Pension Plans

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      asset
      allocation for the PPL Retirement Plan Master Trust and the target allocation,
      by asset category, is detailed below.

The
      domestic pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers and
      are
      rebalanced as necessary to maintain the target asset allocation ranges. PPL's
      investment strategy with respect to the domestic pension assets is to achieve
      a
      satisfactory risk-adjusted return on assets that, in combination with PPL's
      funding policy and tolerance for return volatility, will ensure that sufficient
      dollars are available to provide benefit payments.

Plan
      Assets - Domestic Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

(PPL)

The
      asset
      allocation for the PPL other postretirement benefit plans by asset category
      is
      detailed below.

PPL's
      investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations
      is to fund the VEBA trusts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a
      tax
      efficient manner utilizing a prudent mix of assets. Based on the current VEBA
      and postretirement plan structure, a targeted asset allocation range of 50%
      to
      60% equity and 40% to 50% debt is maintained.

Plan
      Assets - International Pension Plans

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

WPD
      operates three defined benefit plans, the WPD Group segment of the Electricity
      Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), the Western Power Utilities Pension Scheme and
      the
      Infralec 1992 Scheme. The assets of all three schemes are held separately from
      those of WPD in trustee-administered funds.

PPL's
      international pension plan asset allocation and target allocation is detailed
      below.

In
      consultation with its investment advisor and with WPD, the group trustees of
      the
      WPD Group of the ESPS have drawn up a Statement of Investment Principles to
      comply with the requirements of U.K. legislation.

The
      group
      trustees' primary investment objective is to maximize investment returns within
      the constraint of avoiding excessive volatility in the funding
      position.

Expected
      Cash Flows - Domestic Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
      Plans

(PPL)

There
      are
      no contributions required for PPL's primary domestic pension plan or any of
      PPL's other domestic subsidiary pension plans. However, PPL's domestic
      subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $37 million to their pension
      plans in 2006 to ensure future compliance with minimum funding
      requirements.

PPL
      sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets
      are segregated from corporate assets. PPL expects to make approximately $2
      million of benefit payments under these plans in 2006.

PPL
      is
      not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans
      but
      has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement
      benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would provide
      for
      PPL to contribute $39 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
      2006.

The
      following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
      appropriate, are expected to be paid and the following federal subsidy payments
      are expected to be received by the separate plan trusts.

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

There
      are
      no contributions required for the PPL Montana pension plan. However, PPL Montana
      expects to contribute approximately $11 million to the plan in 2006 to ensure
      future compliance with minimum funding requirements.

The
      following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
      appropriate, are expected to be paid by the separate plan trusts.

Expected
      Cash Flows - International Pension Plans

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      pension plans of WPD are subject to formal actuarial valuations every three
      years, which are used to determine funding requirements. Future contributions
      were evaluated in accordance with the latest valuation performed as of
      March 31, 2004, in respect of WPD's principal pension scheme, the ESPS, to
      determine contribution requirements for 2005 and forward. WPD expects to make
      contributions of approximately $47 million in 2006.

The
      following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
      appropriate, are expected to be paid by the separate plan trusts.

Savings
      Plans

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Substantially
      all employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
      deferred savings plans (401(k)s). Contributions to the plans charged to
      operating expense approximated the following.

Employee
      Stock Ownership Plan

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      sponsors a non-leveraged ESOP, in which substantially all employees, excluding
      those of PPL Global, PPL Montana, PPL Gas Utilities and the mechanical
      contractors, are enrolled after one year of credited service. Dividends paid
      on
      ESOP shares are treated as ordinary dividends by PPL. Under existing income
      tax
      laws, PPL is permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax
      purposes and to contribute the resulting tax savings (dividend-based
      contribution) to the ESOP.

The
      dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of PPL's common stock and
      is
      expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal
      income tax purposes. Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to eligible
      participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held
      in
      existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants'
      compensation.

Amounts
      charged as compensation expense for ESOP contributions approximated $6 million
      in 2005 and $5 million in each of 2004 and 2003. These amounts were offset
      by
      the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on PPL's
      earnings.

ESOP
      shares outstanding at December 31, 2005, were 8,836,536, or 2% of total common
      shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations.

Postemployment
      Benefits

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Certain
      PPL subsidiaries provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled
      employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees.
      Postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses for 2005 were $8 million
      for PPL, $4 million for PPL Energy Supply and $2 million for PPL Electric,
      primarily due to an updated valuation for Long Term Disability benefits
      completed in 2005, and were not significant in 2004 and 2003.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Certain
      of PPL Global subsidiaries, including Emel, EC, Elfec and Integra, provide
      limited non-pension benefits to all current employees. All active employees
      are
      entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance
      with government-sponsored programs. These plans generally obligate a company
      to
      pay one month's salary per year of service to employees in the event of
      involuntary termination. Under certain plans, employees with five or more years
      of service are entitled to this payment in the event of voluntary or involuntary
      termination.

The
      liabilities for these plans are accounted for under the guidance of EITF 88-1,
      "Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for a Defined Benefit Pension Plan,"
      using what is commonly referred to as the "shut down" method, where a company
      records the undiscounted obligation as if it were payable at each balance sheet
      date. The combined liabilities for these plans at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      were $10 million and $9 million, and are recorded in "Deferred Credits and
      Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheet.

Jointly-Owned
      Facilities

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

At
      December 31, 2005, subsidiaries of PPL and PPL Energy Supply owned interests
      in
      the facilities listed below. The Balance Sheets of PPL and PPL Energy Supply
      include the amounts noted in the following table.

(a)

A
                PPL subsidiary has a 50% interest in a partnership that owns the
                Griffith
                gas-fired generating station. The partnership arrangement is essentially
                a
                cost-sharing arrangement, in that each of the partners has rights
                to
                one-half of the plant capacity and energy, and an obligation to cover
                one-half of the operating costs of the station. Accordingly, the
                equity
                investment is classified as "Electric Plant in Service - Generation"
                on
                the Balance Sheet.

Each
      PPL
      Generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the facility.
      Each receives a portion of the total output of the generating stations equal
      to
      its percentage ownership. The share of fuel and other operating costs associated
      with the stations is reflected on the Statement of Income.

In
      addition to the interests mentioned above, PPL Montana is the operator of the
      jointly-owned, coal-fired generating units comprising the Colstrip steam
      generation facility. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, PPL Montana had a 50%
      leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% leasehold interest in
      Colstrip Unit 3 under operating leases. See Note 10 for additional information.

PPL
      Montana's share of direct expenses associated with the operation and maintenance
      of these facilities is included in the corresponding operating expenses on
      the
      Statement of Income. Each joint-owner in these facilities provides its own
      financing. As operator of all Colstrip Units, PPL Montana invoices each
      joint-owner for their respective portion of the direct expenses. The amount
      due
      from joint-owners was approximately $7 million and $6 million at December 31,
      2005 and 2004.

At
      December 31, 2005, NorthWestern owned a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip
      Unit
      4. PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's
      responsibilities regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, and each
      party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs,
      regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or
      4.
      However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs.

Commitments
        and Contingent Liabilities

Energy
      Purchases, Energy Sales and Other Commitments

Energy
      Purchase Commitments

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into long-term purchase contracts to supply the fuel
      requirements for generation facilities. These include contracts to purchase
      coal, emission allowances, natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel. These contracts
      extend for terms through 2019. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into
      long-term contracts for the storage and transport of natural gas. These
      contracts extend through 2014 and 2032, respectively. Additionally, PPL and
      PPL
      Energy Supply enter into long-term contracts to purchase power to meet load
      requirements. These contracts extend for terms through April 2010.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply entered into long-term power purchase agreements with two
      wind
      project developers to purchase the full output of their facilities when they
      begin commercial operation. One of the power purchase agreements is for 50-100
      MW and extends for a term of 15 years. The in-service date for this project
      is
      under evaluation. The other agreement is for 24 MW and extends for a term of
      years, and the project is expected to be in service in early 2006.

As
      part
      of the purchase of generation assets from Montana Power, PPL Montana assumed
      a
      power purchase agreement, which was still in effect at December 31, 2005.
      In accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, PPL Montana recorded a
      liability of $58 million as the estimated fair value of the agreement at the
      acquisition date. The liability is being reduced over the term of the agreement,
      through 2010, as an adjustment to "Energy purchases" on the Statement of Income.
      The unamortized balance of the liability related to the agreement at December
      31, 2005, was $49 million and is included in "Deferred Credits and Other
      Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheet.

In
      1998,
      PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual for above-market contracts with NUGs of
      $854 million, due to its generation business being deregulated. Effective
      January 1999, PPL Electric began reducing this liability as an offset to "Energy
      purchases" on the Statement of Income. This reduction is based on the estimated
      timing of the purchases from the NUGs and projected market prices for this
      generation. The final existing NUG contract expires in 2014. In connection
      with
      the corporate realignment in 2000, the remaining balance of this liability
      was
      transferred to PPL EnergyPlus. At December 31, 2005, the remaining liability
      associated with the above market NUG contracts was $206 million.

Energy
      Sales Commitments

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Energy Supply enters into long-term power sales contracts in connection with
      its
      load-serving activities or associated with certain of its power plants. These
      power sales contracts extend for terms through 2017. All long-term contracts
      were executed at pricing that approximated market rates, including profit
      margin, at the time of execution.

As
      part
      of the purchase of generation assets from Montana Power, PPL Montana assumed
      a
      power sales agreement, which was still in effect at December 31, 2005. In
      accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, PPL Montana recorded a liability
      of $7 million as the estimated fair value of the agreement at the acquisition
      date. The agreement was re-evaluated under DIG Issue C20, "Scope Exceptions:
      Interpretation of the Meaning of Not Clearly and Closely Related in Paragraph
      10(b) Regarding Contracts with a Price Adjustment Feature," which changed its
      fair value and reclassified it as a derivative instrument in 2003. At
      December 31, 2005, $5 million was recorded as a component of accumulated
      other comprehensive loss.

On
      July
      1, 2002, PPL Montana began to sell to NorthWestern an aggregate of 450 MW of
      energy supplied by PPL Montana. Under two five-year agreements, PPL Montana
      is
      supplying 300 MW of around-the-clock electricity and 150 MW of unit-contingent
      on-peak electricity. PPL Montana also makes short-term energy sales to
      NorthWestern.

In
      2002,
      PPL began commercial operations in New York of its Edgewood natural gas-fired
      generating station and its Shoreham oil-fired generating station. Each of these
      New York plants has a capacity of 79.9 MW. Initially, the Long Island Power
      Authority contracted to purchase all of Edgewood's capacity and ancillary
      services as part of a 3-year power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus
      beginning at commercial operation, and all of Shoreham's capacity and ancillary
      services as part of a 15-year power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus
      beginning at commercial operation. In 2005, PPL EnergyPlus extended the Edgewood
      power purchase agreement for an additional term that runs through October 2008.
      The Shoreham power purchase agreement remains in effect until 2017.

As
      a
      result of New Jersey's Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, the New
      Jersey Board of Public Utilities authorized and made available to power
      suppliers, on a competitive basis, the opportunity to provide Basic Generation
      Service (BGS) to all non-shopping New Jersey customers. In February 2003, PPL
      EnergyPlus was awarded a 34-month fixed-price BGS contract for a fixed
      percentage of customer load (approximately 1,000 MW) for Atlantic City Electric
      Company (ACE), Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCPL) and Public
      Service Electric & Gas Company (PSEG). This contract commenced in August
      2003. In February 2004, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded a 12-month hourly energy
      price supply BGS contract for a fixed percentage of customer load (approximately
      450 MW) for ACE, JCPL and PSEG. These contracts commenced in June 2004 and
      expired in May 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded
      a
      portion of the Commercial Industrial Energy Pricing tranche, which amounts
      to
      approximately 85 MW after expected shopping. These 12-month contracts commenced
      in June 2005. In February 2006, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded 36-month fixed-price
      BGS contracts for fixed percentages of customer load (an aggregate of
      approximately 600 MW) for ACE, JCPL and PSEG. These contracts commence in June
      2006.

In
      January 2004, PPL EnergyPlus began supplying 12.5% of Connecticut Light &
Power Company's (CL&P) Transitional Standard Offer load under a three-year
      fixed-price contract. During peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply
      the Transitional Standard Offer load may reach 625 MW. Additionally, in January
      2006, PPL EnergyPlus will begin to supply an additional 6.25% of CL&P's
      Transitional Standard Offer load under a one-year fixed-price contract. During
      peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation to supply the Transitional Standard
      Offer
      load may reach 313 MW.

In
        December 2005 and January 2006, PPL EnergyPlus entered into agreements with
        Delmarva Power and Light Company to provide a portion of its full requirements
        service from May 2006 through May 2008.

PPL
      Montana Hydroelectric License Commitments

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Montana has 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed
      by
      the FERC pursuant to the Federal Power Act under long-term licenses. Pursuant
      to
      Section 8(e) of the Federal Power Act, the FERC approved the transfer from
      Montana Power to PPL Montana of all pertinent licenses and any amendments in
      connection with the Montana APA.

The
      Kerr
      Dam Project license was jointly issued by the FERC to Montana Power and the
      Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation in 1985,
      and
      required Montana Power to hold and operate the project for 30 years. The license
      required Montana Power, and subsequently PPL Montana as a result of the purchase
      of the Kerr Dam from Montana Power, to continue to implement a plan to mitigate
      the impact of the Kerr Dam on fish, wildlife and the habitat. Under this
      arrangement, PPL Montana has a remaining commitment to spend approximately
      $19
      million between 2006 and 2015, at which point the tribes have the option to
      purchase, hold and operate the project.

PPL
      Montana entered into two Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with state, federal
      and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the FERC renewal license
      for the nine dams for the Missouri-Madison project. The MOUs require PPL Montana
      to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish, wildlife
      and
      the habitat, and to increase recreational opportunities. The MOUs were created
      to maximize collaboration between the parties and enhance the possibility for
      matching funds from relevant federal agencies. Under this arrangement, PPL
      Montana has a remaining commitment to spend approximately $35 million between
      2006 and 2040.

Legal
      Matters

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and
      litigation in the ordinary course of business. PPL and its subsidiaries cannot
      predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in
      material liabilities.

Montana
      Power Shareholders' Litigation

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      August
      2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders
      of
      Montana Power against Montana Power, the directors of Montana Power, certain
      advisors and consultants of Montana Power and PPL Montana. The plaintiffs
      allege, among other things, that Montana Power was required to, and did not,
      obtain shareholder approval of the sale of Montana Power's generation assets
      to
      PPL Montana in 1999. Although most of the claims in the complaint are against
      Montana Power, its board of directors, and its consultants and advisors, two
      claims are asserted against PPL Montana. In the first claim, plaintiffs seek
      a
      declaration that because Montana Power shareholders did not vote on the 1999
      sale of generating assets to PPL Montana, that sale "was null and void ab
      initio." The second claim alleges that PPL Montana was privy to and participated
      in a strategy whereby Montana Power would sell its generation assets to PPL
      Montana without first obtaining Montana Power shareholder approval, and that
      PPL
      Montana has made net profits in excess of $100 million as the result of this
      alleged illegal sale. In the second claim, plaintiffs request that the court
      impose a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets
      themselves and all profits, plus interest on the amounts subject to the trust.
      This lawsuit has been pending in the U.S. District Court of Montana, Butte
      Division and the judge has placed this proceeding on hold pending the outcome
      of
      certain motions currently before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
      of
      Delaware, the resolution of which may impact this proceeding. PPL and PPL Energy
      Supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

NorthWestern
      Corporation Litigation

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      September 2002, NorthWestern filed a lawsuit against PPL Montana in Montana
      state court seeking specific performance of a provision in the Montana Power
      APA
      concerning the proposed purchase by PPL Montana of a portion of NorthWestern's
      interest in the 500-kilovolt Colstrip Transmission System (CTS) for $97 million.

In
      2005,
      PPL Montana and NorthWestern settled the litigation, and PPL Energy Supply
      recorded a charge of $9 million ($6 million after tax, or $0.02 per share for
      PPL) in the first quarter of 2005 related to the settlement agreement. Pursuant
      to the settlement agreement, all claims of the parties in the litigation were
      dismissed with prejudice, NorthWestern retained its interest in the CTS, and
      PPL
      Montana paid NorthWestern $9 million in October 2005.

Montana
      Hydroelectric Litigation

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      October 2003, a lawsuit was filed against PPL Montana, PPL Services, Avista
      Corporation, PacifiCorp and nine John Doe defendants in the U.S. District Court
      of Montana, Missoula Division, by two residents allegedly acting in a
      representative capacity on behalf of the State of Montana. In January 2004,
      the
      complaint was amended to, among other things, include the Great Falls school
      districts as additional plaintiffs. In May 2004, the Montana Attorney General
      filed a motion to allow the State of Montana to intervene as an additional
      plaintiff in the litigation. This motion was granted without objection. The
      individual plaintiffs, the school districts and the State sought declaratory
      judgment, compensatory damages and attorneys fees and costs for use of state
      and/or "school trust" lands by hydropower facilities and to require the
      defendants to adequately compensate the State and/or the State School Trust
      fund
      for full market value of lands occupied. Generally, the suit is founded on
      allegations that the bed of navigable rivers became state-owned property upon
      Montana's admission to statehood, and that the use thereof for placement of
      dam
      structures, affiliated structures and reservoirs should, under an existing
      regulatory scheme, trigger lease payments for use of land underneath. The
      plaintiffs also sought relief on theories of unjust enrichment, trespass and
      negligence. No specific amount of damages or future rental value has been
      claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss
      the
      individual plaintiffs' and school districts' complaint, as well as the complaint
      of the State of Montana. In September 2004, the federal court granted the
      motions to dismiss the individual plaintiffs' and school districts' complaint
      but denied the similar motions as to the State of Montana's complaint. Following
      the federal court's September decision, PPL Montana and the other defendants
      filed a motion to dismiss the State of Montana's complaint for lack of diversity
      jurisdiction and also filed a motion to vacate certain portions of the decision.
      The federal court granted both of these motions in September 2005.

In
      November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation and PacifiCorp commenced an
      action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court seeking
      a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for the hydropower
      facilities' use and occupancy of streambeds can be collected by the State of
      Montana. The State subsequently filed counterclaims and a motion for summary
      judgment. In February 2005, the individual plaintiffs and school districts
      who
      were dismissed from the federal court proceeding, along with a state teachers'
      union, filed a motion to intervene as additional defendants in this state court
      proceeding, and also filed a proposed answer and counterclaims to be used if
      their motion to intervene is granted. The state court denied this motion to
      intervene, but has not yet ruled on any of the other above-described motions.
      PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of the state court
      proceeding.

Regulatory
      Issues

California
      ISO and Western Markets

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Through
      its subsidiaries, PPL made approximately $18 million of sales to the California
      ISO during the period from October 2000 through June 2001, of which $17 million
      has not been paid to PPL subsidiaries. Given the myriad of electricity supply
      problems presently faced by the California electric utilities and the California
      ISO, PPL cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. At December
      31,
      2005, PPL has fully reserved for possible underrecoveries of payments for these
      sales.

Regulatory
      proceedings arising out of the California electricity supply situation have
      been
      filed at the FERC. The FERC has determined that all sellers of energy into
      markets operated by the California ISO and the California Power Exchange,
      including PPL Montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period
      beginning October 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001, and initiated an evidentiary
      hearing concerning refund amounts. In April 2003, the FERC changed the manner
      in
      which this refund liability is to be computed and ordered further proceedings
      to
      determine the exact amounts that the sellers, including PPL Montana, would
      be
      required to refund. In September 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
      Circuit held that the FERC had the additional legal authority to order refunds
      for periods prior to October 2, 2000, and ordered the FERC to determine whether
      or not it would be appropriate to grant such additional refunds.

In
      June
      2003, the FERC took several actions as a result of a number of related
      investigations. The FERC terminated proceedings pursuant to which it had been
      considering whether to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in
      the
      Pacific Northwest, including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period
      December 2000 through June 2001. The FERC also commenced additional
      investigations relating to "gaming" and bidding practices during 2000 and 2001,
      but, to their knowledge, neither PPL EnergyPlus nor PPL Montana is a subject
      of
      these investigations.

Litigation
      arising out of the California electricity supply situation has been filed in
      California courts against sellers of energy to the California ISO. The
      plaintiffs and intervenors in these legal proceedings allege, among other
      things, abuse of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade
      practices and violations of state antitrust laws, and seek other relief,
      including treble damages and attorneys' fees. While PPL's subsidiaries have
      not
      been named by the plaintiffs in these legal proceedings, PPL Montana was named
      by a defendant in its cross-complaint in a consolidated court proceeding, which
      combined into one master proceeding several of the lawsuits alleging antitrust
      violations and unfair trade practices. This generator denies that any unlawful,
      unfair or fraudulent conduct occurred but asserts that, if it is found liable,
      the other generators and power marketers, including PPL Montana, caused,
      contributed to and/or participated in the plaintiffs' alleged
      losses.

In
      February 2004, the Montana Public Service Commission initiated a limited
      investigation of the Montana retail electricity market for the years 2000 and
      2001, focusing on how that market was affected by transactions involving the
      possible manipulation of the electricity grid in the western U.S. The
      investigation includes all public utilities and licensed electricity suppliers
      in Montana, as well as other entities that may possess relevant information.
      Through its subsidiaries, PPL is a licensed electricity supplier in Montana
      and
      a wholesale supplier in the western U.S. In June 2004, the Montana Attorney
      General served PPL Montana and more than 20 other companies with subpoenas
      requesting documents, and PPL Montana has provided responsive documents to
      the
      Montana Attorney General. As with the other investigations taking place as
      a
      result of the issues arising out of the electricity supply situation in
      California and other western states, PPL and its subsidiaries believe that
      they
      have not engaged in any improper trading or marketing practices affecting the
      Montana retail electricity market.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries believe that they have not engaged in any improper trading
      practices. However, they cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, any
      PPL
      subsidiaries will be the target of any additional governmental investigations
      or
      named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings. PPL also cannot predict the
      outcome of any such lawsuits or proceedings or whether the ultimate impact
      on
      them of the electricity supply situation in California and other western states
      will be material.

PJM
      Capacity Litigation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      December 2002, PPL was served with a complaint against PPL, PPL EnergyPlus
      and
      PPL Electric filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
      Pennsylvania by a group of 14 Pennsylvania boroughs that apparently alleges,
      among other things, violations of the federal antitrust laws in connection
      with
      the pricing of installed capacity in the PJM daily market during the first
      quarter of 2001. These boroughs were wholesale customers of PPL Electric. In
      addition, in November 2003, PPL and PPL EnergyPlus were served with a complaint
      which was filed in the same court by Joseph Martorano, III (d/b/a ENERCO),
      that
      also alleges violations of the federal antitrust laws in early 2001. The
      complaint indicates that ENERCO provides consulting and energy procurement
      services to clients in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In September 2004, this
      complaint was dismissed by the District Court, and in June 2005 the U.S. Court
      of Appeals for the Third Circuit denied the plaintiff's appeal.

Each
      of
      the U.S. Department of Justice - Antitrust Division, the FERC and the
      Pennsylvania Attorney General conducted investigations regarding PPL's PJM
      capacity market transactions in early 2001 and did not find any reason to take
      action against PPL.

New
      England Investigation

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      January 2004, PPL became aware of an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney
      General and the FERC's Office of Market Oversight and Investigation (OMOI)
      regarding allegations that natural gas-fired generators located in New England
      illegally sold natural gas instead of generating electricity during the week
      of
      January 12, 2004. Subsequently, PPL and other generators were served with a
      data
      request by OMOI. The data request indicated that PPL was not under suspicion
      of
      a regulatory violation, but that OMOI was conducting an initial investigation.
      PPL has responded to this data request. PPL also has responded to data requests
      of ISO New England and data requests served by subpoena from the Connecticut
      Attorney General. Both OMOI and ISO New England have issued preliminary reports
      finding no regulatory or other violations concerning these matters. While PPL
      does not believe that it committed any regulatory or other violations concerning
      the subject matter of these investigations, PPL cannot predict the outcome
      of
      these investigations.

PJM
      Billing

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      December 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy,
      Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC
      alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as
      a
      result of an error by PJM in the State Estimator Model used in connection with
      billing all PJM customers for certain transmission, spot market energy and
      ancillary services charges. Specifically, the complaint alleges that PJM
      mistakenly identified PPL Electric's Elroy substation transformer as belonging
      to PECO and that, as a consequence, during times of congestion, PECO's bills
      for
      transmission congestion from PJM erroneously reflected energy that PPL Electric
      took from the Elroy substation and used to serve PPL Electric's load. The
      complaint requests the FERC, among other things, to direct PPL Electric to
      refund to PJM $39 million, plus interest of approximately $8 million, and for
      PJM to refund these same amounts to PECO. In February 2005, PPL Electric filed
      its response with the FERC stating that neither PPL Electric nor any of its
      affiliates should be held financially responsible or liable to PJM or PECO
      as a
      result of PJM's error.

In
      April
      2005, the FERC issued an Order Establishing Hearing and Settlement Judge
      Proceedings (the Order). In the Order, the FERC determined that PECO is entitled
      to reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges that PECO asserts
      PJM
      erroneously billed to it at the Elroy substation. The FERC set for additional
      proceedings before a judge the determination of the amount of the overcharge
      to
      PECO and which PJM market participants were undercharged and therefore are
      responsible for reimbursement to PECO. The FERC also ordered procedures before
      a
      judge to attempt to reach a settlement of the dispute.

PPL
      Electric recognized an after-tax charge of approximately $27 million (or $0.07
      per share for PPL) in the first quarter of 2005 for a loss contingency related
      to this matter. The pre-tax accrual was approximately $47 million, with $39
      million included in "Energy purchases" on the Statement of Income, and $8
      million in "Interest Expense."

In
      September 2005, PPL Electric and Exelon Corporation filed a proposed settlement
      agreement regarding this matter with the FERC. Under the settlement agreement,
      PPL Electric would pay $33 million plus interest over a four-year period to
      PJM
      through a new transmission charge that, under applicable law, is recoverable
      from PPL Electric's retail customers. Also, all PJM market participants would
      pay approximately $8 million plus interest over a four-year period to PJM
      through a new market adjustment charge. PJM would forward amounts collected
      under the two new charges to PECO. PJM filed comments with the FERC neither
      supporting nor opposing the settlement agreement, and the FERC Trial Staff
      filed
      comments with the FERC supporting the settlement agreement. Numerous other
      parties, including PJM market participants, filed comments with the FERC
      opposing the settlement agreement. The FERC has not yet acted on the proposed
      settlement agreement.

PPL,
      PPL
      Electric and PPL Energy Supply cannot be certain of the outcome of this matter
      or the impact on PPL and its subsidiaries. Some or all of the first quarter
      charges for this matter may be reversed in a future period depending on the
      outcome of this matter, the potential for recovery of any amounts paid as a
      result of the additional FERC proceedings, the application of the relevant
      provisions of the energy supply agreements between PPL Electric and PPL
      EnergyPlus and other factors. Depending on these factors, PPL Energy Supply,
      the
      parent company of PPL EnergyPlus, may incur some or all of the costs associated
      with this matter in a future period.

FERC
      Market-Based Rate Authority

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      December 1998, the FERC issued an order authorizing PPL EnergyPlus to make
      wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates.
      In
      that order, the FERC directed PPL EnergyPlus to file an updated market analysis
      within three years of the date of the order, and every three years thereafter.
      PPL EnergyPlus filed its initial updated market analysis in December 2001.
      Several parties thereafter filed interventions and protests requesting that
      PPL
      EnergyPlus be required to provide additional information demonstrating that
      it
      has met the FERC's market power tests necessary for PPL EnergyPlus to continue
      its market-based rate authority. PPL EnergyPlus has responded that the FERC
      does
      not require the economic test suggested by the intervenors and that, in any
      event, it would meet such economic test if required by the FERC.

In
      June
      2004, FERC approved certain changes to its standards for granting market-based
      rate authority. As a result of the schedule adopted by the FERC, PPL EnergyPlus,
      PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of PPL Generation's subsidiaries were
      required to file, in November 2004, updated analyses demonstrating that they
      should continue to maintain market-based rate authority under the new standards.
      PPL made two filings, a Western market-based rate filing for PPL Montana and
      an
      Eastern market-based rate filing for most of the other PPL subsidiaries in
      the
      PJM region.

In
      September 2005, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the Eastern
      market-based rate filing. The FERC expressly rejected the concerns raised by
      various consumer advocates and industrial customers regarding generation market
      power of PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's generation subsidiaries in the PJM
      region. The FERC's order required the subsidiaries to make a compliance filing
      providing further support that they cannot erect other non-transmission barriers
      to entry into the generation market, and the PPL subsidiaries made this
      compliance filing in October 2005.

Also
      in
      September 2005, in an order on PPL's western market-based rate filing, the
      FERC
      found that PPL Montana did not pass one of the FERC's initial screening tests
      for market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area, namely the wholesale
      market share screen. As a result, PPL Montana was required to make a more
      detailed filing with the FERC demonstrating that it meets the market power
      tests. Also, the FERC has established a refund effective date of November 8,
      2005 (for sales made in the Northwestern Energy Control Area

pursuant
      to contracts entered into on and

after that date), in the event that PPL
      Montana does not pass the FERC's market power tests. The FERC's order is not
      a
      definitive determination that PPL Montana has market power but rather the FERC's
      mechanism for analyzing market-based rate authority applications that require
      further scrutiny. In October 2005, PPL Montana made the more detailed filing
      with the FERC, which PPL Montana believes demonstrates that it cannot exercise
      generation market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area and should
      be
      granted market-based rate authority in that area. The FERC has not yet acted
      on
      this more detailed filing. While PPL Montana continues to believe that it does
      not have market power in the Northwestern Energy Control Area, it cannot predict
      the outcome of this proceeding.

FERC
      Proposed Rules

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      July
      2002, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled "Remedying Undue
      Discrimination through Open Access Transmission Service and Standard Electricity
      Market Design." The proposed rule contained a proposed implementation date
      of
      July 31, 2003. This far-reaching proposed rule purported to establish uniform
      transmission rules and a standard market design by, among other
      things:

In
      April
      2003, the FERC issued a white paper describing certain modifications to the
      proposed rule. The FERC requested comments and held numerous public comment
      sessions concerning the white paper. In July 2005, the FERC terminated the
      proposed rule based on its conclusion that the objectives of the proposed rule
      had been overtaken by other events in the industry, such as the continuing
      development of voluntary ISOs and RTOs.

In
      November 2003, the FERC adopted a proposed rule to require all existing and
      new
      electric market-based tariffs and authorizations to include provisions
      prohibiting the seller from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exercise
      of market power. The FERC order adopts a list of market behavior rules that
      apply to all electric market-based rate tariffs and authorizations, including
      those of PPL EnergyPlus and any other PPL subsidiaries that hold market-based
      rate authority. PPL does not expect this rule to have a significant impact
      on
      its subsidiaries.

Wallingford
      Cost-Based Rates

(

PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      January 2003, PPL negotiated an agreement with ISO New England that would
      declare that four of the five units at PPL's Wallingford, Connecticut facility
      are "reliability must run" units and put those units under cost-based rates.
      This agreement and the cost-based rates are subject to the FERC's approval.
      PPL
      filed a request with the FERC for such approval. PPL requested authority for
      cost-based rates because the current and anticipated wholesale prices in New
      England are insufficient to cover the costs of keeping these units available
      for
      operation. In March 2003, PPL filed an application with the New England Power
      Pool to temporarily deactivate these four units. In May 2003, the FERC denied
      PPL's request for cost-based rates in light of the FERC's changes to the market
      and bid mitigation rules of ISO New England made in a similar case involving
      generating units owned by NRG Energy, Inc. PPL subsequently has explained to
      the
      FERC that its changes to the market and bid mitigation rules of ISO New England
      will not provide sufficient revenues to PPL, and PPL continues to seek approval
      of its cost-based rates. However, PPL has informed the New England Power Pool
      that it will not pursue its request to temporarily deactivate certain
      Wallingford units. In August 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
      of
      Columbia Circuit reversed the FERC's denial of PPL's request for cost-based
      rates and remanded the case to the FERC for further consideration. PPL cannot
      predict the outcome of this matter.

IRS
      Synthetic Fuels Tax Credits

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL,
      through its subsidiaries, has interests in two synthetic fuel production
      facilities: the Somerset facility located in Pennsylvania and the Tyrone
      facility located in Kentucky. PPL receives tax credits pursuant to Section
      29 of
      the Internal Revenue Code based on the sale of synthetic fuel from these
      facilities to unaffiliated

third-party
      purchasers. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for
      the
      production and sale of solid synthetic fuels produced from coal. Section 29
      tax
      credits are currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2007.

To
      qualify for the Section 29 tax credits, the synthetic fuel must meet three
      primary conditions: (i) there must be a significant chemical change in the
      coal
      feedstock, (ii) the product must be sold to an unaffiliated entity, and (iii)
      the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1,
      1998.

In
      addition, Section 29 provides for the synthetic fuel tax credit to begin to
      phase-out when the relevant annual reference price for crude oil, which is
      the
      domestic first purchase price (DFPP), falls within a designated range and to
      be
      eliminated when the DFPP exceeds the range. The phase-out range is adjusted
      annually for inflation. The DFPP is published by the IRS annually in April
      for
      the prior year and is calculated based on the annual average wellhead price
      per
      barrel for all unregulated domestic crude oil. Accounting for inflation, PPL
      estimates that the 2005 tax credit phase-out would start at a DFPP for the
      year
      of about $52 per barrel and the tax credit would be totally eliminated at about
      $65 per barrel. PPL currently does not expect any phase-out of the synthetic
      fuel tax credit for 2005. Based on current market conditions and given the
      recent increases in and volatility of crude oil prices, PPL cannot predict
      the
      final DFPP for crude oil for 2006 and 2007 or inflation for those years that
      affects the determination of the phase-out range of the tax credit.

PPL
      has
      entered into economic hedge transactions that serve to mitigate some of the
      earnings and cash flow impact of increases in crude oil prices for 2006 and
      2007, with the mark-to-market value of these hedges reflected in "Energy-related
      businesses" revenues on the Statement of Income. Nonetheless, if the price
      of
      crude oil remains at, or increases above, current price levels in 2006 or 2007,
      PPL's expected synthetic fuel tax credits for either or both of those years
      could be significantly reduced. Based on forecasted oil prices and other market
      factors for 2006 and 2007, PPL will evaluate its synthetic fuel production
      levels and operations.

A
      PPL
      subsidiary owns and operates the Somerset facility. In November 2001, PPL
      received a private letter ruling from the IRS pursuant to which, among other
      things, the IRS concluded that the synthetic fuel produced at the Somerset
      facility qualifies for Section 29 tax credits. The Somerset facility uses the
      Covol technology to produce synthetic fuel, and the IRS issued the private
      letter ruling after its review and approval of that technology. In reliance
      on
      this private letter ruling, PPL has sold synthetic fuel produced at the Somerset
      facility resulting in an aggregate of approximately $267 million of tax
      credits as of December 31, 2005.

PPL
      owns
      a limited partnership interest in the entity that owns and operates the Tyrone
      facility. In April 2004, this entity received a private letter ruling from
      the
      IRS. Similar to its conclusions relating to the Somerset facility, the IRS
      concluded that the synthetic fuel to be produced at the Tyrone facility
      qualifies for Section 29 tax credits. In reliance on this private letter ruling,
      this entity has sold synthetic fuel produced at the Tyrone facility resulting
      in
      an aggregate of approximately $60 million of tax credits as of December 31,
      2005. The Tyrone facility began commercial operation in the third quarter of
      2004, after being relocated to Kentucky from Pennsylvania.

PPL
      also
      purchases synthetic fuel from unaffiliated third parties, at prices below the
      market price of coal, for use at its coal-fired power plants.

In
      October 2003, it was reported that the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
      Investigations, of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, had begun an
      investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and its producers. That
      investigation is ongoing. PPL cannot predict when the investigation will be
      completed or the potential results of the investigation.

Energy
      Policy Act of 2005

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      August
      2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the "2005
      Energy Act"). The 2005 Energy Act is comprehensive legislation that will
      substantially affect the regulation of energy companies.

The
      Act
      amends federal energy laws and provides the FERC with new oversight
      responsibilities.

Among
      the
      important changes to be implemented as a result of this legislation
      are:

The
      implementation of the 2005 Energy Act requires proceedings at the state level
      and the development of regulations by the FERC, the DOE and other federal
      agencies, some of which have been finalized. PPL cannot predict when all of
      these proceedings and regulations will be finalized.

PPL
      cannot predict with certainty the impact of the 2005 Energy Act and any related
      regulations on PPL and its subsidiaries.

Environmental
      Matters - Domestic

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Due
      to
      the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, PPL
      subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain
      facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies
      or courts. In this regard, PPL subsidiaries also may incur capital expenditures
      or operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could
      be
      significant.

Air

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      Clean
      Air Act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal ambient ozone
      standards, fine particulate matter standards and toxic air emissions and
      visibility in the U.S. Amendments to the Clean Air Act, although not presently
      under consideration, are likely to continue to be brought up for consideration
      in the U.S. Congress. Past proposed amendments would have required significant
      further reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and
      reductions in emissions of mercury beyond the reductions discussed
      below.

Citing
      its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has developed new standards
      for
      ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the U.S. These standards have
      been upheld following court challenges. To facilitate attainment of these
      standards, the EPA has promulgated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) for
      midwestern and eastern states, including Pennsylvania, to reduce national sulfur
      dioxide emissions by about 50% by 2010 and to extend the current seasonal
      program for nitrogen oxide emission reductions to a year-round program starting
      in 2009. The CAIR requires further reductions, starting in 2015, in sulfur
      dioxide and nitrogen oxide of 30% and 20%, respectively, from 2010 levels.
      The
      CAIR allows these reductions to be achieved through cap-and-trade programs.
      Pennsylvania and Montana have not challenged the CAIR, but the rule has been
      challenged by several states and environmental groups as not being sufficiently
      strict, and by industry petitioners as being too strict. In addition, several
      Canadian environmental groups have petitioned the EPA under the Clean Air Act
      to
      revise the CAIR to require deeper reductions in sulfur dioxide and mercury
      emissions.

In
      order
      to continue meeting existing sulfur dioxide reduction requirements of the Clean
      Air Act, PPL is proceeding with the installation of sulfur dioxide scrubbers
      at
      its Montour Units 1 and 2 and Brunner Island Unit 3 by 2008, and also plans
      to
      install a scrubber at Brunner Island Units 1 and 2 by 2009. Based on expected
      levels of generation, emission allowance shortfalls that would otherwise occur
      without significant additional purchases of allowances and projected emission
      allowance prices, PPL has determined that it is more economic to install these
      scrubbers than to purchase significant additional emission allowances. PPL's
      current installation plan for the scrubbers and other pollution control
      equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
      reduction) from 2005 to 2010 reflects a cost of approximately $1.5 billion.

Also
      citing its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has finalized mercury
      regulations that affect coal-fired plants. These regulations establish an
      emission trading program to take effect beginning January 2010, with a second
      phase to take effect in 2018. At the same time that it finalized these mercury
      regulations, the EPA determined that it currently does not need to regulate
      nickel emissions from oil-fired units. PPL is still assessing what measures
      it
      will need to take to comply with the mercury regulations. PPL expects that
      the
      scrubbers to be installed at Montour and Brunner Island will provide mercury
      removal co-benefits. However, PPL believes that it may need to take additional
      measures to comply with the 2010 requirements of the EPA's mercury regulations
      and that it will need to take additional measures to comply with the 2018
      requirements. The capital costs to PPL of complying with these new mercury
      regulations are not now determinable, but could be significant. Based on
      preliminary industry estimates, the costs are expected to exceed $150
      million.

Pennsylvania
      and ten other states have challenged the new EPA mercury regulations in the
      D.C.
      Circuit Court of Appeals as not being sufficiently strict. The Pennsylvania
      Environmental Quality Board (PaEQB) has accepted a petition filed by PennFuture,
      an environmental citizens organization, requesting the PaEQB to develop mercury
      rules that would require by 2008 a level of mercury reduction that would be
      more
      stringent than the level required by 2018 under the EPA's mercury regulations.
      In addition, the Ozone Transport Commission (consisting of Pennsylvania and
      other states and the District of Columbia) has passed a resolution calling
      for
      reductions in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions that are
      more
      stringent than those under CAIR and the EPA's mercury regulations. The
      Pennsylvania DEP (which works with the PaEQB to develop Pennsylvania
      environmental regulations) has initiated a process to develop mercury
      regulations that are expected to be more stringent than the EPA's regulations
      but different from those requested by PennFuture, and it also has indicated
      support for developing more stringent regulations for reductions in sulfur
      dioxide and nitrogen oxide. A proposed rule is expected by
      mid-2006.

As
      a
      result of a petition to initiate state-specific rulemaking for mercury emissions
      that was filed by a coalition of environmental and other public interest groups
      with the Montana Board of Environmental Review (BER) in September 2005, the
      Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is developing a rule to
      recommend to the BER. The DEQ has circulated to certain parties, including
      PPL
      Montana, a preliminary proposed rule that PPL Montana is evaluating. The rule
      presently is expected to be formally proposed to the BER in March
      2006.

PPL
      and
      other energy companies and industry groups oppose state-specific regulations
      that are more stringent than the current federal rules and regulations regarding
      nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. PPL cannot predict whether
      more stringent regulations will ultimately be adopted in Pennsylvania or
      Montana. The additional costs to comply with any such regulations are not now
      determinable, but could be significant.

In
      addition to the above rules, the Clean Air Visibility Rule was issued by the
      EPA
      on June 15, 2005, to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility
      caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available
      Retrofit Technology requirements for electric generating units, including
      presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide controls for large
      units. The EPA has stated that this rule will not require reductions in sulfur
      dioxide or nitrogen oxide beyond those required by CAIR. At this time, PPL
      cannot predict whether the Pennsylvania DEP will require additional reductions
      beyond the visibility requirements established through CAIR. If the Pennsylvania
      DEP establishes regulations to require additional reductions, the additional
      costs to comply with such regulations, which are not now determinable, could
      be
      significant. In states like Montana that are not within the CAIR region, the
      need for and costs of additional controls as a result of this new rule are
      not
      now determinable, but could be significant.

In
      1999,
      the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several utilities, asserting
      that
      older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have, over the years,
      been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent "New Source"
      requirements under the Clean Air Act. The EPA subsequently issued notices of
      violation and commenced enforcement activities against other utilities. However,
      in the past several years, the EPA has shifted its position on New Source
      Review. In 2003, the EPA issued changes to its regulations that clarified what
      projects are exempt from "New Source" requirements as routine maintenance and
      repair. However, these regulations have been stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals
      for the District of Columbia Circuit. PPL is therefore continuing to operate
      under the "New Source" regulations as they existed prior to the EPA's 2003
      clarifications.

In
      October 2005, the EPA proposed changing its rules on how to determine whether
      a
      project results in an emissions increase and is therefore subject to review
      under the "New Source" regulations. The EPA's proposed tests are consistent
      with
      the position of energy companies and industry groups and, if adopted, would
      substantially reduce the uncertainties under the current regulations. PPL cannot
      predict whether these proposed new tests will be adopted. In addition to
      proposing these new tests, the EPA also announced in October 2005 that it will
      not bring new enforcement actions with respect to projects that would satisfy
      the proposed new tests or the EPA's 2003 clarifications referenced above.
      Accordingly, PPL believes that it is unlikely that the EPA will follow up on
      the
      information requests that had been issued to PPL Montana's Corette and Colstrip
      plants by EPA Region VIII in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and to PPL
      Generation's Martins Creek plant by EPA Region III in 2002. However, states
      and
      environmental groups also have been bringing enforcement actions alleging
      violations of "New Source" requirements by coal-fired plants, and PPL is unable
      to predict whether such state or citizens enforcement actions will be brought
      with respect to any of its affiliates' plants.

The
      New
      Jersey DEP and some New Jersey residents raised environmental concerns with
      respect to the Martins Creek plant, particularly with respect to sulfur dioxide
      emissions and the opacity of the plant's plume. These issues were raised in
      the
      context of an appeal by the New Jersey DEP of the Air Quality Plan Approval
      issued by the Pennsylvania DEP to PPL's Lower Mt. Bethel generating plant.
      In
      October 2003, PPL finalized an agreement with the New Jersey DEP and the
      Pennsylvania DEP pursuant to which PPL will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
      from
      its Martins Creek power plant. Under the agreement, PPL Martins Creek will
      shut
      down the plant's two coal-fired generating units by September 2007 and may
      repower them any time after shutting them down so long as it follows all
      applicable state and federal requirements, including installing the best
      available pollution control technology. Pursuant to the agreement, PPL Martins
      Creek began reducing the fuel sulfur content for the coal units as well as
      the
      plant's two oil-fired units in June 2004. The agreement also calls for PPL
      to
      donate to a non-profit organization 70% of the excess emission allowances and
      emission reduction credits that result from shutting down or repowering the
      coal
      units. Some of these donations have already been made to the Pennsylvania
      Environmental Council. As a result of the agreement, the New Jersey DEP withdrew
      its challenge to the Air Quality Plan Approval for the Lower Mt. Bethel
      facility. The agreement will not result in material costs to PPL. The agreement
      does not address the issues raised by the New Jersey DEP regarding the visible
      opacity of emissions from the oil-fired units at the Martins Creek plant.
      Similar issues also are being raised by the Pennsylvania DEP. PPL is currently
      negotiating the matter with the Pennsylvania DEP. If it is determined that
      actions must be taken to address the visible opacity of these emissions, such
      actions could result in costs that are not now determinable, but could be
      significant.

In
      addition to the opacity concerns raised by the New Jersey DEP, PPL and the
      Pennsylvania DEP were engaged in litigation relating to the opacity of emissions
      from the Montour plant. That litigation now has been resolved. The settlement
      does not impose any material costs.

In
      December 2003, PPL Montana, as operator of the Colstrip facility, received
      an
      Administrative Compliance Order (ACO) from the EPA pursuant to the Clean Air
      Act. The ACO alleges that Units 3 and 4 of the facility have been in violation
      of the Clean Air Act permit at Colstrip since 1980. The permit required Colstrip
      to submit for review and approval by the EPA an analysis and proposal for
      reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide to address visibility concerns upon the
      occurrence of certain triggering events. The EPA is asserting that regulations
      it promulgated in 1980 triggered this requirement. PPL believes that the ACO
      is
      unfounded. PPL is engaged in settlement negotiations on these matters with
      the
      EPA, the Montana DEQ and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.

In
      addition to the requirements related to emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
      oxide and mercury noted above, there is a growing concern nationally and
      internationally about carbon dioxide emissions. In June 2005, the U.S. Senate
      adopted a resolution declaring that mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide
      are
      needed. Various legislative proposals are being considered in Congress, and
      several states already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions.
      The Bush administration is promoting a voluntary carbon dioxide reduction
      program, called the Climate VISION program. In support of this program, the
      electric power industry has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emission
      intensity levels (measured as tons of carbon dioxide equivalent against electric
      power production in MWh) by 3% to 5% by the 2010 to 2012 period. Furthermore,
      in
      December 2005, seven northeastern states (New York, Connecticut, Delaware,
      Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont) signed an MOU establishing a
      cap
      and trade program commencing in January 2009 for stabilization of carbon dioxide
      emissions, at base levels established in 2005, from electric power plants larger
      than 25 MW in capacity. This MOU also provides for a 10% reduction in carbon
      dioxide emissions from the base levels by the end of 2018. Increased pressure
      for carbon dioxide emissions reduction also is coming from investor
      organizations and the international community.

Pennsylvania
      and Montana have not, at this time, established any formal programs to address
      carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. PPL has conducted an inventory of
      its
      carbon dioxide emissions and is continuing to evaluate various options for
      reducing, avoiding, off-setting or sequestering its emissions. If Pennsylvania
      or Montana develop regulations imposing mandatory reductions of carbon dioxide
      and other greenhouse gases on generation facilities, the cost to PPL of such
      reductions could be significant.

In
      June
      2005, PPL Montour, along with 20 other companies with coal-fired generating
      plants, was named as a defendant in a toxic-tort, purported class-action lawsuit
      filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The complaint alleged damages
      in
      the approximate amount of Canadian $49 billion (approximately $42 billion at
      current exchange rates), along with continuing damages in the amount of Canadian
      $4.1 billion (approximately $3.5 billion at current exchange rates) per year
      and
      punitive damages of Canadian $1 billion (approximately $858 million at current
      exchange rates), along with such other relief as the court deems just. However,
      the deadline for serving the complaint on PPL Montour now has expired. PPL
      does
      not believe that the complaint was served on any of the defendants, and it
      is
      not clear whether the plaintiffs intend to pursue this action.

Water/Waste

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      August
      2005, a leak from a disposal basin containing fly ash and water used in
      connection with the operation of the two 150-MW coal-fired generating units
      at
      the Martins Creek generating facility caused the discharge of approximately
      million gallons of water containing ash from the basin onto adjacent roadways
      and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware River. The leak was
      stopped, and PPL has determined that the problem was caused by a failure in
      the
      disposal basin's discharge structure. PPL is continuing to work with the
      Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies and consultants to assess the
      extent of the environmental damage caused by the ash in the discharged water
      and
      to remediate the damage. PPL shut down the two coal-fired generating units
      in
      August 2005 and placed the units back in service in December 2005 after
      completing the repairs and upgrades to the basin and obtaining the Pennsylvania
      DEP's approval.

On
      September 20, 2005, PPL Martins Creek and the Pennsylvania DEP were served
      with
      notice by the Delaware Riverside Conservancy and several citizens of their
      intention to file a citizens' suit on the basis that the leak from the disposal
      basin at Martins Creek allegedly violated various state and federal laws. The
      Pennsylvania DEP subsequently filed a complaint in Commonwealth court against
      PPL Martins Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state
      laws
      and regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief. The Delaware
      Riverside Conservancy and several citizens have filed a motion to intervene
      in
      the Pennsylvania DEP's action, which motion includes a class action complaint
      alleging that the fly ash spill caused damages to property along a 40-mile
      stretch of the Delaware River. PPL has objected to the intervention by certain
      of the intervenors and both PPL and the Pennsylvania DEP have objected to the
      purported class action suit. PPL intends to engage in settlement discussions
      to
      resolve the Pennsylvania DEP action.

At
      this
      time, PPL has no reason to believe that the Martins Creek leak has caused any
      danger to human health or any adverse biological impact on the river aquatic
      life. However, a group of natural resource trustees, along with the Delaware
      River Basin Commission, has been conducting an assessment of any natural
      resource damages that could have been caused by the Martins Creek leak. PPL
      expects the trustees and the Delaware River Basin Commission to seek to recover
      their costs as well as any damages they determine were caused by the leak.
      PPL
      cannot predict when the assessment will be completed but does not expect it
      to
      be completed before the end of 2006.

PPL
      Energy Supply recognized a $33 million charge in the third quarter of 2005
      and
      an additional $15 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 (or a total
      of
      $31 million after tax, or $0.08 per share for PPL) in connection with the
      current expected on-site and off-site costs relating to the leak. Approximately
      $41 million of the total charge, or $27 million after tax, relates to the
      off-site costs, and the balance of the total charge, $7 million, or $4 million
      after tax, relates to the on-site costs. The pre-tax accrual of $48 million
      was
      included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income. PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the final cost of assessment and
      remediation of the leak, the outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania
      DEP, the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, and the exact nature
      of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against
      PPL, PPL Energy Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin
      leak. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also cannot predict the extent of the fines
      or
      damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions or the ultimate
      financial impact on PPL or PPL Energy Supply.

Seepages
      have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins at various PPL
      plants, including the Montour, Brunner Island and Martins Creek generating
      facilities. PPL has completed an assessment of some of the seepages at the
      Montour and Brunner Island facilities and is working with the Pennsylvania
      DEP
      to implement abatement measures for those seepages. PPL is continuing to conduct
      assessments of other seepages at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities
      as
      well as seepages at the Martins Creek facility to determine the appropriate
      abatement actions. PPL plans to comprehensively address issues related to
      wastewater basins at all of its Pennsylvania plants, as part of the process
      to
      renew the residual waste permits for these basins that expire within the next
      three years. The cost of addressing seepages at PPL's Pennsylvania plants is
      not
      now determinable, but could be significant.

In
      May
      2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs brought an action now pending at the Montana
      Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County, against PPL Montana and
      the
      other owners of the Colstrip plant alleging property damage from seepage from
      the freshwater and wastewater ponds at Colstrip. PPL Montana has undertaken
      certain groundwater investigation and remediation measures at the Colstrip
      plant
      to address groundwater contamination alleged by the plaintiffs as well as other
      groundwater contamination at the plant. These measures include offering to
      extend city water to certain residents who live near the plant, some of whom
      are
      plaintiffs in the litigation. Beyond the original estimated reserve of $1
      million recorded by PPL Montana in 2004 (of which only an insignificant amount
      remains at December 31, 2005) for a proposed settlement of the property damage
      claims raised in the litigation, for extending city water and for a portion
      of
      the remedial investigation costs, PPL Montana may incur further costs based
      on
      its additional groundwater investigations and any related remedial measures,
      which costs are not now determinable, but could be significant.

The
      Pennsylvania DEP has stated that the temperature of the cooling water discharge
      at the Brunner Island plant must be lowered. The Pennsylvania DEP has also
      stated that it believes the plant is in violation of a permit condition
      prohibiting the discharge from changing the river temperature by more than
      two
      degrees per hour. PPL is discussing these matters with the agency. Depending
      on
      the outcome of these discussions, the plant could be subject to additional
      capital and operating costs that are not now determinable, but could be
      significant. In early January, PPL received notice from PennFuture (an
      environmental citizens organization) that they intended to sue PPL for alleged
      violations of the permit condition that prohibits the discharge from changing
      the river temperature by more than two degrees per hour. PPL cannot predict
      the
      outcome of this potential citizens' suit.

The
      EPA
      has significantly tightened the water quality standard for arsenic. The revised
      standard becomes effective in 2006. The revised standard may result in action
      by
      individual states that could require several PPL subsidiaries to either further
      treat wastewater or take abatement action at their power plants, or both. The
      cost of complying with any such requirements is not now determinable, but could
      be significant.

The
      EPA
      finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified water intake structures.
      These requirements affect where generating facilities are built, establish
      intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling towers
      at
      new and modified power plants. Another new rule that was finalized in 2004
      addresses existing structures. PPL does not believe that either of these rules
      will impose material costs on PPL subsidiaries. However, six northeastern states
      have challenged the new rules for existing structures as being inadequate.
      If
      this challenge is successful, it could result in the EPA establishing stricter
      standards for existing structures that could impose significant costs on PPL
      subsidiaries.

Superfund
      and Other Remediation

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      1995,
      PPL Electric and PPL Generation and, in 1996, PPL Gas Utilities entered into
      consent orders with the Pennsylvania DEP to address a number of sites that
      were
      not being addressed under another regulatory program such as Superfund, but
      for
      which PPL Electric, PPL Generation or PPL Gas Utilities may be liable for
      remediation. This may include potential PCB contamination at certain PPL
      Electric substations and pole sites; potential contamination at a number of
      coal
      gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric; oil
      or
      other contamination that may exist at some of PPL Electric's former generating
      facilities; and potential contamination at abandoned power plant sites owned
      by
      PPL Generation. This may also include former coal gas manufacturing facilities
      and potential mercury contamination from gas meters and regulators at PPL Gas
      Utilities' sites.

Since
      the
      PPL Electric Consent Order expired on January 31, 2005, and since only four
      sites remained, PPL has negotiated a new consent order and agreement (COA)
      with
      the Pennsylvania DEP that combines both PPL Electric's and PPL Gas Utilities'
      consent orders into one single agreement. As of December 31, 2005, PPL Electric
      and PPL Gas Utilities have 144 sites to address under the new combined COA.
      Additional sites formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric, PPL Generation
      or
      PPL Gas Utilities are added to the consent orders on a case-by-case
      basis.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities had accrued approximately
      $2 million and $6 million, respectively, representing the estimated amounts
      each
      will have to spend for site remediation, including those sites covered by each
      company's consent orders mentioned above. Depending on the outcome of
      investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or have not been
      completed, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be substantial.
      PPL and its subsidiaries also could incur other non-remediation costs at sites
      included in the consent orders or other contaminated sites, the costs of which
      are not now determinable, but could be significant.

The
      Pennsylvania DEP has raised concerns regarding potential leakage of natural
      gas
      from the Tioga gas storage field owned by PPL Gas Utilities. The Pennsylvania
      DEP believes gas is leaking from the storage field and causing methane impacts
      to nearby residential wells. While PPL Gas has no evidence to confirm or deny
      the Pennsylvania DEP's position, PPL Gas Utilities has initiated a plan to
      identify and address potential sources of gas leakage from the field. PPL Gas
      Utilities is discussing the matter with the operator of the field and with
      the
      Pennsylvania DEP.

The
      EPA
      is evaluating the risks associated with naphthalene, a chemical by-product
      of
      coal gas manufacturing operations. As a result of the EPA's evaluation,
      individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil
      clean-up. This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive
      assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing facilities.
      The
      costs to PPL of complying with any such requirements are not now determinable,
      but could be significant.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Under
      the
      Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated
      to
      remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take
      additional measures to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped
      refuse piles. One PPL Generation subsidiary is pumping and treating mine water
      at two mine sites. Another PPL Generation subsidiary is installing passive
      wetlands treatment at a third site, and the Pennsylvania DEP has suggested
      that
      it may require that PPL Generation subsidiary to pump and treat the mine water
      at that third site. At December 31, 2005, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary had
      accrued $28 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating groundwater
      at
      the two mine sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining passive
      wetlands treatment at the third site.

In
      1999,
      the Montana Supreme Court held in favor of several citizens' groups that the
      right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed
      by
      the Montana Constitution. The court's ruling could result in significantly
      more
      stringent environmental laws and regulations, as well as an increase in
      citizens' suits under Montana's environmental laws. The effect on PPL Montana
      of
      any such changes in laws or regulations or any such increase in legal actions
      is
      not currently determinable, but could be significant.

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Future
      cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not
      currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for
      PPL
      subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time.

Asbestos

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

There
      have been increasing litigation claims throughout the U.S. based on exposure
      to
      asbestos against companies that manufacture or distribute asbestos products
      or
      that have these products on their premises. Certain of PPL's generation
      subsidiaries and certain of its energy services subsidiaries, such as those
      that
      have supplied, may have supplied or installed asbestos material in connection
      with the repair or installation of process piping and heating, ventilating
      and
      air conditioning systems, have been named as defendants in asbestos-related
      lawsuits. PPL cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or whether additional
      claims may be asserted against its subsidiaries in the future. PPL does not
      expect that the resolution of the current lawsuits will have a material adverse
      effect on its results of operations.

Electric
      and Magnetic Fields

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Concerns
      have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
      effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
      electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
      substation equipment. Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K. have
      reviewed this issue.

The
      U.S.
      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that,
      for
      most health outcomes, there is no evidence of EMFs causing adverse effects.
      The
      agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an
      association with childhood leukemia, but that this evidence is difficult to
      interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. The U.K. National Radiological
      Protection Board concluded in 2004 that, while the research on EMFs does not
      provide a basis to find that EMFs cause any illness, there is a basis to
      consider precautionary measures beyond existing exposure guidelines.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether EMFs cause
      adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce EMFs,
      where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities.
      PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the EMF
      issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the U.S. or
      abroad, and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might incur
      related to the EMF issue.

Lower
      Mt. Bethel

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      August
      2002, the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas issued a decision setting
      the
      permissible noise levels for operation of the Lower Mt. Bethel facility. PPL
      appealed the court's decision to the Commonwealth Court, and an intervenor
      in
      the lawsuit cross-appealed the court's decision. In May 2003, the Commonwealth
      Court remanded the case to the Court of Common Pleas for further findings of
      fact concerning the zoning application relating to the construction of the
      facility. In September 2003, the Court of Common Pleas ruled in PPL's favor
      while also reaffirming its decision on the noise levels, and the intervenor
      appealed this ruling to the Commonwealth Court. In April 2004, the Commonwealth
      Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, and the Supreme Court
      of Pennsylvania has denied the intervenor's Petition for Allowance of Appeal.
      Accordingly, the September 2003 ruling by the Court of Common Pleas is
      final.

The
      certificate of occupancy for the Lower Mt. Bethel facility was issued by the
      local township zoning officer in April 2004, and the facility was placed in
      service in May 2004. In May 2004, the intervenor in the legal proceedings
      regarding the facility's permissible noise levels filed an appeal with the
      township zoning board regarding the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
      The hearing on the appeal was held in December 2004, and the intervenor's appeal
      was denied. The intervenor appealed the zoning board's decision to the
      Northampton County Court of Common Pleas in February 2005, and the Court of
      Common Pleas denied this appeal in August 2005. The intervenor did not further
      appeal this matter. Accordingly, the zoning board's decision is
      final.

WPD's
      distribution businesses are subject to numerous regulatory and statutory
      requirements with respect to environmental matters. PPL believes that WPD has
      taken and continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and
      governmental regulations for the protection of the environment. There are no
      material legal or administrative proceedings pending against WPD with respect
      to
      environmental matters. See "Environmental Matters - Domestic - Electric and
      Magnetic Fields" for a discussion of EMFs.

      PPL
      believes that these affiliates have taken and continue to take measures to
      comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the protection
      of the environment. There are no material legal or administrative proceedings
      pending against PPL's affiliates in Latin America with respect to environmental
      matters.

Other

Nuclear
      Insurance

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      Susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage
      for
      property damage to members' nuclear generating stations. Facilities at the
      Susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses up to $2.75
      billion under these programs. PPL Susquehanna is also a member of an insurance
      program that provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power
      during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified
      conditions. Under the property and replacement power insurance programs, PPL
      Susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers'
      adverse loss experience. At

December 31

,
      2005,
      this maximum assessment was about $38 million.

In
      the
      event of a nuclear incident at the Susquehanna station,

PPL
      Susquehanna's public liability for claims resulting from such incident would
      be
      limited to about $10.8 billion under provisions of The Price Anderson Act
      Amendments under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. PPL Susquehanna is protected
      against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry
      assessment program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors
      covered by The Price Anderson Act Amendments under the Energy Policy Act of
      2005, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $201 million per incident, payable
      at $30 million per year.

Guarantees
      and Other Assurances

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      the
      normal course of business, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric enter into
      agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on
      behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example,
      guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and
      surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into
      primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary
      on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which
      these
      subsidiaries enter.

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL,
      PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric provide certain guarantees that are required
      to
      be disclosed in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
      Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
      of
      Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission
      of FASB Interpretation No. 34." The table below details guarantees provided
      as
      of December 31, 2005.

PPL,
      PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries provide other
      miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course
      of
      business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of various indemnifications
      or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The
      obligated amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and
      the
      overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be
      reasonably estimated. Historically, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
      and
      their subsidiaries have not made any significant payments with respect to these
      types of guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate fair value of these
      indemnifications related to arrangements entered into subsequent to December
      31,
      2002, was insignificant. Among these guarantees are:

PPL,
      on
      behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that
      covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage.
      The coverage requires a $4 million deductible per occurrence and provides
      maximum aggregate coverage of approximately $175 million. This insurance may
      be
      applicable to certain obligations under the contractual arrangements discussed
      above.

      December 31, 2005, and 2004, PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets
      reflect $89 million of "Long-term Debt with Affiliate Trust." This debt
      represents obligations of PPL Energy Supply under 8.23% subordinated debentures
      maturing in February 2027 that are held by SIUK Capital Trust I, which is a
      variable interest entity whose common securities are owned by PPL Energy Supply
      but which is not consolidated by PPL Energy Supply. Interest expense on this
      obligation was $12 million in 2005, $11 million in 2004 and $5 million in 2003.
      This interest is reflected in "Interest Expense" for PPL and "Interest Expense

      for additional information.

PLR
      Contracts

(PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric has power sales agreements with PPL EnergyPlus, effective July 2000
      and
      January 2002, to supply all of PPL Electric's PLR load through 2009. Under
      these
      contracts, PPL EnergyPlus provides electricity at the predetermined capped
      prices that PPL Electric is authorized to charge its PLR customers. These
      purchases totaled $1.6 billion in 2005, $1.5 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion
      in
      2003. These purchases include nuclear decommissioning recovery and amortization
      of an up-front contract payment and are included in the Statement of Income
      as
      "Energy purchases from affiliate" by PPL Electric, and as "Wholesale energy
      marketing to affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply.

Under
      one
      of the PLR contracts, PPL Electric is required to make performance assurance
      deposits with PPL EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than
      the contract price by more than its contract collateral threshold. Conversely,
      PPL EnergyPlus is required to make performance assurance deposits with PPL
      Electric when the market price of electricity is greater than the contract
      price
      by more than its contract collateral threshold. PPL Electric estimated that
      at
      December 31, 2005, the market price of electricity would exceed the contract
      price by approximately $4.2 billion. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005, PPL
      Energy Supply was required to provide PPL Electric with performance assurance
      of
      $300 million, the maximum amount required under the contract. PPL Energy
      Supply's deposit with PPL Electric was $300 million at December 31, 2005 and
      2004. This deposit is shown on the Balance Sheet as "Collateral on PLR energy
      supply to/from affiliate," a current asset of PPL Energy Supply and a current
      liability of PPL Electric. PPL Electric pays interest equal to the one-month
      LIBOR plus 0.5% on this deposit, which is included in "Interest Expense with
      Affiliate" on the Statement of Income. PPL Energy Supply records this as
      interest income, which is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement
      of
      Income.

In
      2001,
      PPL Electric made a $90 million up-front payment to PPL EnergyPlus in connection
      with the PLR contracts. The up-front payment is being amortized by both parties
      over the term of the PLR contracts. The unamortized balance of this payment
      and
      other payments under the contract was $47 million at December 31, 2005, and
      $58
      million at December 31, 2004. These current and noncurrent balances are
      reported on the Balance Sheet as "Prepayment on PLR energy supply from
      affiliate" by PPL Electric and as "Deferred revenue on PLR energy supply to
      affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply.

NUG
      Purchases

(PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Electric has a reciprocal contract with PPL EnergyPlus to sell electricity
      purchased under contracts with NUGs. PPL Electric purchases electricity from
      the
      NUGs at contractual rates and then sells the electricity at the same price
      to
      PPL EnergyPlus. These purchases totaled $148 million in 2005, $154 million
      in
      2004 and $152 million in 2003. These amounts are included in the Statement
      of
      Income as "Wholesale electric to affiliate" by PPL Electric, and as "Energy
      purchases from affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply.

Allocations
      of Corporate Service Costs

(PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources
      and information services. PPL Services bills the respective PPL subsidiaries
      for
      the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. The cost
      of
      these services that is not directly charged to PPL subsidiaries is allocated
      to
      certain of the subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative
      invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses, and number of employees.
      PPL Services allocated the following charges to PPL Energy Supply and PPL
      Electric.

Intercompany
      Borrowings

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

PPL
      Energy Supply had no notes receivable from affiliates at December 31, 2005
      and
      December 31, 2004. Interest earned on cash collateral and loans to affiliates,
      included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of Income, was $15 million,
      $6
      million and $16 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

In
      May
      2004, PPL Energy Supply issued a $495 million note payable to an affiliate.
      There was no balance at December 31, 2005, and there was a balance of $495
      million at December 31, 2004, which is shown on the Balance Sheet as "Note
      Payable to Affiliate," a long-term liability. PPL Energy Supply can borrow
      under
      the note until May 2010. Interest is payable monthly in arrears at LIBOR plus
      1%. Interest expense on this note was $9 million and $8 million for 2005 and
      2004. This interest is reflected in "Interest Expense with Affiliates" on the
      Statement of Income.

In
      late
      December 2005, PPL Energy Supply issued a $30 million demand note payable to
      an
      affiliate. At December 31, 2005, there was a balance of $8 million, which is
      shown on the Balance Sheet as "Note Payable to Affiliate", a current liability.
      Interest is payable monthly at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.5%. Interest on
      this
      note will be reflected in "Interest Expense with Affiliates" on the Statement
      of
      Income.

(

PPL
      Electric)

In
      August
      2004, a PPL Electric subsidiary made a $300 million demand loan to an affiliate,
      with interest due quarterly at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25%.
      This loan is shown on the Balance Sheet as "Note receivable from affiliate."

Interest
      earned on loans to affiliates, included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement
      of Income, was $14 million for 2005, and $3 million for both 2004 and
      2003.

Trademark
      Royalties

(PPL
      Energy Supply)

A
      PPL
      subsidiary owns PPL trademarks and bills certain affiliates for their use.
      PPL
      Energy Supply was allocated $31 million of this license fee in 2005, $34 million
      in 2004 and $39 million in 2003. These allocations of this license fee are
      primarily included in "Other Operation and Maintenance" on the Statement of
      Income.

Other

(PPL
      Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
      Energy Supply owns no domestic transmission or distribution facilities, other
      than facilities to interconnect its generation with the electric transmission
      system. Therefore, PPL EnergyPlus and other PPL Generation subsidiaries must
      pay
      PJM, the operator of the transmission system, to deliver the energy these
      subsidiaries supply to retail and wholesale customers in PPL Electric's
      franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania.

Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
      and
      Hedging Activities," on January 1, 2001. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
      149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
      Activities," which amended and clarified SFAS 133 to improve financial
      accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
      To
      ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for
      similarly, SFAS 149 clarified the circumstances under which a contract with
      an
      initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative, clarified
      when
      a derivative contains a financing component, amended the definition of an
      "underlying" and amended certain other existing pronouncements.

Additionally,
      SFAS 149 placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or
      normal sale exception. SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or
      modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except
      certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when-issued
      securities or other securities that did not yet exist. PPL adopted SFAS 149
      as
      of July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a significant impact
      on
      PPL or PPL Energy Supply.

Management
      of Market Risk Exposures

Market
      risk is the potential loss PPL and PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result
      of
      price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument.
      PPL and PPL Energy Supply are exposed to market risk from:

PPL
      has a
      risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market
      risk
      and counterparty credit risk. The RMC, comprised of senior management and
      chaired by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
      function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the
      risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review
      and approval, validation of transactions and market prices, verification of
      risk
      and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, and daily portfolio reporting,
      including open positions, mark-to-market valuations, and other risk measurement
      metrics.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
      and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize
      unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price, interest
      rate
      and foreign currency volatility. All derivatives are recognized on the balance
      sheet at their fair value, unless they meet SFAS 133 criteria for exclusion
      (see
      discussion in "Accounting Designations" below).

Fair
      Value Hedges

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into financial or physical contracts to hedge a portion
      of the fair value of firm commitments of forward electricity sales and emission
      allowance positions. These contracts range in maturity through 2007.
      Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial contracts to hedge
      fluctuations in the market value of existing debt issuances. These contracts
      range in maturity through


.
      PPL and
      PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
      the exchange rates associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign
      currencies. These forward contracts range in maturity through


.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply did not recognize significant gains or losses resulting from
      hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for
      2005, 2004 or 2003.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply also did not recognize any gains or losses resulting from
      the
      ineffective portion of fair value hedges for these years.

Cash
      Flow Hedges

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical contracts, including
      forwards, futures and swaps, to hedge the price risk associated with electric,
      gas and oil commodities. These contracts range in maturity through 2010.
      Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial interest rate
      swap
      contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and
      anticipated debt issuances. These interest rate swap contracts range in maturity
      through 2016 for PPL. PPL Energy Supply was not a party to any financial
      interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2005. PPL and PPL Energy Supply
      also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the cash flows
      associated with foreign currency-denominated debt, the exchange rates associated
      with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and the net investment
      of foreign operations. These forward contracts range in maturity through 2028.

Net
      investment hedge activity is reported in the foreign currency translation
      adjustments component of other comprehensive income. PPL recorded net investment
      hedge losses, after tax, of $6 million and $7 million as of December 31,
      2005 and 2004.

Cash
      flow
      hedges may be discontinued if it is probable that the original forecasted
      transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period.
      There were no such events in 2005, and there was an insignificant impact from
      such an event in 2004. In 2003, PPL and PPL Energy Supply discontinued certain
      cash flow hedges, which resulted in the reclassification of $7 million of
      after-tax losses from other comprehensive income (reported in "Wholesale energy
      marketing" revenues, "Energy purchases" and "Interest Expense" on the Statement
      of Income).

Hedge
      ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives did not have a significant
      impact in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Ineffectiveness
      associated with interest rate and foreign currency derivatives also was not
      significant for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the deferred net loss, after tax, on derivative instruments
      in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" expected to be reclassified into
      earnings during the next twelve months was $72 million and $67 million for
      PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply. Amounts are reclassified as the energy contracts go
      to
      delivery and interest payments are made.

This
      table shows the change in accumulated unrealized gains or losses on derivatives,
      after tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Accounting
      Designations

For
      energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the circumstances
      and
      intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine
      their accounting designation, which is subsequently verified by an independent
      internal group on a daily basis. The following summarizes the electricity
      guidelines that have been provided to the marketers who are responsible for
      contract designation for derivative energy contracts in accordance with SFAS
      133.

Any
      unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment
      are recorded in other comprehensive income. These unrealized gains and losses
      become realized when the contracts settle and are recognized in income when
      the
      hedged transactions occur.

In
      addition to energy-related transactions, PPL enters into financial interest
      rate
      and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with
      both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL and PPL Energy Supply also
      enter into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm
      commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign
      operations. As with energy transactions, the circumstances and intent existing
      at the time of the transaction determine a contract's accounting designation,
      which is subsequently verified by an independent internal group on a daily
      basis. The following is a summary of certain guidelines that have been provided
      to PPL's finance department, which is responsible for contract
      designation.

Related
      Implementation Issues

In
      November 2003, the FASB revised the guidance in DIG Issue C15, "Scope
      Exceptions: Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Certain Option-Type
      Contracts and Forward Contracts in Electricity," to clarify the application
      of
      derivative accounting rules for contracts that may involve capacity. The
      guidance was effective January 1, 2004, for PPL and did not have a significant
      impact on its financial statements.

In
      June
      2003, the FASB issued DIG Issue C20, "Scope Exceptions: Interpretation of the
      Meaning of Not Clearly and Closely Related in Paragraph 10(b) Regarding
      Contracts with a Price Adjustment Feature," which became effective
      October 1, 2003. DIG Issue C20 addresses a requirement in SFAS 133 that
      contracts that qualify for normal treatment must feature pricing that is clearly
      and closely related to the asset being sold. Diversity in practice had developed
      among companies. DIG Issue C20 permits normal treatment if a price adjustment
      factor, such as a broad market index (e.g., Consumer Price Index), is not
      extraneous to both the cost and the fair value of the asset being sold and
      is
      not significantly disproportionate in terms of the magnitude and direction
      when
      compared with the asset being sold. However, DIG Issue C20 also stated that
      prior guidance did not permit the use of a broad market index to serve as a
      proxy for an ingredient or direct factor. Thus, DIG Issue C20 required that
      contracts that had been accounted for as normal, but were not eligible for
      normal treatment under prior guidance, be reflected on the balance sheet at
      their fair value, with an offsetting amount reflected in income as of the date
      of adoption. These contracts could then be evaluated under the provisions of
      DIG
      Issue C20 to determine whether they could qualify for normal treatment
      prospectively. PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a pre-tax charge to income
      of
      $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to comply with the provisions of DIG
      Issue C20.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply adopted the final provisions of EITF 03-11, "Reporting
      Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB
      Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No.
      02-3," prospectively as of October 1, 2003. As a result of this adoption,
      non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points
      are
      netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points.
      A
      major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available.
      The impact of adopting EITF 03-11 was a reduction in both "Wholesale energy
      marketing" revenues and "Energy purchases" by $290 million in PPL's and PPL
      Energy Supply's Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005,
      and a
      reduction of $277 million and $105 million for the years ended December 31,
      2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.

Credit
      Concentration

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply enter into contracts with many entities for the purchase
      and
      sale of energy. Many of these contracts are considered a normal part of doing
      business and, as such, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is not
      reflected in the financial statements. However, the mark-to-market value of
      these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit
      perspective.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply have credit exposures to energy trading partners. The majority
      of these exposures are the mark-to-market value of multi-year contracts for
      energy sales and purchases. Therefore, if these counterparties fail to perform
      their obligations under such contracts, PPL and PPL Energy Supply would not
      experience an immediate financial loss but would experience lower revenues
      or
      higher costs in future years to the extent that replacement sales or purchases
      could not be made at the same prices as those under the defaulted
      contracts.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL had a credit exposure of $559 million to energy trading
      partners. Ten counterparties accounted for 72% of this exposure. No other
      individual counterparty accounted for more than 2% of the exposure. Nine of
      the
      ten counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from S&P. One
      counterparty was not investment grade but was current on its obligations and
      has
      posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit equal to PPL's exposure.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply had a credit exposure of $554 million
      to
      energy trading partners. Ten counterparties accounted for 72% of this exposure.
      No other individual counterparty accounted for more than 2% of the exposure.
      Nine of the ten counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from
      S&P. One counterparty was not investment grade but was current on its
      obligations and has posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit equal
      to
      PPL Energy Supply's exposure.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply generally have the right to request collateral from their
      counterparties in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below
      investment grade. It is also the policy of PPL and PPL Energy Supply to enter
      into netting agreements with all of their counterparties to minimize credit
      exposure.

(PPL
      Electric)

Prior
      to
      2004, PPL Energy Supply had an exposure to PPL Electric under the long-term
      contract for PPL EnergyPlus to provide PPL Electric's PLR load. However,
      beginning in 2004, increases in electricity prices reversed this position.
      PPL
      Electric estimates that, at December 31, 2005, the market price of electricity
      would exceed the contract price by approximately $4.2 billion. In accordance
      with the terms of one of the PLR contracts, PPL Energy Supply provided PPL
      Electric with cash collateral in the amount of $300 million, the maximum amount
      required under the contract. This is the only credit exposure for PPL Electric
      that has a mark-to-market element. No other counterparty accounts for more
      than
      1% of PPL Electric's total exposure.

Goodwill
      and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Goodwill
      by segment at December 31 was:

In
      2005,
      the decrease of $57 million in the International Delivery segment was
      attributable to a decrease of $60 million due to the effect of changes in
      foreign currency exchange rates, offset by $3 million of adjustments pursuant
      to
      EITF Issue 93-7, "Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase Business
      Combination."

In
      2004,
      the increase of $58 million in the International Delivery segment was
      attributable to an increase of $93 million due to the effect of changes in
      foreign currency exchange rates, offset by $35 million consisting primarily
      of
      adjustments pursuant to EITF Issue No. 93-7.

In
      December 2003, the PPL Global Board of Managers authorized the sale of its
      investment in a Latin American telecommunications company. As a result of this
      decision, PPL Global wrote off $6 million of goodwill in 2003.

      effort to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, PPL and its
      subsidiaries commenced a workforce reduction assessment in June 2002. The
      program was broad-based and impacted all employee groups, except certain
      positions that are key to providing high-quality service to PPL's electricity
      delivery customers.

PPL
      and
      PPL Electric recorded a final charge of $9 million, or $5 million after tax,
      in
      2003. This final charge included employee terminations associated with
      implementation of the Automated Meter Reading project.

The
      program provided primarily for enhanced early retirement benefits and/or
      one-time special pension separation allowances based on an employee's age and
      years of service. These features of the program were paid from the PPL
      Retirement Plan pension trust. All of the accrued non-pension benefits have
      been
      paid.

Asset
      Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

In
      connection with the adoption of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
      Obligations," effective January 1, 2003, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded
      a
      cumulative effect of adoption that increased net income by $63 million (net
      of
      tax of $44 million), or $0.18 per share.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply identified various legal obligations to retire long-lived
      assets, the largest of which relates to the decommissioning of the Susquehanna
      plant. PPL and PPL Energy Supply identified and recorded other AROs related
      to
      significant interim retirements at the Susquehanna plant, and various
      environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin
      retirements at Susquehanna and other facilities.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations that could not
      be
      reasonably estimated at that time. These items included requirements associated
      with the retirement of a reservoir and certain transmission assets. These
      retirement obligations could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable
      settlement dates.

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset
      Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN 47
      clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair
      value
      of a conditional ARO when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be
      reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
      information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply adopted FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005. Adoption of the
      new guidance resulted in an increase in net PP&E of $4 million, recognition
      of AROs of $17 million, recognition of deferred tax assets of $5 million and
      a
      cumulative effect of adoption that decreased net income by $8 million (net
      of
      tax of $6 million), or $0.02 per share.

PPL
      and
      PPL Energy Supply identified several conditional AROs. The most significant
      of
      these related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing material at
      various generation plants. The fair value of the portion of these obligations
      that could be reasonably estimated was recorded at December 31, 2005, and
      resulted in AROs of $14 million and a cumulative effect of adoption that
      decreased net income by $8 million.

Also,
      PPL
      Global identified and recorded conditional AROs that related to treated wood
      poles and fluid-filled cable, which had an insignificant impact on the financial
      statements.

In
      addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but were
      unable to reasonably estimate their fair values. These retirement obligations
      could not be reasonably estimated due to their indeterminable settlement dates.
      The generation plants, where significant amounts of asbestos-containing material
      are located, have been well maintained, and large capital and environmental
      investments are being made at these plants. During the last five years, the
      useful lives of the plants have been reviewed and in most cases significantly
      extended. See Note 1 for further discussion related to the extension of the
      useful lives of these assets. Due to these circumstances, PPL management was
      unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates
      for
      the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at the generation
      plants. If economic events or other circumstances change that enable PPL and
      PPL
      Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement
      obligations, they will be recorded at that time.

The
      changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were:

The
      pro
      forma ARO liability balances calculated as if FIN 47 had been adopted on January
      1, 2003, would not have been significantly different than those calculated
      at
      December 31, 2005.

The
      pro
      forma income statement effects, including the effects on income from continuing
      operations, net income, and basic and diluted EPS, from the application of
      FIN
      47 calculated as if it had been adopted prior to January 1, 2003, also would
      have been insignificant for 2003, 2004 and 2005.

(PPL
      Electric)

PPL
      Electric adopted SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003, and FIN 47 effective
      December 31, 2005. PPL Electric did not record any AROs upon adoption of either
      of these standards.  PPL Electric identified legal retirement obligations
      for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably
      estimated at this time due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets
      are
      located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to
      relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the
      grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when this
      event
      may occur.

Nuclear

Decommissioning

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

The
      expected cost to decommission the Susquehanna plant is based on a 2002
      site-specific study that estimated the cost to dismantle and decommission each
      unit immediately following final shutdown. PPL Susquehanna's 90% share of the
      total estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna plant was approximately
      $936 million measured in 2002 dollars. This estimate includes decommissioning
      the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal of
      non-radiological structures and materials.

Beginning
      in January 1999, in accordance with the PUC Final Order, approximately $130
      million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from PPL Electric's
      customers through the CTC over the 11-year life of the CTC rather than the
      remaining life of Susquehanna. The recovery includes a return on unamortized
      decommissioning costs. Under the power supply agreements between PPL Electric
      and PPL EnergyPlus, these revenues are passed on to PPL EnergyPlus. Similarly,
      these revenues are passed on to PPL Susquehanna under a power supply agreement
      between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Susquehanna.

Accretion
      expense, as determined under the provisions of SFAS 143, was $19 million in
      2005, $18 million in 2004 and $16 million in 2003, and is included in "Other
      operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income. Accrued nuclear
      decommissioning expenses, as determined under the provisions of SFAS 143, were
      $255 million and $236 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and are
      included in "Asset Retirement Obligations" on the Balance Sheet.

Amounts
      collected from PPL Electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable
      taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only be
      used
      for future decommissioning costs. To the extent that the actual costs for
      decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds,
      PPL Susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the shortfall.

Investments
      in the trust funds for decommissioning the nuclear plant are classified as
      available-for-sale. The following tables show the fair values and gross
      unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses for the securities held in the
      trust funds.

At
      December 31, 2005, PPL Susquehanna's nuclear decommissioning trust funds
      contained investments with an aggregate unrealized loss position of
      approximately $4 million, of which $2 million was attributable to investments
      with an aggregate fair value of approximately $69 million that have been in
      a
      continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and $2 million
      was
      attributable to investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $40
      million that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months
      or
      longer. The equity securities' unrealized loss position consists of 132
      investments with an aggregate fair value of $20 million and an average
      unrealized loss of 7%. The largest unrealized loss for any individual investment
      was $387 thousand, which represents a decrease in value of only 15%. The minor
      decline in the value of government securities is primarily due to the impact
      of
      interest rates, as such securities are essentially free of credit risk.
      Currently, PPL Susquehanna believes it is reasonable to expect these securities
      to recover from this temporary decline in value.

At
      December 31, 2004, PPL Susquehanna's nuclear decommissioning trust funds
      contained investments with an aggregate unrealized loss position of
      approximately $3 million, of which $1 million was attributable to investments
      with an aggregate fair value of approximately $56 million that had been in
      a
      continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and $2 million
      was
      attributable to investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $29
      million that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months
      or
      longer. The minor decline in the value of government securities is primarily
      due
      to the impact of interest rates, as such securities are essentially free of
      credit risk.

Of
      the
      $139 million of government obligations and other debt securities held at
      December 31, 2005, $3 million mature within one year, $45 million mature after
      one year through five years, $43 million mature after five years through ten
      years and $48 million mature after ten years.

The
      following table shows proceeds from and realized gains and losses on sales
      of
      securities held in the trust.

(a)

                includes a $(10) million adjustment to the net realized gains recorded
                in
                2003. The adjustment was included in gross realized losses in this
                table.

The
      proceeds from the sales of securities are reinvested in the trust. These funds,
      along with deposits of amounts collected from customers, are used to pay income
      taxes and fees related to managing the trust. Due to the restricted nature
      of
      these investments, they are not included in cash and cash
      equivalents.

Variable
      Interest Entities

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
      January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable
      Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 clarified that
      variable interest entities, as defined therein, that do not disperse risks
      among
      the parties involved should be consolidated by the entity that is determined
      to
      be the primary beneficiary. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 by issuing
      Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable
      Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," which is known as FIN
      46(R)
      and replaces FIN 46. FIN 46(R) does not change the general consolidation
      concepts of FIN 46. Among other things, FIN 46(R) clarifies certain provisions
      of FIN 46 and provides additional scope exceptions for certain types of
      businesses. FIN 46 applied immediately to variable interest entities created
      after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise
      obtained an interest after January 31, 2003. FIN 46(R) provides that a public
      entity that is not a small business issuer (i) should apply FIN 46 or FIN 46(R)
      to entities that are considered to be SPEs no later than the end of the first
      reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003 and (ii) should apply
      the provisions of FIN 46(R) to all entities no later than the end of the first
      reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004.

As
      permitted by FIN 46(R), PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 46 effective
      December 31, 2003, for entities created before February 1, 2003, that are
      considered to be SPEs. This adoption resulted in the consolidation of the
      lessors under the operating leases for the Sundance, University Park and Lower
      Mt. Bethel generation facilities, as well as the deconsolidation of two wholly
      owned trusts. See below for further discussion. Also, as permitted by FIN 46(R),
      PPL and its subsidiaries deferred the application of FIN 46 for other entities
      and adopted FIN 46(R) for all entities on March 31, 2004. The adoption of FIN
      46(R) did not have a material impact on the results of PPL and its
      subsidiaries.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

Additional
      Entities Consolidated

In
      May
      2001, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a lease arrangement, as
      lessee, for the development, construction and operation of commercial power
      generation facilities. The lessor was created for the sole purpose of owning
      the
      facilities and incurring the related financing costs. The $660 million operating
      lease arrangement covered the 450 MW gas-fired Sundance project located in
      Pinal
      County, Arizona and the 540 MW gas-fired University Park project near University
      Park, Illinois. These facilities were substantially complete in July 2002,
      at
      which time the initial lease term commenced. In June 2004, PPL Energy Supply
      subsidiaries purchased the Sundance and University Park generation assets from
      the lessor. In May 2005, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply completed the sale
      of
      its Sundance generation assets to Arizona Public Service Company. See Note
      9 for
      further discussion of the sale.

In
      December 2001, another subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a $455
      million operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development,
      construction and operation of a 582 MW gas-fired combined-cycle generation
      facility located in Lower Mt. Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.
      The lessor was created for the sole purpose of owning the facilities and
      incurring the related financing costs. The initial lease term commenced on
      the
      date of commercial operation, which occurred in May 2004, and ends in December
      2013. The lease financing, which is included in "Long-term Debt," is secured
      by,
      among other things, the generation facility. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      the
      facility had a carrying value of $459 million and $470 million, net of
      accumulated depreciation and amortization of $25 million and $10 million, and
      was included in "Property, Plant and Equipment" and "Other acquired intangibles"
      on the Balance Sheet.

PPL
      Energy Supply was required to consolidate the financial statements of the
      lessors under the operating leases for the Sundance, University Park and Lower
      Mt. Bethel generation facilities effective December 31, 2003, since it was
      the
      primary beneficiary of these entities. Upon initial consolidation, PPL Energy
      Supply recognized a charge of $27 million (net of a tax benefit of $18 million)
      as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Entities
      Deconsolidated

Effective
      December 31, 2003, PPL deconsolidated PPL Capital Funding Trust I, and PPL
      Energy Supply deconsolidated SIUK Capital Trust I. These trusts were
      deconsolidated because PPL and PPL Energy Supply were not the primary
      beneficiaries of the trusts under interpretations of FIN 46. The deconsolidation
      of the trusts did not impact the earnings of PPL and PPL Energy Supply. See
      below for a discussion of PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's interest in the trusts.
      See Note 15 for a discussion of the presentation of the related party
      debt.

(PPL)

In
      May
      2001, PPL and PPL Capital Funding Trust I, a wholly owned financing subsidiary
      of PPL, issued $575 million of 7.75% PEPS Units. Each PEPS Unit consisted of
      (i)
      a contract to purchase shares of PPL common stock on or prior to May 2004 and
      (ii) a trust preferred security of PPL Capital Funding Trust I with a maturity
      date of May 2006. The trust's sole source of funds for distributions were from
      payments of interest on 7.29% subordinated notes of PPL Capital Funding, due
      May
      18, 2006, that were issued to the trust. PPL guaranteed the payment of principal
      and interest on the subordinated notes issued to the trust by PPL Capital
      Funding. PPL also fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the trust's
      obligations under the trust preferred securities. All of the preferred
      securities of PPL Capital Funding Trust I were cancelled in 2004, and the trust
      was terminated in June 2004.

(PPL
      and PPL Energy Supply)

SIUK
      Capital Trust I issued $82 million of 8.23% preferred securities maturing in
      February 2027 and invested the proceeds in 8.23% subordinated debentures
      maturing in February 2027 issued by SIUK Limited. Thus, the preferred securities
      are supported by a corresponding amount of subordinated debentures. SIUK Limited
      owned all of the common securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and guaranteed all
      of
      SIUK Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities. In January
      2003, SIUK Limited transferred its assets and liabilities, including the common
      securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and the obligations under the subordinated
      debentures, to WPD LLP. Therefore, WPD LLP currently guarantees all of SIUK
      Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities. SIUK Capital
      Trust
      I may, at the discretion of WPD LLP, redeem the preferred securities, in whole
      or in part, at 104.115% of par beginning February 2007 and thereafter at an
      annually declining premium over par through January 2017, after which time
      they
      are redeemable at par.

New
      Accounting Standards

(PPL,
      PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

SFAS
      123(R)

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment,"
      which is known as SFAS 123(R) and replaces SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation," as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." Among other things, SFAS 123(R)
      eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting
      for
      stock-based compensation. SFAS 123(R) requires public entities to recognize
      compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on
      the
      grant-date fair value of the awards. SFAS 123(R) was originally effective for
      public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning
      of the first interim or annual period that begins after June 15, 2005. However,
      in April 2005, the SEC issued a rule that amended Regulation S-X to change
      this
      effective date to the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins on or
      after June 15, 2005.

SFAS
      123(R) requires public entities to apply the modified prospective application
      transition method of adoption. Under this application, entities must recognize
      compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value for new awards granted
      or modified after the effective date and for unvested awards outstanding on
      the
      effective date. Additionally, public entities may choose to apply modified
      retrospective application to periods before the effective date of SFAS 123(R).
      This application may be applied either to all prior years for which SFAS 123
      was
      effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption
      of
      SFAS 123(R). Under modified retrospective application, prior periods would
      be
      adjusted to recognize compensation expense as though stock-based awards granted,
      modified or settled in cash in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994,
      had been accounted for under SFAS 123.

PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. PPL and its
      subsidiaries will not apply modified retrospective application to any periods
      prior to the date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) is not expected
      to
      have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries, since PPL and its
      subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
      compensation, as described by SFAS 123, effective January 1, 2003.

SFAS

In
      February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140." Among
      other items, SFAS 155 addresses certain accounting issues surrounding
      securitized financial assets and hybrid financial instruments with embedded
      derivatives that require bifurcation. PPL and its subsidiaries must adopt SFAS
      155 no later than January 1, 2007. PPL and its subsidiaries are currently in
      the
      process of performing a complete assessment of SFAS 155. However, since PPL
      and
      its subsidiaries do not have any interests in securitized financial assets
      or
      hybrid financial instruments with embedded derivatives that require bifurcation,
      the impact from the adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to be
      material.

      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the independent registered public accounting
      firm for PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric. The registrants had previously
      announced that the Audit Committee of PPL's Board of Directors (the Audit

      reports on the financial statements of the registrants for the fiscal years
      ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, did not contain any adverse opinion or a
      disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to
      uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. During the fiscal years ended
      December 31, 2004 and 2005, and through March 3, 2006, (1) there were no
      disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
      financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not
      resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference
      thereto in its reports on the financial statements of the registrants for such
      years, and (2) there have been no "reportable events" as defined in Item
      304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Also
      as
      previously announced, on November 10, 2005, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst
      & Young LLP (Ernst & Young) as the independent registered public
      accounting firm for the registrants as of and for the fiscal year ending
      December 31, 2006. This appointment followed a solicitation and review process
      conducted by PPL pursuant to the Audit Committee's previously announced policy
      to solicit competitive proposals for audit services from independent accounting
      firms at least once every seven years. During the fiscal years ended December
      31, 2004 and 2005, and prior to its engagement, (1) Ernst & Young had not
      been engaged as the principal accountant of the registrants to audit their
      financial statements or as an independent accountant to audit a significant
      subsidiary of the registrants, and (2) none of the registrants had consulted
      with Ernst & Young regarding (a) the application of accounting principles to
      any completed or proposed transaction, (b) the type of audit opinion that might
      be rendered on the registrants' financial statements for such periods, or (c)
      any other accounting, auditing or financial reporting matter described in Items
      304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

      annual financial statements and for fees billed for other services rendered
      by
      PwC.

Approval
      of Fees

The
      Audit
      Committee of PPL has procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services
      to be provided by the independent auditor. The procedures are designed to ensure
      the continued independence of the independent auditor. More specifically, the
      use of the independent auditor to perform either audit or non-audit services
      is
      prohibited unless specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee of
      PPL. As a result of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL has
      established specific categories of services and authorization levels. All
      services outside of the specified categories and all amounts exceeding the
      authorization levels are reviewed by the Chair of the Audit Committee of PPL,
      who serves as the Committee designee to review and approve audit and non-audit
      related services during the year. A listing of the approved audit and non-audit
      services is reviewed with the full Audit Committee of PPL no later than its
      next
      meeting.

The
      Audit
      Committee of PPL approved 100% of the 2005 and 2004 audit and non-audit related
      fees.
