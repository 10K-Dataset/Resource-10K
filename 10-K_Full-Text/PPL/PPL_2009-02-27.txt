FORWARD-LOOKING

INFORMATION

Statements
contained in this Form 10-K concerning expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
goals, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions and
other statements which are other than statements of historical facts are
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.  Although PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric believe that
the expectations and assumptions reflected in these statements are reasonable,
there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to be
correct.  Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results
discussed in forward-looking statements.  In addition to the specific
factors discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and in "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the
following are among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Any such
forward-looking statements should be considered in light of such important
factors and in conjunction with other documents of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and
PPL Electric on file with the SEC.

New
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in forward-looking statements emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for PPL, PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric to predict all of such
factors, or the extent to which any such factor or combination of factors may
cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking
statement.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date
on which such statement is made, and PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
undertake no obligation to update the information contained in such statement to
reflect subsequent developments or information.

arrangements for fuel.

A
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply develops renewable energy plants on various
sites using technologies such as small turbines, reciprocating engines and
photovoltaic solar panels.  As of December 31, 2008, another
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply owned approximately 32 MW of installed
capacity from these projects, serving commercial and industrial
customers.

PPL
Generation's subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal,
regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to air and water
quality, land use and other environmental matters.  PPL Susquehanna is
subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection with the operation of the
Susquehanna units.  Certain of PPL Generation's other subsidiaries,
including PPL Montana, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC in connection
with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and
density monitoring devices.

Certain
operations of PPL Generation's subsidiaries are subject to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state statutes.

Energy
      Marketing

PPL
EnergyPlus markets or brokers the electricity produced by PPL Generation
subsidiaries, along with purchased power, FTRs, natural gas, oil, emission
allowances and renewable energy credits in competitive wholesale and deregulated
retail markets in order to take advantage of opportunities in the competitive
energy marketplace.

PPL
EnergyPlus purchases and sells electric capacity and energy at the wholesale
level at competitive prices under FERC market-based prices.  PPL
EnergyPlus enters into these agreements to market available energy and capacity
from PPL Generation's assets and to profit from market price
fluctuations.  PPL EnergyPlus actively manages its portfolios to
maximize the value of PPL's generating assets and to limit exposure to price
fluctuations.  PPL EnergyPlus also purchases and sells energy forward
and futures contracts as well as other commodity-based financial instruments in
accordance with PPL's risk management policies, objectives and
strategies.

PPL
EnergyPlus has executed contracts to provide electricity to PPL Electric
sufficient for it to meet its PLR obligation through 2009, at the predetermined
capped rates PPL Electric is entitled to charge its customers during this
period.  This arrangement with PPL Electric accounted for 28% of PPL
Energy Supply's operating revenues in 2008.  See Note 16 to the
Financial Statements for more information concerning these
contracts.

PPL
EnergyPlus currently is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers
in Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.  In 2008, PPL EnergyPlus provided energy to industrial
customers in Montana.  PPL EnergyPlus serves natural gas customers in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware and is licensed to do so in
Maryland.

An
indirect subsidiary of PPL EnergyPlus owned two production facilities that,
until December 31, 2007, manufactured synthetic fuel from coal or coal
byproducts.  PPL received federal tax credits for these qualified
manufactured solid synthetic fuel products.  PPL retired these
facilities in 2008.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

In 2007,
PPL sold PPL Telcom, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of PPL EnergyPlus, which
offered fiber optic capacity to telecommunication companies and enterprise
customers.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

Pennsylvania Delivery
      Segment -

Includes
      the regulated electric delivery operations of PPL
  Electric.

PPL
      Electric

PPL
Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a
10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  The largest cities in this territory are Allentown,
Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Hazleton, Lancaster, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and
Williamsport.

In
addition to delivering electricity in its service territory in Pennsylvania, PPL
Electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory
as a PLR.  As part of the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to
supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through
2009.  PPL Electric has executed two contracts to purchase electricity
from PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates.  PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant to PLR regulations
and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those
regulations.  Both the regulations and the policy statement became
effective in September 2007.  Refer to "Power Supply" for additional
information, as well as Notes 15 and 16 to the Financial
Statements.

During
2008, about 97% of PPL Electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated
electricity delivery and supply as a PLR.  About 3% of 2008 operating
revenues were from wholesale revenues, primarily the sale to PPL EnergyPlus of
power purchased from NUGs.  During 2008, about 45% of electricity
delivery and PLR revenues were from residential customers, 36% from commercial
customers, 18% from industrial customers and 1% from other customer
classes.

PPL
Electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of PJM, which operates
the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-Atlantic
and Midwest regions of the U.S.  Bulk electricity is transmitted to
wholesale users throughout a geographic area including all or part of Delaware,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia.  As of January 1, 2006, PPL Electric became a member of the
RFC.  The purpose of the RFC is to preserve and enhance electric
service reliability and security for the interconnected electric systems within
its territory and to be a regional entity under the framework of the
NERC.  The RFC's key functions are the development of regional
standards for reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and
non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both NERC and
regional standards.

PJM
serves as a FERC-approved RTO in order to accommodate greater competition and
broader participation in the region.  An RTO, like an ISO, is a
designation provided by the FERC to a FERC-approved independent entity that
operates the transmission system and typically administers a competitive power
market.  PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity
and ancillary services.  A primary purpose of the RTO/ISO is to
separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market
participants that buy or sell electricity in the same
markets.  Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets,
but the RTO/ISO directs the control and operation of the transmission
facilities.  PPL Electric is entitled to fully recover from retail
customers the charges that it pays to PJM for transmission-related
services.  PJM imposes these charges pursuant to its FERC-approved
Open Access Transmission Tariff.

PPL
Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain of
its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal
Power Act.

PPL
Electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state
and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental
matters.  Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state
statutes.

In
November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard
(the AEPS) legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as
PPL Electric, and retail electric suppliers serving retail load to ultimately
provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from
alternative sources by 2020.  Under this state legislation,
alternative sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and
fuel cells.  An electric distribution company will pay an alternative
compliance payment of $45 for each MWh that it is short of its required
alternative energy supply percentage.  Since PPL Electric's PLR
generation rates are capped through 2009 as described above and the legislation
allows for a cost recovery exemption period, PPL Electric will not be subject to
the requirements of this legislation until 2010.  In that year, PPL
Electric will have to supply about 9% of the total amount of electricity it
delivers to its PLR customers from alternative energy sources.  PPL
Electric is purchasing all of the supply required to meet its 2010 default
service obligations pursuant to a PUC approved Competitive Bridge Plan (the
Plan).  Under the Plan, PPL Electric is obtaining full requirements
service which includes the generation or credits that PPL Electric will need to
comply with the AEPS Act in 2010.  At this time, PPL Electric cannot
predict the impact of this legislation on its future results of operations
because the impact will depend on a number of factors that will not be known
until 2010, including customer load requirements, PLR contract terms and
available alternative energy sources in the market.

The
General Assembly passed and the Governor signed into law Act 129 in October
2008.  The law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program
and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new PLR electricity supply
procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to
the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard.

See
"Regulatory Issues - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for additional information regarding Act 129, other legislative
and regulatory impacts and PPL Electric's efforts to provide default electricity
supply for periods after 2009.

PPL Gas
      Utilities

Until its
sale in October 2008, PPL Gas Utilities operated a natural gas distribution and
propane business which provided natural gas and propane services to
approximately 110,000 customers in various counties throughout Pennsylvania, as
well as in a small area of Maryland and Delaware.  See Note 10 to the
Financial Statements for information on the sale of PPL Gas
Utilities.

·

International Delivery
      Segment -

Includes
      WPD, a regulated electricity distribution company in the
    U.K.

WPD,
through indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, operates two of the 15 distribution
networks providing electricity service in the U.K.  The WPD
subsidiaries together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users in the
U.K.  WPD (South West) serves 1.5 million customers in a 5,560 square
mile area of southwest England.  WPD (South Wales) serves an area of
Wales opposite the Bristol Channel from WPD (South West)'s
territory.  Its 1.1 million customers occupy 4,550 square miles of
Wales.  WPD is headquartered in Bristol, England.  See
"Franchise and Licenses" for additional information about WPD's regulator,
Ofgem, which sets price controls and grants distribution licenses.

PPL
Global had controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution
companies serving customers in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia until their
respective sales in 2007.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on these sales.

Seasonality

Demand
for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather.  As a
result, PPL's overall operating results in the future may fluctuate
substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather
conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more
pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on
the nature and location of the facilities PPL owns and the terms of the
contracts to purchase or sell electricity.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION

See
PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this
information.

CAPITAL
EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

See
"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in PPL's, PPL Energy
Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning
estimated capital expenditure requirements for the years
2009-2013.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
information concerning expected capital expenditures for environmental
matters.

COMPETITION

The
unregulated businesses and markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate
are highly competitive.  Since the early 1990s, there has been
increased competition in U.S. energy markets because of federal and state
deregulation initiatives.  For instance, in 1992 the Energy Act
amended the Federal Power Act to provide open access to electric transmission
systems for wholesale transactions.  In 1996, the Customer Choice Act
was enacted in Pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry
to create a competitive market for electricity generation.  Certain
other states in which PPL's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer
choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity
supplier.  PPL and its subsidiaries believe that competition in
deregulated energy markets will continue to be intense.  See "Item 1A.
Risk Factors" for more information concerning the risks PPL faces with respect
to competition in the deregulated energy markets.

Pursuant
to PPL Electric's authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service
area.  Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its
electricity distribution business.  Although WPD operates in
non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little
competition with respect to residential customers.  See "Franchises
and Licenses" for more information.

POWER
SUPPLY

PPL
Energy Supply's owned or controlled system capacity (winter rating) at
December 31, 2008 was 12,002 MW.  The capacity of generating
units is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and
physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect
changed circumstances.  See "Item 2. Properties" for a description of
PPL Energy Supply's plants at December 31, 2008.

During
2008, PPL Generation's plants generated the following amounts of
electricity.

State

Millions of
      kWh

Pennsylvania

44,189

Montana

8,179

Maine


Illinois


New
      York


Connecticut


Total

53,181

Of this
generation, 52% of the energy was from coal-fired stations, 32% from nuclear
operations at the Susquehanna station, 8% from hydroelectric stations and 8%
from oil/gas-fired stations.

PPL
Energy Supply estimates that, on average, approximately 95% of its expected
annual generation output for 2009 will be used to meet:

·

PPL
      EnergyPlus's obligation under two contracts to provide electricity for PPL
      Electric to satisfy its PLR obligation under the Customer Choice Act
      through 2009;

·

PPL
      EnergyPlus's obligation under contracts to provide electricity to
      NorthWestern; and

·

contractual
      sales to other counterparties for terms of various
  lengths.

PPL
Energy Supply is continuing to enter into new power sales contracts to obtain
firm commitments for a portion of the output of its generating facilities in
advance of the expiration of the PLR contracts at the end of
2009.  PPL Energy Supply has already entered into commitments of
varying quantities and terms for the years 2010 and beyond.  Based on
developments in the wholesale markets over the last several years, PPL Energy
Supply expects that new baseload output contracts are likely to continue to be
of a shorter duration than the PLR contracts which, at inception, had terms of
approximately nine years.

These
contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are integral to, PPL Energy
Supply's supply business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to
adverse movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit
risk.  This strategy includes matching PPL Energy Supply's anticipated
energy supply (including generation as well as purchase commitments) with load,
or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy
counterparties.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more
information regarding PPL Energy Supply's wholesale energy commitments and Note
16 for more information regarding the PLR contracts.

A
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply funds, develops, constructs, owns and operates
plants that produce renewable energy.  PPL EnergyPlus markets the
energy produced by these plants and renewable energy credits to commercial,
industrial and institutional customers.  Another subsidiary of PPL
Energy Supply has existing renewable energy projects throughout Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with capacity of
32 MW.  During 2008, these projects generated 62 million
kWh.

PPL
EnergyPlus purchases the output from two wind farms in Pennsylvania with a
combined capacity of 50 MW.

FUEL
SUPPLY

Coal

Pennsylvania

PPL
Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, actively manages PPL's coal
requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and
northern Appalachia.

During
2008, PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, purchased about
95% of the coal delivered to PPL Generation's wholly-owned Pennsylvania stations
under short-term and long-term contracts and obtained 5% through spot market
purchases.  These contracts provided PPL Generation 6.9 million tons
of coal.  Contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.5
million tons in 2009.  At December 31, 2008, the wholly-owned
Pennsylvania plants had sufficient supply for approximately 39 days of
operations.  The amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time
depending on market conditions and plant operations.

In 2006,
PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, entered into a
long-term coal purchase agreement with CONSOL Energy Inc.  The
contract will provide more than one-third of PPL Generation's projected annual
coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2010 through
2018.  PPL Generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide
additional coal supply for PPL's projected annual needs from 2009 through
2012.

Also at
December 31, 2008, a PPL Generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in the
Keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station.  The
Keystone station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for its coal
requirements.  In 2008, Keystone Fuels, LLC provided 5.3 million tons
of coal to the Keystone station.  The Conemaugh station requirements
are purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels, LLC.  In 2008,
Conemaugh Fuels, LLC provided 4.7 million tons of coal to the Conemaugh
station.

Initial
deliveries of limestone in preparation for startup of the scrubbers that were
being installed at the Montour power plant began in October 2007.  The
Montour scrubber project was completed in May 2008.  Contracts are in
place for all the limestone requirements for the three remaining planned
scrubbers at PPL Generation's wholly-owned Pennsylvania stations through
2010.  When all four scrubbers are fully operational, it is projected
that annual limestone requirements will be approximately 700,000
tons.  During 2008, approximately 350,000 tons of limestone was
delivered to PPL Generation's wholly-owned Pennsylvania stations under long-term
contracts.

Montana

PPL
Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30%
leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3.  PPL Montana, along with the
other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements
with defined quality characteristics and specifications.  The current
coal supply contract for Units 1 and 2 is in effect through December 31,
2009.  In 2007, PPL Montana entered into a new long-term purchase and
supply agreement with the current supplier for Units 1 and 2 that will begin
January 1, 2010.  The new contract will provide these units with 100%
of the coal requirements through December 31, 2014, and at least 85% of such
requirements from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019.  The coal
supply contract for Unit 3 is in effect through December 31, 2019, and will
provide 100% of the coal requirements of this unit.

Coal
supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality
characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette
station.  The contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements
in 2008.  Similar contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of
the expected coal requirements through 2010.

Oil and Natural
Gas

PPL
Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural
gas.  PPL EnergyPlus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural
gas supply for all PPL Generation operations.  During 2008, 100% of
the physical oil and gas requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased
on the spot market.  At December 31, 2008, PPL EnergyPlus had no
long-term agreements for these oil requirements.

At
December 31, 2008, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to
purchase natural gas for the University Park facility in Illinois.

PPL
EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected
pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility in Connecticut,
but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural
gas.

PPL
EnergyPlus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place
for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel
facility in Pennsylvania, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to
purchase natural gas.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the
Ironwood facility.  PPL EnergyPlus has a short-term transportation
contract in place for approximately 10% of the maximum daily requirements of the
Ironwood facility for natural gas and has signed "precedent agreements" for
long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of Ironwood's
maximum daily requirements.  PPL EnergyPlus currently has no long-term
physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for Ironwood.

Nuclear

The
nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service
components:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium
concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a
gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel
assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage
and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

PPL
Susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates,
for nuclear fuel materials and services.  These contracts are expected
to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of
2016 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2015.  PPL
Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued
operation of the nuclear units.

Federal
law requires the U.S. government to provide for the permanent disposal of
commercial spent nuclear fuel.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
(NWPA), the DOE carried out an analysis of a site in Nevada for a permanent
nuclear waste repository.  There is no definitive date by which this
repository will be operational.  As a result, it was necessary to
expand Susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity.  To support
this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a
spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage
technology.  The facility is modular, so that additional storage
capacity can be added as needed.  The facility began receiving spent
nuclear fuel in 1999.  PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is
sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site
spent fuel storage facility at Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged
through approximately 2017, under current operating conditions.  If
necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming
appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent
fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of
the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of
the plant.

In 2002,
the President approved the Congressional override of a veto by the State of
Nevada, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the site for development of a
permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste.  In June 2008,
the DOE submitted a license application to the NRC, which the NRC docketed in
September 2008.  The NRC staff review of the application is in
progress.  Petitions for an NRC hearing on the application were filed
in December 2008.

In 1996,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the
NWPA imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent
nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998.  In 1997, the Court ruled
that the contracts between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially
adequate remedy if the DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by
January 31, 1998.  The DOE did not, in fact, begin to accept spent
nuclear fuel by that date.  The DOE continues to contest claims that
its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages.  In January
2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for
unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach of its contract to
accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  PPL cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings.

PROVIDER
OF LAST RESORT SUPPLY

The
Customer Choice Act requires electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric,
to act as a PLR of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will
be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure
default electricity supply in 2010 -- after its current supply agreements with
PPL EnergyPlus expire -- for retail customers who do not choose an alternative
competitive supplier.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric has
completed four of six competitive supply solicitations and has contracted for
two-thirds of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential,
small commercial and small industrial customers.  See "Regulatory
Issues - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information regarding PPL Electric's efforts to provide default
electricity supply for periods after 2010.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

Certain
PPL subsidiaries, including PPL Electric and PPL Generation subsidiaries, are
subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local
laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other
environmental matters.  See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial
Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information
concerning environmental expenditures during 2008 and estimated expenditures
during 2009-2013.  Certain environmental laws, regulations and
developments that may have a substantial impact on PPL are discussed
below.  See "Environmental Matters" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for information regarding these laws and regulations and the status
of PPL's and its subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as
legal and regulatory proceedings involving PPL and its
subsidiaries.

Air

The Clean
Air Act includes, among other things, provisions that:  (a) restrict
the construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and
substantially modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b)
authorize the EPA to impose substantial per day noncompliance penalties for each
facility found to be in violation of the requirements of an applicable state
implementation plan.  State agencies administer the EPA's air quality
regulations through state implementation plans and have concurrent authority to
impose penalties for noncompliance.

In 2005,
the EPA finalized its CAIR requiring substantial reductions for sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides emissions in 28 midwestern and eastern states, including
Pennsylvania.  In July 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit (the U.S. Circuit Court) invalidated CAIR.  In
December 2008, the U.S. Circuit Court remanded CAIR back to the EPA without
vacating the rule.  As a result, CAIR was reinstated and there is once
again a reduction requirement.  Pursuant to a separate rule finalized
in 2005, the EPA also required mercury reductions
nationwide.  However, a federal appeals court has negated the EPA
mercury rule.  The EPA is now developing a mercury MACT
standard.  Based on the federal appeals court action and restrictions
on DEP's authority under Pennsylvania law, PPL challenged Pennsylvania's mercury
regulations.  In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court
(Commonwealth Court) issued its ruling concluding that the Pennsylvania mercury
rule was unlawful, invalid and unenforceable.  The Pennsylvania DEP
has appealed this decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the
Commonwealth Court decision has been automatically stayed.  PPL has
filed an application to lift the stay.  PPL is evaluating its mercury
control plans and what steps it needs to take at this time.

Global Climate
Change

There is
concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the
contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly, carbon
dioxide.  This concern has led to increased federal legislative
proposals, actions at regional, state or local levels, as well as litigation
relating to greenhouse gas emissions, including an April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court
decision holding that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act.

In
addition, the Obama administration has reaffirmed its support for mandatory
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including a cap-and-trade
system.  President Obama's appointee for Administrator of the EPA has
indicated that the EPA is moving forward with regulation of greenhouse gas
emissions under the CAIR, though the exact form of such regulation remains
unclear.

The EPA has also agreed, following this decision, to a
remand of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) applicable to stationary
sources to reconsider its approach to including greenhouse gases under such
rules.  If the EPA concludes greenhouse gases from motor vehicles pose
an endangerment to public health or welfare, this could lead to regulation of
stationary source carbon dioxide emissions.  The EPA might also
proceed to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources directly under the
NSPS or under the provisions of the Clean Air Act requiring Best Available
Control Technology to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas
currently in attainment of ambient air quality standards.  Also,
increased pressure for carbon dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by
investor and environmental organizations and the international
community.  In addition, a nuisance claim brought by a number of
states against other large electric generating companies was dismissed by a
federal district court in New York, but remains pending on appeal in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

PPL
believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material
impact on its capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not now
determinable.  PPL also cannot predict the impact that any pending or
future federal or state legislation regarding more stringent environmental
standards could have on PPL or its subsidiaries.

Water

To
implement the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,
as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987, the
EPA has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric
stations.  The states administer the EPA's effluent standards through
state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges
and water quality.  The standards adopted by the EPA pursuant to the
Clean Water Act may have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain
PPL subsidiaries, depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments
to regulations.  The EPA released its 2008 Effluent Guidelines Plan
and has chosen not to revise the steam electric effluent
guidelines.  Instead, the EPA plans to continue to study the
industry's wastewater discharges, with a focus on coal-fired plants and
"particular interest" in Flue Gas Desulfurization wastewater treatment, ash
sluice water management and water reuse opportunities.  The EPA plans
to continue to study the industry through 2009 and 2010 annual reviews,
including sampling at selected plants.

The EPA
finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake
structures.  These requirements affect where generating facilities are
built, establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for
cooling towers at new and modified power plants.  Another rule
finalized in 2004 that addressed existing structures has been withdrawn
following a January 2007 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.  In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions
for writs of certiorari filed by Utility Water Act Group, Public Service
Enterprise Group, Inc. and Entergy Corporation, limited to one
issue.  The issue is whether Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act
authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the "best
technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact" at cooling
water intake structures.  The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in
December 2008.  Depending on the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court
review and what changes the EPA makes to the rule in accordance with this
decision and the other issues raised by the Second Circuit Court (that will not
be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court), in addition to what actions the states
may take on their own, these actions could result in stricter standards for
existing structures that could impose significant costs on PPL
subsidiaries.

Pursuant
to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977, the OSM has adopted effluent
guidelines which are applicable to PPL subsidiaries as a result of their past
coal mining and processing activities.  The EPA and the OSM
limitations, guidelines and standards also are enforced through the issuance of
NPDES permits.  In accordance with the provisions of the Clean Water
Act and the Reclamation Act of 1977, the EPA and the OSM have authorized the
states to implement the NPDES program.  Compliance with applicable
water quality standards is assured by state imposition of NPDES permit
conditions and requirements to address acid mine drainage.

Solid and Hazardous
Waste

The
provisions of Superfund authorize the EPA to require past and present owners of
contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site to
clean-up the site or pay the EPA or the state for the costs of
cleanup.  The generators and past owners can be liable even if the
generator contributed only a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the
site.  Present owners can be liable even if they contributed no
hazardous substances to the site.

State
laws such as the Pennsylvania and Montana Superfund statutes and the
Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act also give state agencies broad authority
to identify contaminated sites or sites with waste that has been improperly
disposed of, and to order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the
sites.  If responsible parties cannot or will not perform the
clean-up, the agency can hire contractors to clean-up the sites and then require
reimbursement from the responsible parties after the clean-up is
completed.  Another Pennsylvania statute, the Land Recycling and
Environmental Remediation Standards, encourages voluntary clean-ups by allowing
responsible parties to choose from a menu of clean-up standards and providing
liability protection commensurate with the clean-up standard
chosen.

Furthermore,
the EPA and several states, including Montana, are considering establishing
regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act that could impact
the disposal and management of coal combustion products (CCPs), which include
ash and scrubber wastes and other by-products.  The large ash
release

at a
Tennessee Valley Authority site

in Tennessee in December 2008 and
subsequent widespread media coverage has significantly increased the likelihood
of new federal regulatory requirements for CCPs.  PPL cannot predict
at this time what impact, if any, such regulations would have on its operating
facilities.

Certain
federal and state statutes, including federal and state Superfund statutes, also
impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged
natural resources.

Low-Level Radioactive
Waste

Under
federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive
waste generated in that state.  States may join in regional compacts
to jointly fulfill their responsibilities.  The states of
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia are members of the
Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.  Efforts to
develop a regional disposal facility in Pennsylvania were suspended by the
Pennsylvania DEP in 1998.  The Commonwealth retains the legal
authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it be
necessary.  In 2008, low-level radioactive waste from the Susquehanna
facility was sent to independently operated facilities in Barnwell, South
Carolina, and Clive, Utah for disposal.  The Barnwell facility stopped
receiving waste from most states, including Pennsylvania, in June
2008.  PPL will send most of its low-level radioactive waste to the
Clive, Utah facility and the remainder will be stored at the Susquehanna storage
facility.  In the event the Clive site closes or other emergent
disposal options become unavailable or are no longer cost-effective, low-level
radioactive waste will be stored on-site at Susquehanna, in a facility licensed
for that purpose by the NRC.  PPL Susquehanna cannot predict the
future availability of independently operated low-level waste disposal
facilities or the cost of disposal at such facilities.  PPL believes
that its licensed storage facility located at Susquehanna is sufficient for the
foreseeable future to replace the portion of disposal capability at the Barnwell
facility that will not be shifted to the Clive site.

Electric and Magnetic
Fields

Concerns
have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
substation equipment.  Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K.
have reviewed this issue.  The U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes,
there is no evidence that EMFs cause adverse effects.  The agency
further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with
childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without
supporting laboratory evidence.  The U.K. National Radiological
Protection Board (part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded in 2004
that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that EMFs
cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
existing exposure guidelines.  In April 2007, the Stakeholder Group on
Extremely Low Frequency EMF, set up by the U.K. Government, issued its interim
assessment, which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to
EMFs.  This assessment is being considered by the U.K.
Government. PPL and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to
determine whether EMFs cause adverse health effects should continue and are
taking steps to reduce EMFs, where practical, in the design of new transmission
and distribution facilities.  PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to
predict what effect, if any, the EMF issue might have on their operations and
facilities either in the U.S. or the U.K., and the associated cost, or what, if
any, liabilities they might incur related to the EMF issue.

General

PPL and
its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving
environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities
and operations.  In complying with statutes, regulations and actions
by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of
water and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic
substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease
operating certain of their facilities.  PPL's subsidiaries may also
incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which
are not now determinable, but could be significant.

FRANCHISES
AND LICENSES

PPL
Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its
service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded and
as a result of certification by the PUC.  PPL Electric is granted the
right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain
conditions.  In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance,
resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local
political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

See
"Background - Supply Segment" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus's licenses in
various states.  PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the
DOE to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.

PPL
Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating
licenses.  In September 2006, PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for
20-year license renewals for each of the Susquehanna units to extend their
expiration dates, from 2022 to 2042 for Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit
2.  PPL cannot predict whether or when NRC approval will be
obtained.

See Note
9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

In
January 2008, PPL Susquehanna received NRC approval for its request to increase
the generation capacity of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The total
expected capacity increase is 159 MW, of which PPL Susquehanna's share
would be 143 MW.  The first uprate for Unit 1, totaling
50 MW, was completed in May 2008.  The remaining total expected
capacity increase is 109 MW, of which PPL Susquehanna's share would be
98 MW.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the expected capital cost for
this project is $345 million and PPL expects to achieve the full capacity
increase of 159 MW after the refueling outage in 2010 for
Unit 1.

In
October 2008, PPL Susquehanna submitted a COLA to the NRC for a new nuclear
generating unit (Bell Bend) to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna
plant.  The COLA was accepted for review by the NRC in December
2008.  See Note 9 to Financial Statements for additional
information.

PPL
Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a
license renewed by the FERC in 1980 and expiring in 2014.  PPL
Holtwood operates the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to
a license renewed by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044.  PPL
Holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power
Corporation (Safe Harbor), which holds a project license that extends the
operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030.  The
total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating station is 425 MW, and PPL Holtwood
is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity.

In
December 2007, PPL asked the FERC for approval to expand its Holtwood plant by
125 MW.  In December 2008, PPL announced that it had withdrawn the
application in light of current economic conditions, including the high cost of
capital, and projections of future energy prices.  See Note 9 to the
Financial Statements for additional information.

The 11
hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from Montana Power
in 1999 are licensed by the FERC.  These licenses expire periodically,
and the generating facilities must be relicensed at such times.  The
current FERC license for the Mystic facility expires in 2009 but has been
extended, effective January 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year
term.  The Thompson Falls and Kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035,
respectively; and the licenses for the nine Missouri-Madison facilities expire
in 2040.

In
connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, the FERC may,
under applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee,
or the U.S. government may take over the facility.  If the original
licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the
facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable
damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing.

WPD is
authorized by the U.K. government to provide electric distribution services
within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain
conditions and obligations.  For instance, WPD is subject to
governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service
it must provide, and WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does
not meet the mandated standard of service.

WPD
operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by
Ofgem.  The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue
is normally determined every five years with the next review to be completed by
the end of 2009, effective April 1, 2010.  Earnings in 2010 and beyond
may be affected by this rate review.  WPD cannot predict the ultimate
outcome of the rate review.

Approximately
5,000, or 60%, of PPL's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with
four IBEW locals representing approximately 3,600 employees.  The
other unions primarily represent employees of the mechanical
contractors.  The bargaining agreement with the largest IBEW local was
negotiated in May 2006 and expires in 2010.  This agreement covers
approximately 3,250 employees.  The IBEW representing approximately
250 employees at the Montana Colstrip power plants are covered under a four-year
labor agreement expiring in April 2012.  In January 2008, a
four-year contract was renegotiated with the IBEW local of Montana that
represents approximately 80 employees at the hydroelectric facilities and at the
Corette plant that expires in April 2012.

Approximately
1,870, or 82%, of PPL's U.K. workforce are members of labor
unions.  WPD recognizes five unions, the largest of which represents
37% of its union workforce.  WPD's Electricity Business Agreement
covers approximately 1,820 employees; it may be amended by agreement between WPD
and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either
side.

See Note
26 to the Financial Statements for a cost reduction initiative announced in
February 2009, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 200 management
and staff positions at PPL.

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with our
businesses.  While we have identified below the risks we currently
consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we
face.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently
deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  Our
businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  In addition,
this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our
businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  See
"Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the risks
described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact
our businesses and financial results.

As used
in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and its
consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its
consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International
Delivery segment discussions, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries
taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Delivery segment
discussion.

Risks
Related to Supply Segment

(

PPL and PPL Energy
Supply

)

We
are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and
marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets.

We
purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs
authorized by the FERC throughout the U.S. and also enter into short-term
agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation
assets with the expectation of profiting from market price
fluctuations.  If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and
electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay
damages.  These damages would generally be based on the difference
between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the
contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity.  Depending
on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be
significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation
facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and
other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause
significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and
electricity.

In
addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post
collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy
varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds.  At
December 31, 2008, we posted $303 million of collateral, in the form of
letters of credit, under these contracts.  Since 2006, we have
increased our available liquidity facilities to $4.2 billion, to provide for
these collateral obligations and to maintain our credit
ratings.  These increases were needed, in significant part, to meet
potential collateral requirements under these contracts and to support contracts
that we expect to enter into as we seek to grow our wholesale energy
business.  Although we currently believe that we have sufficient
liquidity facilities to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these
contracts, we expect to continue to need to increase our credit facilities to
support our hedging program and collateral requirements and for other purposes,
and there is no certainty that such additional credit will be available when
needed due to the continued financial downturn or other
factors.

We also
face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their
performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a
lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at
the time of contract.  Whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these
risks by various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to
post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the
contract price beyond certain thresholds.  However, there can be no
assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance, which could adversely
impact our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which could
in turn subject us to claims for damages.

Adverse
changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy
margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Our
energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power
exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for
electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, renewable energy
credits, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other
costs.  Unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric
power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production.  As
a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially
over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.  Among
the factors that can influence such prices are:

See
Exhibit 99(a) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in
wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five
years.  The volatility of these business factors has increased
significantly with the current economic downturn.

Our
risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices,
interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned,
and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs.

We
actively manage the market risk inherent in our energy-related, debt, foreign
currency and counterparty credit positions.  We have implemented
procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs,
including validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and
transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of
various risk management metrics.  Nonetheless, our risk management
programs may not work as planned.  For instance, actual electricity
and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the
historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management
positions.  Similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange
rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were
not designed to address.  The volatility of these business factors has
increased significantly with the current economic downturn.  As a
result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions
may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk
models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial
position.

In
addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed to
counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk.  We have adopted a
credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit
risk.  However, if counterparties fail to perform, which is more
likely given the continued economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into
alternative arrangements at then-current market prices.  In that
event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected.  Our
market liquidity risk is discussed further below.

We
do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price
volatility.

We
attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity
sales arrangements by either reserving generation capacity to deliver
electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and
services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales
contracts.  We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and
electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to weather
conditions, fuel requirements and other electricity-related
commodities.  However, based on economic and other considerations, we
may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price
volatility.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price
volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely
affected.  The risks associated with our unhedged positions have
increased significantly with the current economic and financial market
downturn.

We
face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
affect our ability to operate profitably.

Unlike
our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured of
any rate of return on our capital investments through a predetermined rate
structure, and our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our
ability to operate in a competitive environment.  An important focus
of our supply business over the next several years will be the prudent execution
of our marketing strategy based on then prevailing market conditions, but we may
not be successful because of the intense competition that we face in the
deregulated electricity markets.  Competition is impacted by
electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of
generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of
regulatory authorities and other factors.  These competitive factors
may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and
services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and
services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability
to grow our business.

Following
the expiration of our existing power sales agreements, we currently expect to
sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets
through contracts of various durations.  Competition in the wholesale
power markets will occur principally on the basis of the price of products and,
to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability.  We
expect that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities
in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity will
continue to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market in
those regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the prices we
receive for electricity.

We also
face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary
services.  We primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based
on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different
sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and
transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  We also compete
against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and
access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial
resources than we have.

Competitors
in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL
EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies,
non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated
utilities.  In the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and
acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility
sector.  Entirely new competitors, including financial institutions,
have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of
PUHCA.  The repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our
industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial
resources than we have.

Disruptions
in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability to
operate our generation facilities.

We
purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Disruption in the delivery
of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity
(including lime, limestone, other chemicals), including disruptions as a result
of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics,
labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our
fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities,
which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely
affect our results of operations.

Despite
federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject
to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or
prevent or delay operation of our facilities.

Our U.S.
generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale
market.  Generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC.  The FERC has
authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our
marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.  The FERC retains the
authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose
"cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not workably
competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and
reasonable rates.  Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may
receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could
materially adversely affect our results of operations.  See "FERC
Market-Based Rate Authority" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's
market-based rate authority program, and "PJM RPM Litigation" in Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for information regarding FERC proceedings that could
impact PJM's capacity pricing model.

In
addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity
generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and
certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  We
may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory
approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory
approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to
comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and
our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to
additional costs.

Our
generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our
expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our
financial performance.

Our
ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is
critical to our financial performance.  Operation of our power plants
at expected capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or
failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel
interruption.  In addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt
our generation plants.  Weather conditions also have a direct impact
on the river flows required to operate our hydroelectric plants at expected
capacity levels.  Depending on the timing and duration of both planned
and unplanned complete or partial outages at our power plants (in particular, if
such outages are during peak periods or during periods of, or caused by, severe
weather), our revenues from energy sales could significantly decrease and our
expenses significantly increase, and we could be required to purchase power at
then-current market prices to satisfy our energy sales commitments or, in the
alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy
them.  Many of our generating units are reaching mid-life, and we are
faced with the potential for more frequent unplanned outages and the possibility
of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in
major component replacements at these facilities.

We
will selectively continue to pursue growth of generation capacity, which
involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial
results.

Although
our generation expansion program has been substantially scaled back due to the
current economic conditions, on a selective basis, we will continue to pursue
expansion of our generation capacity over the next several years through power
uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of
new power plants and the potential acquisition of existing
plants.  Because of the current adverse conditions in the U.S. economy
and financial markets, any undertaking to expand our generating capability will
be rigorously scrutinized on an ongoing basis and will be subject to
change.  Nevertheless, the acquisition, development and construction
of additional generation capacity involves numerous risks.  Any
planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency
and higher operating and other costs.  With respect to the
construction of new plants or the acquisition of existing plants, we may be
required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting,
resource exploration, legal and other expenses in preparation for competitive
bids that we may not win or before it can be established whether a project is
feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.  The
success of both a new project and a newly-acquired plant would likely be
contingent upon, among other things, the negotiation of satisfactory fuel supply
and power sales contracts, as well as acceptable financing
conditions.  Our success in developing a new plant or expanding
existing generation capacity would likely be contingent upon, among other
things, negotiating satisfactory engineering and construction contracts, receipt
of required and appropriate governmental approvals and satisfactory completion
of construction.  If we were unable to complete construction or
expansion of a facility, we would generally be unable to recover our investment
in the project.  Furthermore, we might be unable to run any new or
acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than
projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings.

For
example, as discussed in more detail in Note 9 to the Financial Statements, in
October 2008, we filed a COLA with the NRC to construct a new nuclear unit which
is technology specific.  We have made substantial COLA expenditures,
but we have not yet committed to construction of this new nuclear unit as such
construction is subject to numerous uncertainties.  In addition to the
general uncertainties discussed above for our generation expansion plans, these
uncertainties include NRC and other governmental approvals, potential public
opposition, continuing NRC review of the Evolutionary Power Reactor technology
involved, the cost and availability of acceptable financing, including under the
DOE's loan guarantee and other governmental programs, acceptable arrangements
with project partners and vendors, rating agency concerns, schedule delays,
legislative and regulatory changes, competitive market structure and the
prospect for cost recovery, among other factors.

Changes
in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants.

A basic
premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants
achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low
price.  There are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most
notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar)
cells.  Research and development activities are ongoing to seek
improvements in alternate technologies.  It is possible that advances
will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level
that is equal to or below that of most central station
production.  Also, as new technologies are developed and become
available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by
customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by
generators.  In addition, the new presidential administration and the
new U.S. Congress have voiced strong support for such alternative energy
sources.  As a result of these factors, the value of our generation
facilities could be significantly reduced.

On
February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the $787 billion American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 Stimulus Act") to provide
incentives and financial support to the U.S. economy.  Among other
things, the 2009 Stimulus Act specifically provides a total of $58 billion to be
available for energy-related initiatives, primarily $20 billion in renewable
energy tax credits to encourage development of wind, solar and other renewable
energy sources, and $32 billion for development of a "smart grid" in the U.S.
(the term smart grid, generally, means computer-based and other enhancements to
the electricity distribution and transmission system that will both (i) make
consumption of electricity more efficient, thereby requiring lower generation
and achieving corresponding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and (ii)
better enable alternative sources of generated electricity, like that from solar
and wind sources, to be introduced into the national and regional electricity
grids in the U.S).  It is uncertain at this time to what extent these
initiatives may impact our businesses, except that little impact is expected in
the short term.  The 2009 Stimulus Act does not address issues related
to nuclear generation or what action, if any, may be taken to increase the $18.5
billion in federal loans or guarantees to support construction of new nuclear
facilities that was contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  In
addition, it does not appear that the 2009 Stimulus Act is intended to provide
incentives for the development of "clean coal" technology.  Obama
administration designees have stated that the administration favors
"cap-and-trade" programs to control carbon emissions, but it is uncertain at the
present time what effects such programs are likely to have on our
businesses.

Marketing
energy for the period after expiration of the PLR contracts poses other risks to
the Supply segment.

The
existing full requirements PLR contracts between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric
expire at the end of 2009.  In connection with PPL Electric's
PUC-approved procurement plan for default electricity supply in 2010 for retail
customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier, PPL EnergyPlus
was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive solicitation process
and in July 2007, entered into an agreement with PPL Electric to supply up to
671 MW of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42 per
MWh.  At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which PPL
EnergyPlus will sell additional power to PPL Electric after 2009.  In
anticipation of the expiration of the PLR contracts at the end of 2009, our
energy marketing and trading operation continues to enter into other new supply
contracts for the post-2009 period, including bilateral and load-following
contracts with new counterparties at market prices.  The electricity
supply obligations under these new contracts will be met by generation we own
and electricity and other energy-related products purchased from other
parties.  In connection with these activities, we hedge the future
energy production capability of our generation facilities and the related fuel
costs by buying and selling energy, capacity, fuel, transmission and other
products in the wholesale energy markets and entering into various forms of
financial and physical contracts to capture additional energy margins and
generally manage risk.  These activities may cause volatility in
future cash flows and results of operations.

Whether
we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power
sale, fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements to mitigate market price
and supply risk may affect our earnings.

As a
result of the PLR contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion
of our anticipated generation production and capacity value is currently
committed through 2009 under power sales agreements of various terms that
include fixed prices for electric power.  In addition, we are actively
pursuing other load-following or full requirements contracts with other parties
in energy market auctions and elsewhere.  In connection with such
agreements, we have entered into longer-term fuel purchase and fuel
transportation agreements that include fixed prices for a significant portion of
our forecasted needs.  Whether we decide to, or are able to continue
to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements, the market
conditions at that time, will affect our financial performance.  For
instance, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would sell the
energy, capacity and other products from our facilities in the competitive
wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current
market prices.

Although the current
forward prices for electricity are less than the prices available under some of
our existing power sales agreements, this situation may not
continue.  In addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel
purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our power generation facilities,
our fuel costs (and associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed the
revenues we derive from our energy sales.  Given the volatility and
potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and fuel
and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity sales and
fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be subject to
increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel costs (and
associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may be materially
adversely affected.

The
PLR contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply and demand and
actual activity significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely
affect our energy margins.

PPL
Electric is obligated to provide electricity supply to its PLR customers at
predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into PUC-approved, full
requirements energy supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at the rates PPL
Electric is entitled to charge its PLR customers to fulfill its PLR
obligation.  If PPL Electric's customers obtain electricity from
alternate suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, PPL EnergyPlus's
sales of electricity under the PLR contracts could decrease.

Alternatively,
demand that we satisfy pursuant to the PLR contracts could increase as a result
of severe weather conditions, economic developments or other reasons over which
we have no control.  We satisfy our electricity supply obligations
through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation
assets, contractual relationships and market purchases.  At December
31, 2008, the PLR requirements required about 86% of the normal operating
capacity of our existing Pennsylvania generation assets.  A
significant increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins because
we are required under the terms of the PLR contracts to provide the energy
necessary to fulfill increased demand at the capped rates, which we expect to
remain below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase additional
supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at which we could
otherwise sell the additional supply.  Accordingly, any significant
increase in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial position.

We have
other load-following or full requirements contracts with other counterparties
and are actively pursuing other similar contracts.  These contracts
present the same general risks surrounding variability of demand as those noted
above under the existing PLR contracts, which has been partially mitigated
through our hedging activities.

If
market deregulation is reversed, discontinued or delayed, our business prospects
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Some
deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price
volatility.  In some of these markets, state legislators, government
agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to delay market
restructuring, change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of
these markets that have previously been deregulated or permit electricity
delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities.  In
certain states, elements and implications of the electricity market
restructurings are being investigated by legislators and regulators or are the
subject of ongoing litigation.  In addition, the ISOs that oversee the
transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to
time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address
volatility in the power markets.  These types of price limitations and
other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and
trading business would have realized based on competitive market conditions
absent such limitations and mechanisms.  Although we generally expect
electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to
re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting
the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed,
discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future,
operate.

At this
time, there are various ongoing regulatory and legislative activities in
Pennsylvania regarding PLR supply after 2009.  We cannot predict the
final outcome of these regulatory and legislative activities or their ultimate
impact on PPL and PPL Energy Supply, or PPL Electric.  For additional
information on PLR issues after 2009, see

"Conditions affecting PPL Electric's
PLR supply after 2009 are currently uncertain"

under the "Risks Related
to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment" discussion.

We
rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to
deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas.  If transmission is
disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our
ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered.

We depend
on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and
other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to the
wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric
generation facilities.  If transmission is disrupted (as a result of
weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by
ISOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell
and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or
we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms.

The FERC
has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to
be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis.  Although
these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access
to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission
capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we
desire.  We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result
of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific
markets or whether ISOs in applicable markets will operate the transmission
networks, and provide related services, efficiently.

Our
costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to
continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital
expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely
affect our profitability and liquidity.

Our
business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and
regulations relating to environmental protection.  To comply with
existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary
pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend
substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and
compliance.

In order
to comply with existing and recently-enacted federal environmental laws and
regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005
PPL began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment
(primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate and nitrogen oxides with
co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction).  The estimated cost to
install this equipment is approximately $1.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion has
already been spent.  The remaining unspent balance is included in the
2009 through 2013 capital budget.  The scrubbers at our Montour plant
are now in service.  We are continuing with installation of scrubbers
at our Brunner Island plant.  Delays in such installation could
require us to purchase additional pollution control emission allowances at
market prices or decrease the expected value of excess emission allowances that
we could sell at market prices as a result of the scheduled installation of this
equipment.  Such a delay also could require us to burn higher-cost,
lower-sulfur coal at these facilities.  In addition, many states and
environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations
relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict.  As a
result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that
will impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which
could require us to increase capital expenditures for pollution control
equipment significantly.

We may
not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals
necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary to
our business.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required
environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply
with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or
subjected to additional costs.  Furthermore, at some of our older
generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary
equipment, which could cause us to shut down those units.

There
also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global
warming).  Various legislative proposals are being considered in
Congress, and several states already have passed legislation capping carbon
dioxide emissions.  The new presidential administration has stated
that it intends to make the control of air emissions, including the global
warming issue, a major initiative.  This, combined with the changes in
the U.S. Congress as a result of the last national election, may make the risks
identified above more likely to occur.

For more
information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed
federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are
subject, see "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements.

We
are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our
Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety
requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and
uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its
licensed life.

Nuclear
generation accounted for about 32% of our 2008 generation output.  The
risks of nuclear generation generally include:

·

the
      potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the
      operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of
      radioactive materials;

·

limitations
      on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
      losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear
      operations; and

·

uncertainties
      with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
      nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
  lives.

The NRC
has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as well
as security-related, safety-related, and employee-related requirements for the
operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of
noncompliance, the NRC has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or
both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved.  In addition, revised security or safety
requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital or
operating expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.  In addition,
although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our
Susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss,
damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Risks
Related to International Delivery Segment

(

PPL and PPL Energy
Supply

)

Our
U.K. delivery business is also subject to risks with respect to rate regulation
and operational performance.

Our U.K.
delivery business

is rate
regulated and

operates under an incentive-based regulatory
framework.  In addition, its ability to manage operational risk is
critical to its financial performance.  Accordingly, with the
exception of those risks relating to energy supply, this business is subject to
the same general risks as those described below under "Risks Related to
Pennsylvania Delivery Segment."

Our
U.K. delivery business exposes us to risks related to U.K. laws, taxes, economic
conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political and
regulatory conditions and policies of the U.K. government.  These
risks may reduce the results of operations from our U.K. delivery
business.

The
acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the U.K. entail
significant financial risks including:

Risks
Related to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment

(

PPL and PPL
Electric

)

Regulators
may not approve the rates we request.

Our
Pennsylvania delivery business is rate-regulated.  While such
regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs,
including energy supply costs for customers, and a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are
subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory
authorities.  Our Pennsylvania delivery business is subject to
substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which
will require rate increase requests to the regulators.  There is no
guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match our actual costs or
provide a particular return on invested capital at any given time.

Our
transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which may
increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect
on our financial performance.

Our
ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and
distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery
business.  Our delivery business also faces several risks, including
the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due
to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes and other
factors.  Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may
result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance
costs.

We
may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of PJM's
regional transmission expansion plan (RTEP) process.

PJM and
the FERC have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional
transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission
owners.  As discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements, we will
make substantial expenditures to construct the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission
line that PJM has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional
transmission grid.  Although the FERC has granted our request for
incentive rate treatment of such facilities we cannot predict the date when
these facilities will be in service or whether delays may occur due to public
opposition and other factors.  Delays could result in significant cost
increases for these facilities and decreased reliability of the regional
transmission grid.  As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate
financial or operational impact of this project or other RTEP projects on PPL
Electric.

We
could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory
reliability standards.

Under the
Energy Policy Act, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system
are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and
enforced by the FERC.  Compliance with new reliability standards may
subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and
violations of these standards could result in substantial
penalties.  As discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, as a
result of its self-reporting to the RFC of a potential violation of certain
reliability standards, PPL Electric could be subject to substantial penalties
for such violation.

PPL
Electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able to
obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge to
its PLR customers.

In order
to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply
through 2009 at the predetermined capped rates we may charge our PLR customers,
we have entered into PUC-approved, full requirements energy supply agreements
with PPL EnergyPlus at these capped rates.  Under one of the PLR
contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits to PPL
EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract price
by more than our contract collateral threshold.  Conversely, PPL
EnergyPlus is required to make performance assurance deposits to us when the
market price of electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its
contract collateral threshold.  Over the past few years, market prices
for electricity have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at
December 31, 2008, the fair value of the PLR contract was approximately $917
million.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, PPL EnergyPlus was
required to provide us performance assurance of $300 million, the maximum amount
required under the contract.  If PPL EnergyPlus is unable to satisfy
its energy supply obligations to us under the PLR contracts, we would be
required to obtain energy supply in the wholesale market at then-current market
rates to meet our PLR obligation.  While the Customer Choice Act
provides generally for PLR costs to be borne by customers, it is not clear
whether we would be able to pass on to our customers any costs of this
replacement energy supply that exceed the predetermined capped
rates.

Conditions
affecting PPL Electric's PLR supply after 2009 are currently
uncertain.

Uncertainty
driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009 when its full requirements contracts with PPL EnergyPlus
expire presents a risk for the electricity delivery business.  The
Customer Choice Act requires electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric,
to act as a PLR of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will
be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC. In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure default
electricity supply in 2007 through 2009 for retail customers who do not choose
an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this plan,
PPL Electric has contracted for two-thirds of the 2010 default electricity
supply it expects to need for residential and small commercial and industrial
customers.  The PUC has approved a plan filed by PPL Electric under
which the Company's residential and small commercial and industrial customers,
beginning in 2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price
increases when generation rate caps expire in 2010.

In
February 2009, PPL Electric asked the PUC for permission to offer customers a
second option for reducing the potential initial impact of higher electricity
prices resulting from expiration of the generation rate caps.  If
approved by the PUC, this option would enable eligible residential and eligible
small-business customers to defer payment of any increase greater than 25% in
their 2010 electric bills.  The 25% will be calculated on an average
rate schedule usage basis, and will be based on a comparison of currently
estimated 2009 bills to currently estimated 2010 bills.

In
addition, i

n September 2007, PUC regulations became effective requiring
Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond.  In 2008, PPL Electric filed for PUC approval of its 2011
through May 2014 supply procurement plan under these regulations.  PPL
Electric subsequently amended the termination date of the plan to 2013,
consistent with provisions of Act 129, discussed below.

In
addition to this regulatory activity, in June 2008, the Pennsylvania General
Assembly (General Assembly) passed, and the Governor signed, a bill that would
create a $650 million fund for clean energy projects, conservation and energy
efficiency initiatives and pollution control projects to be funded through
revenue bonds and gross receipts tax revenue, which will increase as rate caps
expire.  In October 2008 the General Assembly passed and the Governor
signed into law Act 129.  The law creates an energy efficiency and
conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new PLR
electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct,
and makes changes to the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio
Standard.  The law also requires electric utilities to meet specified
goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified
dates.  Utilities not meeting the requirements of Act 129 are subject
to significant penalties.  Although we expect to meet these
requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance
with these requirements and result in penalties on us.

The
Pennsylvania Governor recently publicly stated that he expects some form of rate
mitigation to be passed by the state legislature.  We have continued
to work with elected officials and regulators on constructive ways to achieve
rate mitigation.  However, in the last legislative session, certain
Pennsylvania legislators introduced legislation to extend generation rate caps
or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for Pennsylvania utilities beyond
the end of their transition periods, which in PPL Electric's case is December
31, 2009.  PPL and PPL Electric have expressed strong concern
regarding the severe potential consequences of such rate caps or legislation on
customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation supply and PPL
Electric's financial viability.  It is possible that similar
legislation could be reintroduced.  If such legislation were
introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could face severe financial
consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow
shortfalls.  In addition, continuing uncertainty regarding PPL
Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its
business after 2009 could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs
and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its
business.

Whether
we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into power purchase contracts to
mitigate market price and delivery risk, and our ability to recover costs
associated with such contracts, may affect our earnings.

In order
to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply
after 2009 when our full requirements energy supply agreements with PPL
EnergyPlus expire, we have entered into power purchase agreements that include
fixed prices.  Whether we decide or are able to continue to enter into
such agreements, and the market conditions at that time, will affect our
financial performance.  For instance, in the absence of power purchase
agreements, we would purchase energy, capacity and other products in the
competitive wholesale power markets at then-current market
prices.  The current forward prices for electricity exceed the prices
available under some of our current power sales agreements, and our financial
performance will be affected by our ability to enter into new supply contracts,
the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to prevailing market
conditions, and the regulatory treatment for such contracts and the associated
recovery of our supply costs.  Depending on these factors, our
financial results may be materially adversely affected.

Other
Risks Related to All Segments

(

PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric

)

The
current economic and financial market downturn could continue to adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
business has been impacted by the current recession in the U.S. and related
market factors, along with the economic downturn world-wide.  The
breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions have had a wide-ranging
impact on the U.S. and international business environment, including our
business, and the adverse effects on our financial condition and results of
operations may continue.  As a result of the economic downturn,
economic activity has declined significantly, along with demand for electric
power.  This reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic
wholesale energy markets we serve (such as PJM) and our Pennsylvania and U.K.
delivery businesses, especially industrial customer demand.  The
combination of lower demand for power and decreased natural gas prices has put
downward price pressure on the wholesale energy market in general, further
impacting our energy marketing results.  In general, market volatility
in energy and fuel prices is expected to continue, decreasing the predictability
regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and general financial
condition.

Our
businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital for, among other things,
funding our need for collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing
business.  Global bank credit capacity has been reduced dramatically
and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities has increased
significantly.  New bank credit facilities generally are being
restricted to less than one-year terms, thereby introducing uncertainties as to
businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably
estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit.

In
addition, although we have reduced our planned capital expenditures, we still
have substantial financing requirements over the next several
years.  We expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital
for these purposes; however, our financing costs are expected to increase and
the continued financial market downturn could adversely affect our financial
condition and liquidity.

The
current economic and financial market downturn is expected to continue to
adversely impact numerous other factors in our business operations discussed
elsewhere in this Risk Factor section.

Our
operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of
severe weather conditions.

Our
businesses are seasonal.  For example, in some markets demand for, and
market prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other
markets such peaks occur in the cold winter months.  As a result, our
overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a
seasonal basis, especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves,
extreme cold weather or storms make such fluctuations more
pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on
the nature and location of the facilities we acquire or develop and the terms of
our contracts to sell electricity.

We
cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently
being conducted with respect to our current and past business
activities.  An adverse determination could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

We are
involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing
state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the
most significant of which are summarized in "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues"
and in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters,
nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially
result from a negative outcome in each case.

We
may need significant additional financing to pursue growth
opportunities.

We
continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may enter
into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the
future.  An acquisition agreement or development commitment may
require access to substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable
terms.  We also may need external financing to fund capital
expenditures, including capital expenditures necessary to comply with
environmental regulations or other regulatory requirements.  Our
ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are dependent on numerous
factors, including general economic conditions, credit availability and our
financial performance.  Arranging such financing is difficult as a
result of the current financial market downturn.  The inability to
obtain sufficient financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely
affect our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund
capital expenditures.

A
downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access
capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new
debt.

Our
current credit ratings by Moody's, Fitch and S&P, including a January 2009
review by S&P that resulted in a negative outlook for us, are listed in
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital
Resources."  While we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability
to fund short-term liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any
ratings downgrades could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively
affect our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new
long-term debt.

Significant
increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and
pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and
liquidity.

We
continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and
maintenance expenses.  However, we expect to continue to face
increased cost pressures in our operations. The cost of materials and labor
result from general inflation, increased nationwide plant construction and other
factors.  In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements,
we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and
pension benefits to current employees and retirees covered by the
contracts.  We provide a similar level of benefits to our management
employees.  These benefits give rise to significant
expenses.  Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the
aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced
significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health
care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase
despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and
retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care
benefits.  In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant
costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and
retirees.  The measurement of our expected future health care and
pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of
assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our
control.  These assumptions include investment returns, interest
rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the
demographics of plan participants.  For example, our projected pension
costs have increased significantly as a result of the decreased investment
returns and interest rates due to the economic downturn in the U.S. and
world-wide.  If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future
costs could increase significantly.

There
is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for
certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our
earnings.

Under
GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets
may be impaired.  While no goodwill impairments were recorded based on
our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2008, we are unable to predict
whether any impairment charges may be necessary in the future.

We also
review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be
recoverable.  During 2008, PPL recorded an impairment charge related
to a cancelled hydroelectric expansion project and certain emission allowances
and recorded an additional impairment charge related to its natural gas
distribution and propane businesses that were sold in October.  During
2007, PPL impaired certain transmission rights, certain domestic
telecommunications assets, certain assets of the natural gas distribution and
propane businesses, and the net assets of our Bolivian businesses prior to their
sale in July 2007.  During 2006, PPL recorded a loss on the sale of
our interest in the Griffith plant and fully impaired our synfuel-related
assets.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the Financial
Statements.  We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or
other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future
years.

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL is an
energy and utility holding company with headquarters in Allentown,
PA.  Please refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for descriptions
of PPL's reportable segments, which are Supply, International Delivery and
Pennsylvania Delivery.  Through its subsidiaries, PPL is primarily
engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets - the
northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity in
Pennsylvania and the U.K.  PPL's overall strategy is to achieve
disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both
cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in its regulated
electricity delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer
and regulatory relations.  More specifically, PPL's strategy for its
electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with
load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy
counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy
and fuel price volatility, counterparty credit risk and operational
risk.  PPL's strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to
own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining
high quality customer service and reliability.

PPL faces
several risks in its generation business, principally electricity and capacity
wholesale price risk, fuel supply and price risk, power plant performance,
evolving regulatory frameworks and counterparty credit risk.  PPL
attempts to manage these risks through various means.  For instance,
PPL operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to
geography, fuel source, cost structure and operating
characteristics.  PPL expects to expand its generation capacity over
the next several years through power uprates at certain of its existing power
plants, and is continually evaluating the potential construction of new plants
and the potential acquisition of existing plants or businesses.  PPL
is and will continue to remain focused on the operating efficiency and
availability of its existing and any newly constructed or acquired power
plants.  In addition, PPL has executed and continues to pursue
contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel supply, while using other
means to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference,
or margin, between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which PPL
sells it.  PPL's future profitability will be affected by whether PPL
decides to, or is able to, continue to enter into long-term or intermediate-term
power sales and fuel purchase agreements or renew its existing agreements and
prevailing market conditions.  Currently, PPL's commitments for energy
sales are satisfied through its own generation assets and supply purchased from
third parties.  PPL markets and trades around its physical portfolio
of generating assets through integrated generation, marketing and trading
functions.

PPL has
adopted risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to
monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to
changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its
generating units.

The
principal challenge that PPL faces in its electricity delivery businesses is to
maintain high quality customer service and reliability in a cost-effective
manner.  PPL's electricity delivery businesses are
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, these businesses are subject to
regulatory risk with respect to costs that may be recovered and investment
returns that may be collected through customer rates.  In particular,
uncertainty driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL
Electric's PLR obligation after 2009, when its full requirements supply
contracts with PPL EnergyPlus expire, presents a risk for the Pennsylvania
electricity delivery business.  The Customer Choice Act requires
electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric, to act as a PLR of
electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered
by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC.  As discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements, there are a number of ongoing regulatory and legislative activities
that may affect PPL Electric's recovery of supply costs after
2009.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure
default electricity supply in 2007 through 2009 for retail customers who do not
choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this
plan, PPL Electric has contracted for two-thirds of the 2010 electricity supply
it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial
customers.  In August 2008, the PUC approved a plan proposed by PPL
Electric, under which its residential and small commercial customers, beginning
in 2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price increases
when generation rate caps expire in 2010.  Approximately 10% of PPL
Electric's customers are participating in the plan.

In
February 2009, PPL Electric asked the PUC for permission to offer customers a
second option for reducing the potential initial impact of higher electricity
prices resulting from expiration of the generation rate caps.  If
approved by the PUC, this option would enable eligible residential and eligible
small-business customers to defer payment of any increase greater than 25% in
their 2010 electric bills.  The 25% will be calculated on an average
rate schedule usage basis, and will be based on a comparison of currently
estimated 2009 bills to currently estimated 2010 bills.

In September 2007, the PUC regulations became effective
regarding the obligation of Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default
electricity supply in 2011 and beyond.  In August 2008, PPL Electric
filed for PUC approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan under these
regulations.  In addition to this regulatory activity, in October
2008, the legislature passed and the Pennsylvania Governor signed a bill that,
among other things:  (i) requires electric utilities to meet specified
goals for reduction in use and peak demand; (ii) establishes procedures and
standards for the purchase of PLR supply; and (iii) requires utilities to
install smart metering technology and offer time-of-use
rates.  Utilities must file with the PUC by July 1, 2009, for
approval of plans to meet the conservation and demand side requirements of the
legislation.

The
Governor recently publicly stated that he expects some form of rate mitigation
to be passed by the state legislature.

In addition, in the last
legislative session, certain Pennsylvania legislators introduced legislation to
extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in PPL
Electric's case is December 31, 2009.

It is
possible that similar legislation could be reintroduced.  If such
legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could
experience substantial operating losses, cash flow shortfalls and other adverse
financial impacts.

In
addition to the activities discussed above relating to PPL Electric's PLR
obligations, PPL Electric is engaged in three other major regulatory
proceedings.  First, in April 2008, the FERC granted PPL Electric's
request for incentive rate treatment for the Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV
Transmission Line.  Those incentives are:  (i) a 1.25%
increase to the return on equity previously approved for the project, (ii)
inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base, and (iii) recovery of
all costs if the line is abandoned.  In addition, FERC granted PPL
Electric a 0.5% increase to the return on equity previously approved for its
continuing membership in PJM.  Second, in August 2008, PPL Electric
requested permission from FERC to replace its stated rates for transmission
service with a formula rate.  In October 2008, FERC permitted PPL
Electric's proposed formula rate to go into effect, subject to
refund.  The matter is in settlement discussions before an
administrative law judge.  Third, in January 2009, PPL Electric filed
its application with the PUC requesting permission to site and construct the
Susquehanna-Roseland line.  PUC review is expected to take
approximately one year.

PPL faces
additional financial risks in conducting international operations, such as
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  PPL attempts to
manage these financial risks through its risk management programs.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for
PPL's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL
continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and
liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks
PPL faces in its businesses.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL's past and
expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the
risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

In 2007,
PPL sold its regulated electricity delivery businesses in Latin America, which
were included in the International Delivery segment.  In October 2008,
PPL completed the sale of its natural gas distribution and propane businesses,
which were included in the Pennsylvania Delivery segment.  See Note 10
to the Financial Statements for information on the sales.

Market
Events

The
continued downturn in the financial markets has increased the complexity of
managing credit risk, responding to liquidity needs, measuring derivatives and
other financial instruments at fair value, and managing market price
risk.

Global
bank credit capacity has been reduced dramatically and the cost of renewing or
establishing new credit facilities has increased significantly.  New
bank credit facilities generally are being restricted to less than one-year
terms, thereby introducing uncertainties as to businesses' ability to enter into
long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and
availability of credit.

Commodity Price
Risk

The
volatility of wholesale energy prices due to the continued financial downturn
significantly impacted PPL's earnings in 2008.  See "Statement of
Income Analysis - Domestic Gross Energy Margins - Domestic Gross Energy Margins
By Region" for further discussion.

Credit
risk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by
counterparties of their contractual obligations.  PPL maintains credit
policies and procedures to limit counterparty credit risk.  The
continued volatility and downturn in financial and commodity markets during 2008
have generally increased PPL's exposure to credit risk.  See Note 19
to the Financial Statements for additional information about credit
concentration and "Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other -
Credit Risk" for more information on credit risk.

Liquidity
Issues

The
continued downturn in financial markets has generally made obtaining new sources
of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and costly.  During
this challenging period, PPL expects to continue to have access to adequate
sources of liquidity through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and its credit facilities.  In 2009, subject to
market conditions, PPL plans to issue up to $300 million in long-term debt
securities and to remarket to unaffiliated investors $150 million of tax-exempt
bonds that were issued by the PEDFA in December 2008 on behalf of PPL Energy
Supply and for which a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply acted as initial
purchaser.  PPL does not expect to need to issue any commercial paper
during 2009, but may do so from time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow
needs if commercial paper market conditions improve.  See "Financial
Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for an expanded discussion of PPL's
liquidity position and a discussion of financing transactions.

Valuations in Inactive
Markets

The
continued downturn in the financial markets has generally made it difficult to
determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in inactive
markets.  Management has reviewed the activity in the energy and
financial markets in which PPL transacts, concluding that substantially all of
these markets were active as of December 31, 2008, with the exception of the
market for auction rate securities.  See Notes 18 and 23 to the
Financial Statements and "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources
- - Auction Rate Securities" for a discussion of these investments.

Securities Price
Risk

Declines
in the market price of debt and equity securities resulted in unrealized losses
that have reduced the asset values of PPL's investments in its nuclear
decommissioning trust funds and defined benefit plans.  The nuclear
plant decommissioning trust funds experienced negative investment returns during
2008.  The assets in these funds support the costs to decommission the
Susquehanna nuclear plant when its licenses, subject to any extensions, expire
in 2022 and 2024.  The obligation to decommission the nuclear plant is
long-term in nature, exposing the assets held in the funds to price
risk.  PPL actively monitors the performance of the investments held
in the funds and periodically reviews the funds' investment allocations. See
"Financial Condition - Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and
Other - Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk" for
additional information on securities price risk.

PPL's
defined benefit plans experienced negative investment returns in 2008, impacting
the funded status of those plans as disclosed in Note 13 to the Financial
Statements.  Determination of the funded status of defined benefit
plans, contribution requirements and net periodic defined benefit costs for
future years are subject to changes in several assumptions, including the
performance of the assets in the plans.  See "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for a discussion of the assumptions and
sensitivities regarding those assumptions.

Outlook

Excluding
special items and the impact of the cost reduction initiative discussed below,
PPL projects higher earnings for its Supply business segment in 2009 compared
with 2008, driven by higher energy margins, despite higher expected coal
expense, as a result of higher baseload generation; higher Western U.S. energy
sales prices; and higher expected margins from its marketing and trading
activities.  The Supply segment also expects to incur higher operation
and maintenance expenses, depreciation and financing costs in 2009.

See Note
26 to the Financial Statements for additional information on a cost reduction
initiative completed in February 2009.  The Supply segment expects to
achieve annual pre-tax savings of between $14 and $17 million from the reduction
of management and staff positions, including a reduction of costs allocated as a
result of the elimination of positions at PPL
Services.

International Delivery
Segment

The
International Delivery segment consists primarily of the distribution of
electricity in the U.K.  In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Latin
American businesses.  In the first quarter of 2008, the International
Delivery segment recognized income tax adjustments and other expenses in
Discontinued Operations as the dissolution of the remaining Latin American
holding companies commenced.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.

The
International Delivery segment results in 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflect the
reclassification of Latin American revenues and expenses to Discontinued
Operations.

Outlook

Excluding

International Delivery segment as a result of higher income taxes and a less
favorable currency exchange rate in the U.K.

Pennsylvania Delivery
Segment

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric and gas delivery
operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.  In October 2008,
PPL sold its natural gas distribution and propane businesses.  See
Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment results in 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflect the

(a)

In
      2005, the Pennsylvania Delivery segment recorded a loss accrual, including
      interest expense, related to a PJM billing dispute.  In 2006,
      the accrual was reduced and it was determined that the Supply segment was
      responsible for a portion of the loss accrual, including
      interest.

Outlook

Excluding
special items and the impact of the cost reduction discussed below, PPL projects
lower earnings in 2009 compared with 2008, for its Pennsylvania Delivery segment
due to the divestiture of the natural gas distribution and propane businesses
and slightly lower results from the electricity delivery business (where
slightly higher revenues are expected to be offset by higher operation and
maintenance expenses).

See Note
26 to the Financial Statements for additional information on a cost reduction
initiative completed in February 2009.  The Pennsylvania Delivery
segment expects to achieve annual pre-tax savings of between $6 and $8 million
from the reduction of management and staff positions, including a reduction of
costs allocated as a result of the elimination of positions at PPL
Services.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the PUC-approved plan to
procure default electricity supply in 2007 through 2009, additional information
on Pennsylvania legislative and other regulatory activities, and a FERC-approved
transmission rate, all of which may impact future results of
operations.

Statement
of Income Analysis --

Domestic
Gross Energy Margins

Non-GAAP Financial
Measure

The
following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure, "Domestic Gross Energy
Margins."  The presentation of "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" is
intended to supplement the investor's understanding of PPL's domestic
non-trading and trading activities by combining applicable income statement line
items and related adjustments to calculate a single financial
measure.  PPL believes that "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" are useful
and meaningful to investors because they provide them with the results of PPL's
domestic non-trading and trading activities as another criterion in making their
investment decisions.  PPL's management also uses "Domestic Gross
Energy Margins" in measuring certain corporate performance goals used in
determining variable compensation.  Other companies may use different
measures to present the results of their non-trading and trading
activities.  Additionally, "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" are not
intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with
GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  The following
table provides a reconciliation between "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" as
defined by PPL and "Operating Income."

      which is reflected in the Statement of Income in Discontinued
      Operations.

Eastern
U.S.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins were $106 million lower in 2008 compared with
2007.  This decrease was primarily due to higher average fuel prices,
up 16%, primarily due to higher coal prices.  Also contributing to the
decrease was lower baseload generation, down 4%, primarily due to unplanned
outages at the eastern coal-fired units and retirement of the Martins Creek
coal-fired units in September 2007.  Partially offsetting these lower
margins were higher margins from the hedged sale of generation in the wholesale
market and a 1.4% increase in PLR sales prices in accordance with the PUC Final
Order.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins were $109 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to new full requirements supply
contracts and higher wholesale market prices for electricity.  Also
contributing to the improvement was increased generation output from PPL's
nuclear and coal-fired facilities.  Nuclear generation was 2% higher
in 2007.  Coal-fired generation was up slightly in 2007 despite
retirement of Martins Creek Units 1 and 2 in September.

Western
U.S.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins were $8 million higher in 2008 compared with
2007.  This increase was primarily due to increased generation from
the hydroelectric units, up 2%.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins were $27 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to higher market prices for
electricity combined with increased generation from coal-fired generating
facilities.  Coal-fired generation was 6% higher in 2007.

Net
Energy Trading

PPL
enters into energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL may at times create a net open
position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do
not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The margins from
these trading activities are reflected in the Statements of Income as "Net
energy trading margins."  These physical and financial contracts cover
trading activity associated with electricity, FTRs, gas, and oil.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $162 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  This decrease consists of $135 million of lower unrealized
margins and $27 million of lower realized margins, both driven by significant
decreases in power and gas prices.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $6 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  Energy trading margins from realized transactions decreased $10
million and were partially offset by a $4 million increase from unrealized
transactions.

The
realized physical volumes for electricity and gas associated with energy trading

The
increases in utility revenues for 2008 compared with 2007, excluding foreign
currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to:

·

higher
      PLR revenue, attributable to normal load growth, and higher domestic
      delivery revenue, primarily attributable to a base rate increase effective
      January 1, 2008, as well as normal load growth.  These increases
      were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather on residential
      and commercial sales in 2008; and

·

higher
      U.K. electric delivery revenues for 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due
      to an increase in prices effective April 1 and favorable changes in
      customer mix, partially offset by a decrease in engineering and metering
      services performed for third
parties.

The
increases in utility revenues for 2007 compared with 2006, excluding foreign
currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to:

·

higher
      domestic PLR revenues and electric delivery revenues, primarily due to a
      4% increase in sales volume, resulting primarily from the impact of
      favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial sales, and normal
      load growth; and

·

higher
      U.K. electric delivery revenues, primarily due to an increase in prices
      effective April 1, favorable changes in customer mix and an increase in
      engineering services performed for third parties.  The increase
      was partially offset by a 3% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to
      milder weather in 2007.

Energy-related
Businesses

Energy-related
businesses contributed $31 million more to operating income in 2008 compared
with 2007.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Energy-related
businesses contributed $27 million more to operating income in 2007 compared
with 2006.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

·

$61
      million of higher pre-tax contributions from synfuel
      projects.  This reflects a $66 million net gain on the
      settlement of options purchased to hedge the risk associated with the
      phase-out of the synthetic fuel tax credits and an impairment charge of
      $10 million on synfuel-related assets in 2006, partially offset by $15
      million of higher operating losses due to higher production levels in
      2007; and

·

a
      $9 million increase related to PPL's energy services-related businesses;
      partially offset by

(a)

In
      2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply sold their Enron
      Corporation bankruptcy claims that related to past due receivables to
      an independent third party.  In conjunction with the sale, PPL
      Energy Supply reduced the associated allowance for doubtful
      accounts.  PPL Energy Supply remained liable if any of the
      claims were disallowed by the bankruptcy court, under certain
      circumstances.  During 2008, this exposure
    expired.

(b)

In
      2007, Maine Electric Power Company (MEPCO), ISO New England and other New
      England transmission owners submitted a filing to the FERC seeking to roll
      the revenue requirement of the MEPCO transmission facilities into the
      regional transmission rates in New England and to change certain rules
      concerning the use of the transmission line for energy and
      capacity.  PPL protested this proposal and recorded an
      impairment of the transmission rights based on their estimated fair value
      as determined by an internal model and other market
    analysis.

Amortization
of Recoverable Transition Costs

Amortization
of recoverable transition costs decreased by $17 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  Amortization of recoverable transition costs increased by $28
million in 2007 compared with 2006.  The amortization of recoverable
transition costs is based on a PUC amortization schedule, adjusted for ITC and
CTC recoveries in customer rates and related expenses.  Since the
amortization substantially matches the revenue recorded based on recovery in
customer rates, there is minimal impact on earnings.

Discontinued
Operations

Income
from Discontinued Operations decreased by $267 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  The decrease was primarily attributable to gains on the sale of
PPL's Latin American businesses in 2007.  This is also the primary
reason for the increase in Income from Discontinued Operations of $249 million
in 2007 compared with 2006.

See Note
10 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL's
Discontinued Operations.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

In
general, the continued downturn in the financial markets has made obtaining new
sources of bank and capital markets funding difficult and
costly.  During this challenging period, PPL continues to focus on
maintaining a strong credit profile and liquidity position.  PPL
expects to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash
flows, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and its credit
facilities.  PPL currently does not expect to need to access
commercial paper markets or debt and equity capital markets until mid-2009,
except to remarket certain bonds at PPL Energy Supply to unaffiliated investors
as discussed below under "Forecasted Sources of Cash."

PPL's
cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets
are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited
to:

Auction Rate
Securities

PPL had
auction rate securities totaling $24 million at December 31, 2008, which
were classified as "Investments - Other," and $15 million and $153 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, which were classified as "Short-term investments" on
the Balance Sheets.  Historically, an active market existed for such
investments, and the auctions provided an opportunity for investors either to
hold an investment at a periodically reset interest rate or to sell the
investment at its par value for immediate liquidity.  In early 2008,
investor concerns about credit and liquidity in the financial markets,
generally, as well as investor concerns over specific insurers that guarantee
the credit of certain of the underlying securities, created uncertainty in the
auction rate securities market and these securities generally failed to be
remarketed through their established auction process.  These auction
failures and the resulting illiquidity continue to impact PPL's investment in
auction rate securities.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL concluded that the fair value of its auction rate
securities was $24 million, a temporary decline of $5 million from par
value.  Because PPL intends and has the ability to hold these auction
rate securities until they can be liquidated at par value, PPL believes that it
does not have significant exposure to realize losses on these
securities.  Based upon the evaluation of available information, PPL
believes these investments continue to be of high credit
quality.  Additionally, PPL does not anticipate having to sell these
securities to fund operations.  As such, the decline in fair value is
deemed temporary due to general market conditions.  See Note 18 to the
Financial Statements for further discussion of auction rate
securities.

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased by 1%, or $18 million, in 2008
compared with 2007, primarily as a result of higher revenues, primarily due to
the hedged sale of generation in the wholesale market, increased retail electric
sales volumes and a 1.4% increase in domestic delivery sales prices, as well as
less U.S. income tax payments, primarily as a result of a refund received in
2008, and operating losses incurred in 2007 in connection with synfuel projects
that ceased operation at the end of 2007.  The increases to cash
provided by operating activities resulting from these items were partially
offset by increased expenditures for fuel, primarily due to higher coal prices,
lower realized net energy trading margins, driven by significant decreases in
power and gas prices, higher interest paid, primarily due to higher debt levels
in 2008, cash flows provided by Latin America's operations in 2007 but not 2008,
due to the sale of the Latin American businesses in 2007, and an insurance
recovery of storm costs in 2007.

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased by 11%, or $187 million, in 2007
compared with 2006, primarily as a result of increased expenditures for fuel and
increased U.S. income tax payments, a portion of which related to taxes incurred
in connection with the sale of PPL's Latin American businesses, partially offset
by higher revenues in 2007 compared with 2006.  The higher revenues
resulted primarily from higher wholesale market prices for electricity in the
U.S. and increased domestic sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of
favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial sales and normal load
growth.

PPL
expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating activities as
a result of its power sales commitments from wholesale and retail customers,
long-term fuel purchase contracts and contracts to procure electricity in
2010.  PPL estimates that, on average, approximately 95% of its
expected annual generation output for 2009 is committed under power sales
contracts.  PPL has and will continue to layer in power sales
contracts in the wholesale markets for the capacity and energy currently
committed under the PLR supply contracts with PPL Electric, which expire at the
end of 2009.  Based on the way in which the wholesale markets have
developed over the last several years, PPL expects that new contracts are likely
to continue to be of a shorter duration than the PLR supply contracts, which at
inception had terms of approximately nine years.

As
discussed in the "Overview," pursuant to a plan approved by the PUC, PPL
Electric has entered into contracts to procure two-thirds of the 2010
electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers.  If proposed legislation to extend
generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods gets passed,
there could be negative consequences to PPL's cash from operations.

PPL's
contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash
collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or terminations of a
portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a
downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in
market prices.  For example, in addition to limiting its trading
ability, if PPL's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment
grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL estimates that, based on its
December 31, 2008 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of
approximately $815 million, compared with $829 million at December 31,
2007.  PPL has in place risk management programs that are designed to
monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes
in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating
units.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2008 and projected expenditures for the years 2009
through 2013.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 165%, or $1.0 billion, in 2008 compared
with 2007, as PPL received $303 million from the sale of PPL's gas and propane
businesses in 2008 compared to aggregate proceeds of $898 million received from
the sale of PPL's Latin American businesses and telecommunication operations in
2007.  Additionally, there was a change of $354 million from purchases
and sales of other investments and a change of $359 million from purchases and
sales of intangible assets.  The increase in cash used in investing
activities from the above items was partially offset by a decrease of $239
million in capital expenditures and a decrease of $54 million in the amount of
cash that became restricted.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 62%, or $1.0 billion, in 2007 compared
with 2006 primarily as a result of aggregate proceeds of $898 million received
from the sale of PPL's Latin American businesses and telecommunication
operations in 2007 compared to $110 million received from the sale of its
interest in the Griffith plant in 2006, as well as a change of $555 million from
purchases and sales of other investments and a change of $79 million from
purchases and sales of intangible assets.  These increases were
partially offset by an increase of $263 million in capital expenditures,
primarily as a result of construction of pollution control equipment at
coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, and an increase of $113 million in the
additional amount of cash that became restricted.

Financing
Activities

Net cash
provided by financing activities was $721 million in 2008, compared with $1.3
billion of cash used in financing activities in 2007 and net cash provided by
financing activities of $95 million in 2006.  The change from 2007 to
2008 primarily reflects increased issuances and lower retirements of long-term
debt, lower repurchases of common stock and increased short-term borrowings in
2008.  The change from 2006 to 2007 primarily reflects reduced
issuances of long-term debt and equity securities in 2007, as well as
repurchases of common stock under a $750 million stock repurchase program
approved by PPL's Board of Directors in June 2007.

In 2008,
cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances
of $1.3 billion and $19 million of common stock sale proceeds, partially offset
by common and preferred dividends paid of $509 million and the repurchase of
802,816 shares of common stock for $38 million.

In 2007,
cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of
$170 million, the repurchase of 14,929,892 shares of common stock for $712
million and common and preferred dividends paid of $477 million, partially
offset by $32 million of common stock sale proceeds.  See Note 8 to
the Financial Statements for a discussion of the common stock repurchase
program.

In 2006,
cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances
of $277 million, net proceeds of $245 million from the issuance of preference
stock and $21 million of common stock sale proceeds, partially offset by common
and preferred dividends paid of $421 million.  See Note 7 to the
Financial Statements for information regarding the preference stock issued by
PPL Electric.

See
"Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans to issue debt and
equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available
to PPL.  Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's
plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred securities in the future, as
well as maturities of PPL's long-term debt.

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near
term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper program and
operating leases.  PPL currently does not expect to need to access
commercial paper markets or debt and equity capital markets until mid-2009,
except to remarket certain bonds at PPL Energy Supply to unaffiliated investors
as discussed below.

In
addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit
agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other
covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable
grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or
termination of the agreements.  PPL monitors compliance with the
covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2008, PPL was in
material compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL believes
that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to
these funding sources.

See Note
8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL's credit
facilities.

During
2009, PPL currently intends to take the following actions as it relates to its
committed borrowing capacity:  increase PPL Energy Supply's capacity
up to a maximum total of $5.0 billion through traditional bank or
structured-type credit facilities, which includes the renewal or extension of
certain facilities that expire in 2009; renew PPL Electric's existing $150
million asset-backed credit facility to maintain its current total capacity
level; and increase WPD's capacity up to a maximum total of £355 million, which
includes the renewal and extension of certain facilities that expire in
2009.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric usually maintain commercial paper programs, under
which commercial paper issuances are supported by certain credit facilities of
each company, to provide an additional financing source to fund their short-term
liquidity needs, if and when necessary.  During 2008, PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric had commercial paper programs in place for up to $500
million for PPL Energy Supply and for up to $200 million for PPL
Electric.  Neither PPL Energy Supply nor PPL Electric had commercial
paper outstanding at December 31, 2008.

As
discussed below under "Credit Ratings," S&P lowered its rating on PPL Energy
Supply's commercial paper to A-3 from A-2 in January 2009.  Based on
its current cash position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Energy Supply
currently does not expect to need to issue any commercial paper during
2009.  As a result of this expectation, coupled with the lack of
liquidity in commercial paper markets for paper with an A-3 rating, in January
2009, PPL Energy Supply closed its commercial paper program and requested that
Moody's, S&P and Fitch each withdraw their ratings on its commercial paper
program, which each rating agency subsequently did.

As noted
below under "Credit Ratings," commercial paper for PPL Electric is rated P-2,
A-2 and F2 by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.  Liquidity in the markets
for commercial paper with these ratings became extremely limited during the
second half of 2008 as a result of the downturn in the financial
markets.  Liquidity for commercial paper with these ratings has
improved thus far in 2009, but it is still somewhat difficult and costly for PPL
Electric to issue commercial paper.  Based on its current cash
position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Electric currently does not expect to
need to issue any commercial paper during 2009, but it may do so from time to
time to facilitate short-term cash flow needs if market conditions
improve.

Operating
Leases

PPL and
its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through
operating leases.  PPL's subsidiaries lease office space, land,
buildings and certain equipment.  These leasing structures provide PPL
additional operating and financing flexibility.  The operating leases
contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining
insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other
fees.

PPL,
through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1
and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating
leases.  These operating leases are not recorded on PPL's Balance
Sheets.  The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's
ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare
dividends.  At this time, PPL believes that these restrictions will
not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination
of the leases.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of other dividend restrictions related to PPL
subsidiaries.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
leases.

Long-Term
Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
to market conditions in 2009, PPL and its subsidiaries currently plan to issue
up to $300 million in long-term debt securities and to remarket to unaffiliated
investors $150 million of tax-exempt bonds issued by the PEDFA in December 2008
on behalf of PPL Energy Supply and for which a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply
acted as initial purchaser.  PPL Electric prefunded a portion of its
2009 financing needs through the issuance of $400 million of Senior Secured
Bonds in October 2008, which will partially fund an approximately $486 million
bond maturity in August 2009.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements
for further discussion of the tax-exempt bonds issued by the PEDFA as well as
the prefunding of PPL Electric's 2009 debt maturity.  PPL expects to
use the proceeds from the issuance and remarketing of long-term debt securities
primarily to fund capital expenditures, to partially fund redemptions of
existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

PPL
currently plans to issue new shares of common stock in 2009 in an aggregate
amount of approximately $75 million under various employee stock-based
compensation plans and its dividend reinvestment plan.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL currently expects to incur future
cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment
of dividends on its common and preferred securities and the purchase of a
portion of certain of PPL Energy Supply's debt
securities.

PPL's
capital expenditure projections for the years 2009 through 2013 total

periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  In light of current economic conditions, including the
high cost of capital, and projections of future energy prices, certain projects
previously included in this table have been cancelled or completion dates have
been delayed.  This table includes projected costs related to the
planned 148 MW incremental capacity increases and the PJM-approved regional
transmission line expansion project.  See Note 9 to the Financial
Statements for information on the PJM-approved regional transmission line
expansion project and the cancellation of the Holtwood hydroelectric plant
expansion project.

PPL plans
to fund its capital expenditures in 2009 with cash on hand, cash from operations
and the remarketing and issuance of debt securities.

Dividends

PPL views
dividend growth as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to
continue its trend of common stock dividend increases.  In 2008, PPL
increased the annualized dividend rate on its common stock from $1.22 to $1.34
per share, effective with the April 1, 2008 dividend payment.  In 2009, PPL
increased the annualized dividend rate on its common stock from $1.34 to $1.38
per share, effective with the April 1, 2009 dividend payment.  Future
dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will
depend upon available earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other
relevant factors at the time.  As discussed in Note 8 to the Financial
Statements, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend on its common stock
during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its
2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067.  No such deferrals
have occurred or are currently anticipated.

PPL
Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

See Note
8 to the Financial Statements for other restrictions related to distributions on
capital interests for PPL subsidiaries.

Purchase
of Debt Securities

On
February 17, 2009, PPL Energy Supply initiated cash tender offers for up to $250
million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding senior
notes.  The series of notes, in order of their priority level for
acceptance by PPL Energy Supply, are as follows:  6.00% Senior Notes
due 2036, 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 and 5.40% Senior Notes due
2014.  The tender offer for each series of notes expires on March 16,
2009.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
preferred securities of PPL and its subsidiaries.  Based on their
respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings
revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it
issues.  The credit ratings of PPL and its subsidiaries are based on
information provided by PPL and other sources.  The ratings of
Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any
securities of PPL or its subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to
revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated
independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the
securities.  A downgrade in PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings
could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
markets.

Moody's
and S&P did not take any actions related to PPL and its rated subsidiaries
during 2008.  Fitch took the following actions in 2008:

·

In
      March 2008, Fitch completed a review of its credit ratings for PPL, PPL
      Capital Funding, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric and affirmed all
      ratings related to these entities, with the exception that it lowered the
      preferred stock rating of PPL Electric to BBB from BBB+.  Fitch
      stated in the related press release that the lower preferred stock rating
      reflects its junior position in the capital structure and does not reflect
      any change in credit quality.

·

In
      May 2008, Fitch changed its outlook for WPDH Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South
      Wales) and WPD (South West) to positive from stable.

·

In
      August 2008, Fitch affirmed its BBB rating of PPL Montana's 8.903%
      Pass-Through Certificates due 2020.

In
January 2009, S&P completed a review of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric and revised its outlook for all three entities to negative from
stable.  At that time, S&P affirmed the BBB issuer rating of both
PPL and PPL Energy Supply and affirmed the A- issuer rating of PPL
Electric.  As a result of the negative outlook at PPL Energy Supply,
S&P lowered the commercial paper rating of PPL Energy Supply to A-3 from
A-2.  S&P stated in its press release regarding PPL and PPL Energy
Supply that the revision in the outlook for PPL and PPL Energy Supply is based
primarily on lower than expected cash flows for 2008 combined with concerns over
further pressure on financial metrics in 2009.  S&P stated in its
press release regarding PPL Electric that the revision in its outlook reflects
the linkage with PPL along with their expectation that PPL Electric's financial
metrics could weaken beginning in 2010.

At the
request of PPL Energy Supply, Fitch, in January 2009, and Moody's and S&P,
in February 2009, each withdrew their commercial paper rating for PPL Energy
Supply.

In
February 2009, S&P revised its outlook to negative from stable for each of
WPDH Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West) and affirmed the
issuer and short-term debt ratings of each of the entities.  S&P
stated in its press release that the revision in the outlook is a reflection of
the change to PPL's outlook and is not a result from any change in WPD's
stand-alone credit profile.

Ratings
Triggers

WPD
(South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material
adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD
(South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled $722 million at
December 31, 2008.

PPL does
not have additional material liquidity exposures caused by a ratings downgrade
that would accelerate the due dates of borrowings.  However, PPL has
various other contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of
electricity and fuel, surety bonds and interest rate and foreign currency
trades, which contain provisions requiring PPL to post collateral or other
credit enhancements, or provide for reductions or terminations of a portion of
the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a ratings
downgrade.  If PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings had been
below investment grade at December 31, 2008, PPL would have had to post an
additional $874 million of collateral to counterparties.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

PPL
provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements
that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees contain
financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the
consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time,
PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding
sources.

PPL has
entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of FIN
45.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
guarantees.

Risk
Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
Risk

Background

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL may incur as a result of price changes associated
with a particular financial or commodity instrument.  PPL is exposed
to market risk from:

·

commodity
      price risk for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale
      of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity marketing
      activities, and the purchase of fuel for generating assets and energy
      trading activities;

·

interest
      rate and price risk associated with debt used to finance operations, as
      well as debt and equity securities in PPL's nuclear decommissioning trust
      funds and PPL's defined benefit plans; and

·

foreign
      currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in U.K.
      affiliates, as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than
      U.S. dollars.

PPL has a
risk management policy approved by its Board of Directors to manage market risk
and counterparty credit risk.  Credit risk is discussed
below.  The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the
Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations and
other risk management metrics.

The
forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur
in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on
model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from
those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of
expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible
losses.

Contract
Valuation

PPL
utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured
deals, such as tolling agreements, as part of its risk management strategy to
minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price,
interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

Effective January 1,
2008, PPL adopted SFAS 157, as discussed in Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial
Statements.  SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a
framework for measuring fair value.  When available, quoted market
prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial
instrument.  This may include exchange prices, quotes obtained from
brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source, such as a
bank.  However, market prices for energy or energy-related contracts
may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity.  If no
active trading market exists, contract valuations may include the use of
internally developed models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal
group.  Additionally, PPL considers and incorporates appropriate
credit risk, liquidity risk and modeling risk in its fair value
measurements.  Although PPL believes its valuation methods are
reasonable, changes in underlying assumptions could result in significantly
different values and realization in future periods.

Accounting
and Reporting

To
account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
follows the provisions of SFAS 133, EITF 02-3, and EITF
03-11.  In accordance with SFAS 133, all derivative instruments are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability (unless
they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion), and changes in the derivatives'
fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
criteria are met.

In
accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL reflects its net realized and unrealized gains
and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in
the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of Income.

In
accordance with EITF 03-11, gains and losses associated with non-trading
bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with
purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points.  A
major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing
available.

These
contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  Short-term derivative
positions are included in "Current Assets" and "Current
Liabilities."  Long-term derivative positions are included in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other
Noncurrent Liabilities."

Accounting
Designation

Energy
contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
treatment.  For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a
derivative, the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy
transactions are entered into determine their accounting
designation.  In addition to commodity transactions, PPL enters into
financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest
expense and foreign currency risk associated with both existing and anticipated
debt issuances.  PPL also enters into foreign currency swap contracts
to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and
net investments in foreign operations.  As with commodity
transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the
transaction determine a contract's accounting designation.  These
designations are verified by an independent internal group on a daily
basis.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a summary of the
guidelines used for the accounting designations of derivative energy
contracts.

Commodity
Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
price risk is one of PPL's most significant risks due to the level of investment
that PPL maintains in its generation assets, as well as the extent of its
marketing activities.  Several factors influence price levels and
volatilities.  These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal
changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within
regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions,
market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and
state regulations.

To hedge
the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL's energy-related assets,
liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs
throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
over-the-counter contracts.  PPL's non-trading commodity derivative
contracts mature at various times through 2017.  PPL segregates its
non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and
economic activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge
activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133.  The
majority of PPL's energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge
accounting.

The
economic activity category includes energy derivative transactions that have
previously qualified or could potentially qualify for hedge accounting under
SFAS 133; however, these transactions have either been disqualified from hedge
accounting or management has not elected to designate them as accounting
hedges.  Additionally, this category includes transactions entered
into to optimize the economic value of PPL's generation assets or to hedge its
wholesale or retail load obligations.  The fair value of economic
positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was a net liability of $52 million and
a net asset of $67 million.

Examples
of transactions represented in this category include certain purchase contracts
used to supply full requirements contracts; FTR's or basis swaps used to hedge
basis risk associated with the sale of generation or supplying full requirements
contracts; spark spreads (sale of electricity with the simultaneous purchase of
fuel); retail gas activities; fair value hedges of fuel inventory; and fuel oil
swaps used to hedge price escalation clauses in commodity and transportation
contracts.  PPL also uses options to manage its exposure to market
price risk.  These option strategies include the selling of call
options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating
unit.  Since PPL owns the physical generating unit, its price exposure
is limited to the cost of the particular generating unit and does not expose PPL
to uncovered market price risk.  PPL also purchases call options or
sells put options to create a net purchase position to cover an overall short
position in its non-trading portfolio.  Finally, the change in fair
value of dedesignated cash flow hedges is also included in this category as the
intent of those transactions was for hedging purposes.

In
addition to the transactions and amounts described above, the ineffective
portion of qualifying cash flow hedges is also included in economic
activity.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional
information on economic activity, including the amount of hedge
ineffectiveness.

Within
PPL's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy contracts is
influenced by the expected value of PPL's generation.  In determining
the number of MWhs that are available to be sold forward, PPL reduces the
maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors - planned
maintenance, unplanned outages and economic conditions.  The potential
output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due
to planned maintenance on a particular unit.  Another reduction,
representing the unplanned outage rate, is the amount of MWhs that historically
is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment
breakage.  Finally, the potential output of certain plants (such as
peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow
them to economically run during all hours.

PPL's
non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy
contracts.  The net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute
by minute.  Anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are affected
by expected load changes, regional economic drivers and
seasonality.  PPL analyzes historical on-peak and off-peak usage
patterns, expected load changes, regional economic drivers, and weather
patterns, among other factors, to determine monthly levels of a block of
electricity that best fits usage patterns to minimize earnings
volatility.  To satisfy its full requirements obligations, PPL may
enter into contracts to purchase unbundled products of electricity, capacity,
renewable energy credits and other ancillary products.  Alternatively,
PPL may reserve a block amount of generation for full requirements contracts
that is expected to be the best match with anticipated usage patterns and energy
peaks.

The
following chart sets forth the net fair market value of PPL's non-trading
commodity derivative contracts.  At December 31, 2008, these amounts
reflect fair value as defined by SFAS 157.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the
Financial Statements for additional information.

The
sources of fair value are consistent with the three levels of the fair value
hierarchy as specified by SFAS 157:

Because
of PPL's efforts to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets, PPL
sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward
basis, resulting in open contractual positions.  If PPL were unable to
deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its
agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay
damages.  These damages would be based on the difference between the
market price and the contract price of the commodity.  Depending on
price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be
significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant
outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their
own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could
affect PPL's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in
the market price of replacement energy.  Although PPL attempts to
mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully
meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for
failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance
in the future.

Commodity
Price Risk (Trading)

PPL also
executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL may at times create a net open
position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do
not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The margins from
these trading activities are shown in the Statements of Income as "Net energy
trading margins."

PPL's
trading contracts mature at various times through 2014.  The following
chart sets forth the net fair market value of PPL's trading
contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for

VaR
Models

PPL
utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity price risk in its non-trading and
trading portfolios.  This approach is consistent with how PPL's RMC
assesses the market risk of its commodity business.  VaR is a
statistical model that attempts to predict the value of potential loss, under
normal market conditions, based on historical market price
volatility.  PPL calculates VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation
technique, which uses historical data from the past 12-month
period.  The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of earnings based on a
one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval.  At December 31,
the VaR for PPL's portfolio using end-of-quarter results for the year was as
follows:

Commodity
Price Risk Summary

In
accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL often elects not to completely hedge
its generation output or fuel requirements.  PPL estimates that for
its entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical and
financial energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across all
geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected 2009 gross margins by
$16 million.  Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel
prices would decrease expected 2009 gross margins by $20 million.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL and
its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations, which exposes
them to interest rate risk.  PPL utilizes various financial derivative
instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt
portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in benchmark
interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when
appropriate.  Risk limits under the risk management program are
designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes
in the fair value of PPL's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level
of interest rates.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL's potential annual exposure to increased interest
expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $3 million, compared
with $8 million at December 31, 2007.

PPL is
also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt
portfolios.  PPL estimated that a 10% decrease in interest rates at
December 31, 2008 would increase the fair value of its debt portfolio by $327
million, compared with $336 million at December 31, 2007.

PPL
utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the
expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments.  These
risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding
variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing.  While PPL is
exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the
fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified
into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects
earnings.  At December 31, 2008, the fair value of these instruments
was a net liability of $11 million.  PPL estimated that a 10% adverse
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2008 would increase the net liability
by $12 million, compared with an increase in the liability of $11 million at
December 31, 2007.

PPL also
utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and
floating interest rates in its debt portfolio.  The change in fair
value of these instruments, as well as the offsetting change in the value of the
hedged exposure of the debt, is reflected in earnings.  At December
31, 2008, the fair value of these instruments was an asset of $54
million.  PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in interest rates
at December 31, 2008 would decrease the asset by $5 million, compared with $19
million at December 31, 2007.

WPDH
Limited holds a net notional position in cross-currency swaps totaling $302
million to hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S.
dollar-denominated senior notes with maturity dates ranging from December 2017
to December 2028.  While PPL is exposed to changes in the fair value
of these instruments, any change in the fair value of these instruments is
recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
which the item being hedged affects earnings.  The estimated fair
value of this position at December 31, 2008 was a net asset of $54
million.  WPDH Limited estimated that a 10% adverse movement in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates at December 31, 2008
would decrease the net asset by $8 million, compared with an increase of $122
million in the net liability for the cross-currency swaps outstanding at
December 31, 2007.

Foreign
Currency Risk

PPL is
exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in U.K.
affiliates.  In addition, PPL's domestic operations may make purchases
of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL has
adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain
foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or
liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.  In
addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign
currency translation risk of expected earnings.

In 2007,
PPL executed forward contracts to sell British pounds sterling to protect the
value of a portion of its net investment in WPD.  The total notional
amount of the contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 was £68
million.  The settlement dates of these contracts range from March
2009 through June 2011.  At December 31, 2008, the fair value of these
positions was an asset of $34 million.  PPL estimated that a 10%
adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008 would
decrease the asset by $10 million, compared with $18 million at December 31,
2007.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear
station.  At December 31, 2008, these funds were invested
primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities
and are reflected at fair value on PPL's Balance Sheet.  The mix of
securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund Susquehanna's
decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning
costs.  However, the equity securities included in the trusts are
exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate,
fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates.  PPL
actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset
allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy
statement.  At December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 10% increase in
interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an
estimated $27 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared
with a $40 million reduction at December 31, 2007.  See Note 23
to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds.

Defined
Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional
information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan
assets.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by
counterparties of their contractual obligations.  PPL maintains credit
policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including
requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and requires
other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain
circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  However,
PPL has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities,
financial institutions and other energy marketing and trading
companies.  These concentrations may impact PPL's overall exposure to
credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly
affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

As
discussed in "Contract Valuation" above, PPL includes the effect of credit risk
on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a counterparty
will default when contracts are out of the money (from the counterparty's
standpoint).  In this case, PPL would have to sell into a lower-priced
market or purchase from a higher-priced market.  PPL also records an
allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty
will not pay for deliveries PPL has made but not yet billed, which are reflected
in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL also has
established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the California ISO for
which PPL has not yet been paid, which is reflected in accounts receivable on
the Balance Sheets.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

In
September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.  A subsidiary of
Lehman was a counterparty of PPL.  Lehman was a guarantor of the
subsidiary, and because of the bankruptcy, PPL was allowed to declare an event
of default under the contract with the subsidiary.  At the time of
Lehman's filing, PPL's direct exposure to the subsidiary of Lehman was a net
liability of $3 million, pre-tax, which was liquidated prior to December 31,
2008.  PPL believes that the Lehman bankruptcy has not had and will
not have a material adverse effect on PPL or its subsidiaries.

PPL has
assessed the impact of recent market conditions on its fair value measurements
related to certain counterparties other than Lehman, but the decrease in
valuation was not material to PPL's Financial Statements.  At this
time, PPL has not deemed it probable that any of these counterparties will
default.

In 2007,
the PUC approved PPL Electric's post-rate cap plan to procure default
electricity supply for retail customers who do not choose an alternative
competitive supplier in 2010.  PPL Electric's plan provides for the
procurement of the necessary electricity supply for 2010 through a series of six
competitive bid solicitation processes during 2007through 2009.  As of
December 31, 2008, PPL Electric has contracted for two-thirds of the expected
2010 electricity supply requirements for its residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers.  Under the standard Supply Master
Agreement (the Agreement) for the bid solicitation process, PPL Electric
requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an
established credit limit.  In the event a supplier defaults on its
obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the
market.  All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be
recoverable from customers in future rates.  At December 31, 2008, all
of the successful bidders had an investment grade credit rating from S&P,
and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement.  There
is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post
collateral to its suppliers.

See
"Overview" above and Notes 15, 16 and 19 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on the competitive solicitations, the Agreement and
credit concentration.

Related
Party Transactions

PPL is
not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by
senior management of PPL, PPL Energy Supply or PPL Electric in outside
partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or
other entities doing business with PPL.

Acquisitions,
Development and Divestitures

PPL
continuously evaluates strategic options for its business segments and, from
time to time, PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third
parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets, joint
ventures and development projects, which may or may not result in definitive
agreements.  Any such transactions may impact future financial
results.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the Financial Statements for
information regarding such recent transactions.

In 2008,
PPL increased the capacity of several existing generating
facilities.  The aggregate capacity increase was 66 MW.  PPL
is currently planning additional incremental capacity increases of 148 MW
primarily at its existing generating facilities.  See Note 9 to the
Financial Statements for additional information on the progress of the PPL
Susquehanna nuclear plant uprate project.  Offsetting the planned
capacity increases is an expected reduction of up to 30 MW in net generation
capability at the Brunner Island plant due to the estimated increase in station
service usage during scrubber operation.  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for additional information.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  The tolling agreement extends through 2021 and is
considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes that was determined to be
an operating lease.  As a result of this agreement, PPL EnergyPlus
recognized an intangible asset.  See Notes 11 and 21 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

PPL
continuously reexamines development projects based on market conditions and
other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or
expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other
options.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL's
financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods,
assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting
policies.  The following accounting policies are particularly
important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, and
require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments included
within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the
information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are
also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements).  PPL's senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and
assumptions regarding them with its Audit Committee.  In addition, PPL's
senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the
application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee.

SFAS

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides a definition of fair value as well as a
framework for measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB
amended SFAS 157, as originally issued, through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1
and FSP FAS 157-2.  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its
scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 was effective upon issuance and
delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually).  In October 2008, the FASB further amended
SFAS 157 through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-3, which was effective upon
issuance and amends SFAS 157 to clarify its application in a market that is not
active.

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL partially applied SFAS 157, prospectively,
effective January 1, 2008.  PPL adopted FSP FAS 157-3,
prospectively, effective July 1, 2008.  The partial application of
SFAS 157 primarily affected fair value measurement concepts used or embedded in
PPL's critical accounting policies related to "Price Risk Management" and
"Defined Benefits."  PPL's election to defer the application of SFAS
157 for eligible assets and liabilities will primarily affect the fair value
component of PPL's critical accounting policies related to "Asset Impairment"
and "Asset Retirement Obligations" in 2009.  See Notes 1 and 18 to the
Financial Statements for additional information regarding SFAS 157.

Defined
Benefits

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans applicable to the majority of the employees of PPL and its
subsidiaries.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 when
accounting for these defined benefits.  In addition, PPL adopted the
recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 effective
December 31, 2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL
and its subsidiaries are required to record an asset or liability to recognize
the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI
or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit
plans is now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL no longer recognizes
additional minimum liability adjustments in OCI.  See Note 13 to
the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the
accounting for defined benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated
results are recorded in OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets for certain
regulated subsidiaries are amortized to income over future
periods.  This delayed recognition in income of actual results allows
for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who
benefit under the plans.  The primary assumptions are:

·

Discount
      Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of
      benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in
      the future.

The
      objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the
      single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of
      high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash
      flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL starts
with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 300 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$275 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2008, PPL increased the discount
rate for its domestic pension plans from 6.39% to 6.50% as a result of this
assessment and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit
plans from 6.26% to 6.45%.

A similar
process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its
base.  At December 31, 2008, PPL increased the discount rate for the
WPD pension plans from 6.37% to 7.47% as a result of this
assessment.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the
plans.  At December 31, 2008, PPL's expected return on plan assets was
reduced from 8.25% to 8.0% for its domestic pension plans and decreased from
7.80% to 7.0% for its other postretirement benefit plans.  For the WPD
plans, PPL's expected return on plan assets remained at 7.90% at
December 31, 2008.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2008, PPL's
rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic
plans.  For the WPD plans, PPL's rate of compensation increase was
decreased from 4.25% to 4.0% at December 31, 2008.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2008 PPL's
health care cost trend rates were 8.40% for 2009, gradually declining to 5.50%
for 2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  While the charts below reflect either an increase or
decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued
defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined
benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated subsidiaries by
a similar amount in the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below
reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption
and does not include income tax effects.

December 31, 2008, PPL had recorded the following defined benefit plan
liabilities:

In 2008,
PPL recognized net periodic defined benefit costs charged to operating expenses
of $56 million.  This amount represents a $46 million decrease from
2007.  This decrease in expense was primarily attributable to
decreased amortization from AOCI of prior losses for WPD's
plans.

3)
Asset Impairment

PPL
performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets that are subject to
depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, in accordance
with SFAS 144 (indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least
annually in accordance with SFAS 142).

For a
long-lived asset to be held and used, PPL tests for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value
may not be recoverable.  Examples of such events or changes in
circumstances are:

For a
long-lived asset to be held and used, an impairment exists when the carrying
value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the
asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying
value to its estimated fair value.

For a
long-lived asset held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying value of
the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to
sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss
is recorded to adjust the asset (disposal group)'s carrying value to its
estimated fair value less cost to sell.  A gain is recognized for any
subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the
cumulative impairment previously recognized.

In
determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
value of the assets and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those
identified and recorded in the financial statements.  For determining
fair value, the FASB has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets
are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are
unavailable, PPL considers all valuation techniques appropriate in the
circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be
obtained.  PPL has generally used discounted cash flow to estimate
fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when
available.  Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future
cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the
present value of the cash flow streams.

PPL
considers alternate courses of action to recover the carrying value of a
long-lived asset, and uses estimated cash flows from the "most likely"
alternative to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most
likely outcome.  If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a
probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash
flows from the alternatives.  For assets tested for impairment as of
the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test
consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet
date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the
assets.  That assessment is not revised based on events that occur
after the balance sheet date.

In 2008,
PPL recorded impairments of certain long-lived assets.  See Note 9 to
the Financial Statements for a discussion of an impairment related to the
cancellation of a generation capacity increase project.  See Note 10
to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the impairment of the natural
gas distribution and propane businesses.

PPL
performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS
142.  SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level.  PPL has determined its reporting units to be at
or one level below its operating segments.  PPL performs an annual
impairment test for goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be
greater than the unit's fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The
second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of
goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That
is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was
the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied
fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying
value of that goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the implied
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the
reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2008,
PPL was required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test for
its U.K. reporting unit.  This assessment did not result in an
impairment charge, as the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying
value of goodwill.  Management primarily used undiscounted cash flows,
which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the U.K.
reporting unit's assets and liabilities as well as the U.K. reporting unit's
fair value.  The fair value measurement concepts of SFAS 157 were
applied to determine the fair value of applicable financial assets and
liabilities.  A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, or an
increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points, would not have resulted in an
impairment of goodwill.

PPL also
performs a review of the residual value of certain leased assets in accordance
with SFAS 13.  PPL tests the residual value of these assets
annually.  The residual value is defined by SFAS 13 as the estimated
fair value of the leased property at the end of the lease term.  If
the review produces a lower estimate of residual value than was originally
recorded, PPL is required to determine whether the decline is
other-than-temporary.  If it is other-than-temporary, the residual
value will be revised using the new estimate.  This reduction in the
residual value will be recognized as a loss in the period in which the estimate
was changed.  If the review provides a higher estimate of residual
value than was originally recorded, no adjustment will be made.

In
testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
assumptions to estimate:  future cash flows; the useful lives of the
leased assets; fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in
significantly different outcomes from those identified and recorded in the
financial statements.  PPL uses discounted cash flow to determine the
estimated fair value of the leased assets at the end of the lease
term.

In 2008,
PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain leased
assets.  This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes to the
residual value.  PPL's estimate was based on using projections of
electric and fuel prices and any firm sale and purchase
agreements.  An increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points or a
10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would have resulted in an
insignificant reduction of the residual value of these leased assets if it was
determined that the reduction was other-than-temporary.

4)
Leasing

PPL and
its subsidiaries apply EITF 01-8 to determine whether an arrangement contains a
lease within the scope of SFAS 13.  PPL applies the provisions of SFAS
13 to all transactions that qualify for lease accounting.  In
addition, PPL applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements
that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting
for various leasing arrangements.  In general, there are two types of
leases from a lessee's perspective:  operating leases (leases
accounted for off-balance sheet); and capital leases (leases capitalized on the
balance sheet).

In
accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or
capital.  Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference
between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital
lease, thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the
financial statements.

In
addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
they involve:  real estate and/or related integral equipment;
sale/leaseback accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously
owned the leased assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating
lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax
accounting purposes); and lessee involvement in the construction of leased
assets.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  The tolling agreement extends through 2021 and is
considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes that was determined to be
an operating lease.  See Notes 11 and 21 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.  If this transaction were to be accounted
for as a capital lease, PPL would have recorded approximately $269 million of
additional assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet at December 31,
2008.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
leases.

5)
Loss Accruals

PPL
periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions,
situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes.  PPL's
accounting for such events is prescribed by SFAS 5 and other related accounting
guidance.  SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing condition,
situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or
loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future
events occur or fail to occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  PPL does not record the accrual
of contingencies that might result in gains, unless recovery is
assured.  PPL continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for
environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other
events.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial
identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering
events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as
to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these
aspects require significant judgment by PPL's management.

PPL uses
its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers), as
necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and
the amount (or range) of the loss.

Significant
judgment was required by PPL's management to perform an assessment of the
contingency related to the Montana hydroelectric litigation.

In June
2008, PPL's management assessed the loss exposure related to the Montana
hydroelectric litigation, given the June 2008 decision by the Montana First
Judicial District Court (District Court).  The District Court awarded
compensation of approximately $34 million for the years 2000 through 2006, and
approximately $6 million for 2007 as rent for the use of the State of Montana's
streambeds by PPL Montana's hydroelectric facilities.  The District
Court also deferred the determination of compensation for 2008 and subsequent
years to the Montana State Land Board (Land Board).

In
October 2008, PPL Montana filed an appeal of the decision to the Montana Supreme
Court and a stay of judgment, including a stay of the Land Board's to assess
compensation against PPL Montana for 2008 and future periods.  PPL
Montana timely filed its opening appellate in February 2009.

PPL's
management concluded, based on its assessment and after consultations with its
trial counsel, that it has meritorious arguments on appeal for the years 2000
through 2006.  PPL assessed the likelihood of a loss for these years
as reasonably possible.  However, PPL Montana has not recorded a loss
accrual for these years, as the likelihood of a loss was not deemed
probable.

For 2007
and subsequent years, PPL's management believes that while it also has
meritorious arguments, it is probable that its hydroelectric projects will be
subject to annual estimated compensation ranging from $300,000 to $6
million.  Given that there was no single amount within that range more
likely than any other, PPL Montana is annually accruing $300,000.

PPL will
continue to assess the loss exposure for the Montana hydroelectric litigation in
future periods.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on this contingency.

PPL has
identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but that do not
meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5.  SFAS 5 requires
disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably
possible" that a loss has been incurred.  The FASB defines "reasonably
possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or events occurring
is more than remote but less than likely."  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that
have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS 5.

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL identifies, where applicable, the triggering
events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The triggering
events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances
      for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after
      prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of
      the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately
      collected.

·

Environmental
      and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is
      resolved and PPL makes actual payments, a better estimate of the loss is
      determined or the loss is no longer considered
  probable.

PPL
reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded
potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves ongoing
communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
operation management and other parties.

6)
Asset Retirement Obligations

SFAS 143
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements.  The
initial obligation should be measured at its estimated fair value.  An
equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the
capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the
asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability should be
increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement,
for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.

FIN 47
clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS 143.  FIN 47
specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair
value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to
calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed through consideration
of estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the
anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was
incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different
results than those identified and recorded in the financial
statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect
the carrying value of various AROs and the related assets, are reviewed
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the
latest estimate of the obligations.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL had AROs totaling $389 million recorded on the Balance
Sheet.  Of this amount, $322 million, or 83%, relates to PPL's nuclear
decommissioning ARO.  PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding
AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation
rates.  A variance in the forecasted retirement costs, the discount
rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact on the ARO
liabilities.

The
following chart reflects the sensitivities related to PPL's nuclear
decommissioning ARO liability as of December 31, 2008, associated with a
change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition.  There
is no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or
the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of changing the
assumptions.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the
change based solely on a change in that assumption.

7)
Income Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL's provision for income taxes
primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets,
liabilities and valuation allowances.

PPL and
its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.  The
adoption of FIN 48 altered the methodology PPL previously used to account for
income tax uncertainties.  Effective with the adoption of FIN 48,
uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in
accordance with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 requires significant management judgment to determine the
amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax
position.  FIN 48 requires PPL to evaluate its tax positions following
a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine
whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it
is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will
be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing
authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts
surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to
recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets
the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The benefit
recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of
realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  PPL's management
considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized,
including negotiation of a settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL reassesses its uncertain tax positions by considering
information known at the reporting date.  Based on management's
assessment of new information, PPL may subsequently recognize a tax benefit for
a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize a previously recognized tax
position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously recognized tax
position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues
raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and
may materially impact PPL's financial statements in the future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by payment or receipt of cash, within one year of the
reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and
reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate
realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of
factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the
reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized
in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

At
December 31, 2008, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by between $23 million
and $129 million for PPL.  This decrease could result from subsequent
recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax
positions related to the creditability of foreign taxes, the timing and
utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum
tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions,
intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  The events that
could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities,
litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and
the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.

PPL ENERGY SUPPLY, LLC

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
Energy Supply is an energy company with headquarters in Allentown,
PA.  Please refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for descriptions
of PPL Energy Supply's domestic and international businesses.  PPL
Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International
Delivery.  Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply is primarily
engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets - the
northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity in the
U.K.  PPL Energy Supply's overall strategy is to achieve disciplined
growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and
earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in its regulated international
electricity delivery business through efficient operations and strong customer
and regulatory relations.  More specifically, PPL Energy Supply's
strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match
energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths
with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing
exposure to energy and fuel price volatility, counterparty credit risk and
operational risk.

PPL
Energy Supply's strategy for its U.K. electricity delivery business, WPD, is to
own and operate this business at the most efficient cost while maintaining high
quality customer service and reliability.

PPL
Energy Supply faces several risks in its generation business, principally
electricity and capacity wholesale price risk, fuel supply and price risk, power
plant performance, evolving regulatory frameworks and counterparty credit
risk.  PPL Energy Supply attempts to manage these risks through
various means.  For instance, PPL Energy Supply operates a portfolio
of generation assets that is diversified as to geography, fuel source, cost
structure and operating characteristics.  PPL Energy Supply expects to
expand its generation capacity over the next several years through power uprates
at certain of its existing power plants, and is continually evaluating the
potential construction of new plants and the potential acquisition of existing
plants or businesses.  PPL Energy Supply is and will continue to
remain focused on the operating efficiency and availability of its existing and
any newly constructed or acquired power plants.  In addition, PPL
Energy Supply has executed and continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths
for energy sales and fuel supply, while using other means to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse changes in the difference, or margin, between the cost
to produce electricity and the price at which PPL Energy Supply sells
it.  PPL Energy Supply's future profitability will be affected by
whether PPL Energy Supply decides to, or is able to, continue to enter into
long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel purchase agreements or renew
its existing agreements and prevailing market conditions.  Currently,
PPL Energy Supply's commitments for energy sales are satisfied through its own
generation assets and supply purchased from third parties.  PPL Energy
Supply markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets
through integrated generation, marketing and trading functions.

PPL
Energy Supply has adopted risk management programs that, among other things, are
designed to monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility
related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its
generating units.

The
principal challenge that PPL Energy Supply faces in its international
electricity delivery business is to maintain high quality customer service and
reliability in a cost-effective manner.  PPL Energy Supply's
international electricity delivery business is
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, the business is subject to regulatory
risk with respect to the costs that may be recovered and investment returns that
may be collected through customer rates.  PPL Energy Supply faces
additional financial risks in conducting international operations, such as
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  PPL Energy Supply
attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management
programs.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL
Energy Supply's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit
profile.  PPL Energy Supply continually focuses on maintaining an
appropriate capital structure and liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks
PPL Energy Supply faces in its businesses.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Energy Supply's
past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing
the risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

·

"Application
      of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting
      policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and
      financial condition of PPL Energy Supply and that require its management
      to make significant estimates, assumptions and other
      judgments.

In 2007,
PPL sold its regulated electricity delivery businesses in Latin America, which
were included in the International Delivery segment.  See Note 10 to
the Financial Statements for information on the sales.

Market
Events

The
continued downturn in the financial markets has increased the complexity of
managing credit risk, responding to liquidity needs, measuring derivative and
other financial instruments at fair value, and managing market price risk.

Global
bank credit capacity has been reduced dramatically and the cost of renewing or
establishing new credit facilities has increased significantly.  New
bank credit facilities generally are being restricted to less than one-year
terms, thereby introducing uncertainties as to businesses' ability to enter into
long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and
availability of credit.

Commodity Price
Risk

The
volatility of wholesale energy prices due to the continued financial downturn
significantly impacted PPL Energy Supply's 2008 earnings.  See
"Statement of Income Analysis - Domestic Gross Energy Margins - Domestic Gross
Energy Margins By Region" for further discussion.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL Energy Supply would incur a loss as a result of
nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations.  PPL Energy Supply maintains credit policies and
procedures to limit counterparty credit risk.  The continued
volatility and downturn in financial and commodity markets during 2008 have
generally increased PPL Energy Supply's exposure to credit risk.  See
Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information about credit
concentration and "Risk Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other –
Credit Risk" for more information on credit risk.

Liquidity
Issues

The
continued downturn in financial markets has generally made obtaining new sources
of bank and capital markets funding difficult and costly.  During this
challenging period, PPL Energy Supply expects to continue to have access to
adequate sources of liquidity through operating cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and its credit facilities.  Other
than noted below, PPL Energy Supply currently does not expect to need to access
capital markets during 2009, but may do so, subject to market conditions, to
enhance its liquidity.  PPL Energy Supply plans to remarket to
unaffiliated investors, subject to market conditions, $150 million of tax-exempt
bonds that were issued by the PEDFA in December 2008 on behalf of PPL Energy
Supply and for which a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply acted as initial
purchaser.  See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital
Resources" for an expanded discussion of PPL Energy Supply's liquidity position
and a discussion of financing transactions.

Valuations in Inactive
Markets

The
continued downturn in the financial markets has generally made it difficult for
companies to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in
inactive markets.  Management has reviewed the activity in the energy
and financial markets in which PPL Energy Supply transacts, concluding that
substantially all of these markets were active as of December 31, 2008,
with the exception of the market for auction rate securities.  See
Notes 18 and 23 to the Financial Statements and "Financial Condition - Liquidity
and Capital Resources - Auction Rate Securities" for a discussion of these
investments.

Securities Price
Risk

Declines
in the market price of debt and equity securities resulted in unrealized losses
that have reduced the asset values of PPL Energy Supply's investments in its
nuclear decommissioning trust funds and defined benefit plans.  The
nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds experienced negative investment
returns during 2008.  The assets in these funds support the cost to
decommission the Susquehanna nuclear plant when its licenses, subject to any
extensions, expire in 2022 and 2024.  The obligation to decommission
the nuclear plant is long-term in nature, exposing the assets held in the funds
to price risk.  PPL Energy Supply actively monitors the performance of
the investments held in the funds and periodically reviews the funds' investment
allocations.  See "Financial Condition - Risk Management - Energy
Marketing & Trading and Other - Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds -
Securities Price Risk" for additional information on securities price
risk.

PPL
Energy Supply's subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit plans and
participate in and are allocated costs from defined benefit plans sponsored by
PPL.  These plans experienced negative investment returns in 2008,
impacting the funded status of the plans as disclosed in Note 13 to the
Financial Statements.  Determination of the funded status of defined
benefit plans, contribution requirements and net periodic defined benefit costs
for future years is subject to changes in several assumptions, including the
performance of the assets in the plans.  See "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for a discussion of the assumptions and
sensitivities regarding those assumptions.

Outlook

Excluding
special items and the impact of the cost reduction initiative discussed below,
PPL Energy Supply projects higher earnings for its Supply business segment in
2009 compared with 2008, driven by higher energy margins, despite higher
expected coal expense, as a result of higher baseload generation; higher Western
U.S. energy sales prices; and higher expected margins from its marketing and
trading activities.  The Supply segment also expects to incur higher
operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and financing costs in
2009.

See Note
26 to the Financial Statements for additional information on a cost reduction
initiative completed in February 2009.  The Supply segment expects to
achieve annual pre-tax savings of between $14 and $17 million from the reduction
of management and staff positions, including a reduction of costs allocated as a
result of the elimination of positions at PPL Services.

International Delivery
Segment

The
International Delivery segment consists primarily of the distribution of
electricity in the U.K.  In 2007, PPL Energy Supply completed the sale
of its Latin American businesses.  In the first quarter of 2008, the
International Delivery segment recognized income tax adjustments and other
expenses in Discontinued Operations as the dissolution of the remaining Latin
American holding companies commenced.  See Note 10 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

The
International Delivery segment results in 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflect the
reclassification of Latin American revenues and expenses to Discontinued
Operations.

Statement
of Income Analysis --

Domestic
Gross Energy Margins

Non-GAAP Financial
Measure

The
following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure, "Domestic Gross Energy
Margins."  The presentation of "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" is
intended to supplement the investor's understanding of PPL Energy Supply's
domestic non-trading and trading activities by combining applicable income
statement line items and related adjustments to calculate a single financial
measure.  PPL Energy Supply believes that "Domestic Gross Energy
Margins" are useful and meaningful to investors because they provide them with
the results of PPL Energy Supply's domestic non-trading and trading activities
as another criterion in making their investment decisions.  PPL Energy
Supply's management also uses "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" in measuring
certain corporate performance goals used in determining variable
compensation.  Other companies may use different measures to present
the results of their non-trading and trading
activities.  Additionally, "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" are not
intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with
GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  The following
table provides a reconciliation between "Domestic Gross Energy Margins" as
defined by PPL Energy Supply and "Operating Income."

      includes the margins of the Griffith plant prior to its sale in June 2006,
      which is reflected in the Statement of Income in Discontinued
      Operations.

Eastern
U.S.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins were $106 million lower in 2008 compared with
2007.  This decrease was primarily due to higher average fuel prices,
up 16%, primarily due to higher coal prices.  Also contributing to the
decrease was lower baseload generation, down 4%, primarily due to unplanned
outages at the eastern coal-fired units and retirement of the Martins Creek
coal-fired units in September 2007.  Partially offsetting these lower
margins were higher margins from the hedged sale of generation in the wholesale
market and a 1.4% increase in PLR sales prices in accordance with the PUC Final
Order.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins were $109 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to new full requirements supply
contracts and higher wholesale market prices for electricity.  Also
contributing to the improvement was increased generation output from PPL Energy
Supply's nuclear and coal-fired generating facilities.  Nuclear
generation was 2% higher in 2007.  Coal-fired generation was up
slightly in 2007 despite retirement of Martins Creek Units 1 and 2 in
September.

Western
U.S.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins were $8 million higher in 2008 compared with
2007.  This increase was primarily due to increased generation from
the hydroelectric units, up 2%.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins were $27 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to higher market prices for
electricity combined with increased generation from coal-fired generating
facilities.  Coal-fired generation was 6% higher in 2007.

Net
Energy Trading

PPL
Energy Supply enters into energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a
net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if
prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The
margins from these trading activities are reflected in the Statements of Income
as "Net energy trading margins."  These physical and financial
contracts cover trading activity associated with electricity, FTRs, gas and
oil.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $162 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  This decrease consists of $135 million of lower unrealized
margins and $27 million of lower realized margins, both driven by significant
decreases in power and gas prices.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $6 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  Energy trading margins from realized transactions decreased $10
million and were partially offset by a $4 million increase from unrealized
transactions.

Higher
U.K. electric delivery revenues for 2008 compared with 2007, excluding foreign

effective April 1 and favorable changes in customer mix, partially offset by a
decrease in engineering and metering services performed for third
parties.

Higher
U.K. electric delivery revenues for 2007 compared with 2006, excluding foreign
currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to an increase in prices
effective April 1, favorable changes in customer mix and an increase in

partially offset by a 3% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to milder
weather in 2007.

Energy-related
Businesses

Energy-related
businesses contributed $30 million more to operating income in 2008 compared
with 2007.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Energy-related
businesses contributed $29 million more to operating income in 2007 compared
with 2006.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

·

$61
      million of higher pre-tax contributions from synfuel
      projects.  This reflects a $66 million net gain on the
      settlement of options purchased to hedge the risk associated with the
      phase-out of synthetic fuel tax credits and an impairment charge of $10
      million on the synfuel-related assets in 2006, partially offset by $15
      million of higher operating losses due to higher production levels in
      2007; and

·

a
      $9 million increase related to PPL Energy Supply's energy services-related
      businesses; partially offset by

·

a

      party.  In conjunction with the sale, PPL Energy Supply reduced
      the associated allowance for doubtful accounts.  PPL Energy
      Supply remained liable if any of the claims were disallowed by the
      bankruptcy court, under certain circumstances.  During 2008 this
      exposure expired.

In
      2007, Maine Electric Power Company (MEPCO), ISO New England and other New

      regional transmission rates in New England and to change certain rules
      concerning the use of the transmission line for energy and
      capacity.  PPL Energy Supply protested this proposal and
      recorded an impairment of the transmission rights based on their estimated
      fair value as determined by an internal model and other market
      analysis.

Discontinued
Operations

Income
from Discontinued Operations decreased by $302 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  The decrease was primarily attributable to gains on the sale of
PPL Energy Supply's Latin American businesses in 2007.  This is also
the primarily reason for the increase in Income from Discontinued Operations of
$285 million in 2007 compared with 2006.

See Note
10 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL Energy
Supply's Discontinued Operations.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

In
general, continued downturn in the financial markets has made obtaining new
sources of bank and capital markets funding difficult and
costly.  During this challenging period, PPL Energy Supply continues
to focus on maintaining a strong credit profile and liquidity
position.  PPL Energy Supply expects to continue to have adequate
liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and its credit facilities.  PPL Energy Supply
currently does not expect to need to access commercial paper or capital markets
during 2009, except to remarket certain bonds to unaffiliated investors as
discussed below under "Forecasted Sources of Cash," but may decide to access
capital markets, subject to market conditions, to enhance its
liquidity.

PPL
Energy Supply's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and
capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not
limited to:

Auction Rate
Securities

PPL
Energy Supply had auction rate securities totaling $19 million at
December 31, 2008, which were classified as "Investments - Other," and $10
million and $122 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, which were classified as
"Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheets.  Historically, an
active market existed for such investments, and the auctions provided an
opportunity for investors either to hold an investment at a periodically reset
interest rate or to sell the investment at its par value for immediate
liquidity.  In early 2008, investor concerns about credit and
liquidity in the financial markets, generally, as well as investor concerns over
specific insurers that guarantee the credit of certain of the underlying
securities, created uncertainty in the auction rate securities market and these
securities generally failed to be remarketed through their established auction
process.  These auction failures and the resulting illiquidity
continue to impact PPL Energy Supply's investment in auction rate
securities.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply concluded that the fair value of its
auction rate securities was $19 million, a temporary decline of $5 million from
par value.  Because PPL Energy Supply intends and has the ability to
hold these auction rate securities until they can be liquidated at par value,
PPL Energy Supply believes that it does not have significant exposure to realize
losses on these securities.  Based upon the evaluation of available
information, PPL Energy Supply believes these investments continue to be of high
credit quality.  Additionally, PPL Energy Supply does not anticipate
having to sell these securities to fund operations.  As such, the
decline in fair value is deemed temporary due to general market
conditions.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of auction rate securities.

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased by 5%, or $55 million, in 2008
compared with 2007, primarily as a result of increased expenditures for fuel,
primarily due to higher coal prices, lower realized net energy trading margins,
driven by significant decreases in power and gas prices, higher interest paid,
primarily due to higher debt levels in 2008,

and cash
flows provided by Latin America's operations in 2007 but not 2008, due to the
sale of the Latin American businesses in 2007

.  The decreases
to cash provided by operating activities resulting from these items were
partially offset by higher revenues, due primarily to the hedged sale of
generation in the wholesale market, increased sales volumes to PPL Electric
under the PLR contracts to support the PLR load and a 1.4% increase in PLR sales
prices, as well as less U.S. income tax payments, primarily as a result of a
refund received in 2008, and operating losses incurred in 2007 in connection
with synfuel projects that ceased operation at the end of 2007.

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased by 12%, or $146 million, in 2007
compared with 2006, primarily as a result of increased expenditures for fuel and
increased U.S. income tax payments, a portion of which related to taxes incurred
in connection with the sale of PPL Energy Supply's Latin American
businesses.  These increased uses of cash were partially offset by
higher revenues in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily related to higher
wholesale market prices for electricity in the U.S. and increased sales volumes
to PPL Electric under the PLR contracts to support the PLR load.

PPL
Energy Supply expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating
activities as a result of its power sales commitments from wholesale and retail
customers and long-term fuel purchase contracts.  PPL Energy Supply
estimates that, on average, approximately 95% of its expected annual generation
output for 2009 is committed under power sales contracts.  PPL Energy
Supply has and will continue to layer in power sales contracts in the wholesale
markets for the capacity and energy currently committed under the PLR supply
contracts with PPL Electric, which expire at the end of 2009.  Based
on the way in which the wholesale markets have developed over the last several
years, PPL Energy Supply expects that new contracts are likely to continue to be
of a shorter duration than the PLR supply contracts, which at inception had
terms of approximately nine years.

PPL
Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel
often require cash collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or
terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the
event of a downgrade of PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's credit ratings
or adverse changes in market prices.  For example, in addition to
limiting its trading ability, if PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's ratings
were lowered to below "investment grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL
Energy Supply estimates that, based on its December 31, 2008 positions, it would
have had to post additional collateral of approximately $815 million, compared
with $829 million at December 31, 2007.  PPL Energy Supply has in
place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its
exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel
prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit
quality and the operating performance of its generating units.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2008 and projected expenditures for the years 2009
through 2013.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 456%, or $1.4 billion, in 2008 compared
with 2007, as PPL Energy Supply received aggregate proceeds of $898 million from
the sale of its Latin American businesses and telecommunication operations in
2007.  Additionally, there was a change of $329 million from purchases
and sales of other investments, a change of $352 million from purchases and
sales of intangible assets, and an increase of $42 million in the amount of cash
that became restricted.  The increase in cash used in investing
activities from the above items was partially offset by a decrease of $217
million in capital expenditures.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 76%, or $956 million, in 2007 compared
with 2006 primarily as a result of aggregate proceeds of $898 million received
from the sale of PPL Energy Supply's Latin American businesses and
telecommunication operations in 2007 compared to $110 million received from the
sale of its interest in the Griffith plant in 2006, as well as a change of $529
million from purchases and sales of other investments and a change of $79
million from purchases and sales of intangible assets.  These
increases were partially offset by an increase of $298 million in capital
expenditures, primarily as a result of construction of pollution control
equipment at coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, and an increase of $96 million
in the additional amount of cash that became restricted.

Financing
Activities

Net cash
provided by financing activities was $779 million in 2008 compared with $963
million of net cash used in financing activities in 2007 and net cash
provided by financing activities of $315 million in 2006.  The change
from 2007 to 2008 primarily reflects increased issuances and lower retirements
of long-term debt, reduced distributions to and contributions from Member and
increased short-term borrowings in 2008.  The change from 2006 to 2007
primarily reflects reduced issuances of long-term debt and increased
distributions to Member in 2007 in support of the repurchase of PPL common stock
under PPL's stock repurchase program.

In 2008,
cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances
of $1.1 billion and $421 million in contributions from Member, partially offset
by $750 million in distributions to Member.  In 2007, cash used in
financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of $180 million
and $1.5 billion of distributions to Member, partially offset by $700 million in
contributions from Member.  In 2006, cash provided by financing
activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $950 million and $115
million of contributions from Member, partially offset by $712 million in
distributions to Member.

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
Energy Supply expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
in the near term, including various credit facilities, operating leases and
contributions from Member.  PPL Energy Supply currently does not
expect to need to access commercial paper markets or capital markets during
2009, except to remarket certain bonds to unaffiliated investors as discussed
below, but may decide to access capital markets, subject to market conditions,
to enhance its liquidity.

Credit
Facilities

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply's total committed borrowing capacity under
credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit
agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other
covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable
grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or
termination of the agreements.  PPL Energy Supply monitors compliance
with the covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2008, PPL
Energy Supply was in material compliance with these covenants.  At
this time, PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants and other borrowing
conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note
8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL Energy Supply's
credit facilities.

During
2009, PPL Energy Supply currently intends to take the following actions as it
relates to its committed credit facility capacity:  increase its
domestic capacity up to a maximum total of $5.0 billion through traditional bank
or structured-type credit facilities, which includes the renewal or extension of
certain facilities that expire in 2009, and increase WPD's capacity up to a
maximum total of ₤355 million, including the renewal and extension of certain
facilities that expire in 2009.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Energy Supply usually maintains a commercial paper program, under which
commercial paper issuances are supported by its credit facilities, to provide an
additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when
necessary.  During 2008, PPL Energy Supply had a commercial paper
program in place for up to $500 million.  PPL Energy Supply had no
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008.

As
discussed below under "Credit Ratings," S&P lowered its rating on PPL Energy
Supply's commercial paper to A-3 from A-2 in January 2009.  Based on
its current cash position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Energy Supply
currently does not expect to need to issue any commercial paper during
2009.  As a result of this expectation, coupled with the lack of
liquidity in commercial paper markets for paper with an A-3 rating, in January
2009, PPL Energy Supply closed its commercial paper program and requested that
Moody's, S&P and Fitch each withdraw their ratings on its commercial paper
program, which each rating agency subsequently did.

Operating
Leases

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are
provided through operating leases.  PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries
lease office space, land, buildings and certain equipment.  These
leasing structures provide PPL Energy Supply additional operating and financing
flexibility.  The operating leases contain covenants that are typical
for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate
existence and timely payment of rent and other fees.

PPL
Energy Supply, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year,
non-cancelable operating leases.  These operating leases are not
recorded on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets.  The leases place
certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell
assets and declare dividends.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply
believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these funding sources
or cause acceleration or termination of the leases.  See Note 8 to the
Financial Statements for a discussion of other dividend restrictions related to
WPD.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
leases.

Long-Term
Debt Securities and Contributions from Member

PPL
Energy Supply currently does not plan to issue any long-term debt securities,
except to remarket to unaffiliated investors $150 million of tax-exempt bonds
that were issued by the PEDFA in December 2008 on behalf of PPL Energy Supply
and for which a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply acted as initial
purchaser.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of the tax-exempt bonds issued by the PEDFA.  The proceeds
from remarketing of the tax-exempt PEDFA bonds will be used to fund capital
expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

From time
to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Energy Supply's Member,
PPL Energy Funding, makes capital contributions to PPL Energy
Supply.  PPL Energy Supply uses these contributions for general
corporate purposes.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL Energy Supply currently expects to
incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual
obligations, distributions to its Member and the purchase of a portion of
certain of its debt securities.

PPL
Energy Supply's capital expenditure projections for the years 2009 through 2013
total approximately $5.4 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are
revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  In light of current economic conditions, including the
high cost of capital, and projections of future energy prices, certain projects
previously included in this table have been cancelled or completion dates have
been delayed.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for information
on the cancellation of the Holtwood hydroelectric plant expansion
project.  This table includes projected costs related to the planned
148 MW incremental capacity increases.  See Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the installation cost of
scrubbers and other pollution control equipment, which comprise most of the
"Environmental" expenditures noted above.

PPL
Energy Supply plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2009 with cash on
hand, cash from operations, contributions from Member and the remarketing of the
tax-exempt PEDFA bonds.

Contractual

million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding senior
notes.  The series of notes, in order of their priority level for
acceptance by PPL Energy Supply, are as follows:  6.00% Senior Notes
due 2036, 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 and 5.40% Senior Notes due
2014.  The tender offer for each series of notes expires on March 16,
2009.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt securities
of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries.  Based on their respective
independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or
ratings affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it
issues.  The credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries
are based on information provided by PPL Energy Supply and other
sources.  The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL Energy Supply or its
subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal
by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other
and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  A
downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could
result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
markets.

Moody's
and S&P did not take any actions related to PPL Energy Supply and its rated
subsidiaries during 2008.  Fitch took the following actions in
2008:

·

In
      March 2008, Fitch completed a review of its credit ratings for PPL Energy
      Supply and affirmed all of its ratings.

·

In
      May 2008, Fitch changed its outlook for WPDH Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South
      Wales) and WPD (South West) to positive from stable.

·

In
      August 2008, Fitch affirmed its BBB rating of PPL Montana's 8.903%
      Pass-Through Certificates due 2020.

In
January 2009, S&P completed a review of PPL Energy Supply, upon which it
revised its outlook to negative from stable and affirmed its BBB issuer
rating.  As a result of the negative outlook, S&P
lowered PPL Energy Supply's commercial paper rating to A-3 from
A-2.  S&P stated in its press release that the revision in the
outlook for PPL Energy Supply is based primarily on lower than expected
cash flows for 2008

combined
with concerns over further pressure on financial metrics in
2009.

At the
request of PPL Energy Supply, Fitch, in January 2009, and Moody's and S&P,
in February 2009, each withdrew their commercial paper rating for PPL Energy
Supply.

In
February 2009, S&P revised its outlook to negative from stable for each of
WPDH Limited, WPD LLP, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West) and affirmed the
issuer and short-term debt ratings of each of the entities.  S&P
stated in its press release that the revision in the outlook is a reflection of
the change to PPL's outlook to negative from stable and is not a result from any
change in WPD's stand-alone credit profile.

Ratings
Triggers

WPD
(South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material
adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD
(South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled $722 million at December
31, 2008.

PPL
Energy Supply does not have additional material liquidity exposures caused by a
ratings downgrade that would accelerate the due dates of
borrowings.  However, PPL Energy Supply has various other contracts,
including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, and
surety bonds, which contain provisions requiring PPL Energy Supply to post
collateral or other credit enhancements, or provide for reductions or
terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the
event of a ratings downgrade.  If PPL Energy Supply's or its
subsidiaries' credit ratings had been below investment grade at
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply would have had to post an additional
$874 million of collateral to counterparties.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

PPL
Energy Supply provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing
arrangements that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees
contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict
the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time,
PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the
relevant funding sources.

PPL
Energy Supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the
scope of FIN 45.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of guarantees.

Risk
Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
Risk

Background

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of price
changes associated with a particular financial or commodity
instrument.  PPL Energy Supply is exposed to market risk
from:

·

commodity
      price risk for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale
      of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity marketing
      activities, and the purchase of fuel for generating assets and energy
      trading activities;

·

interest
      rate and price risk associated with debt used to finance operations, as
      well as debt and equity securities invested in PPL Energy Supply's nuclear
      decommissioning trust funds and PPL Energy Supply's defined benefit plans;
      and

·

foreign
      currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in U.K.
      affiliates, as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than
      U.S. dollars.

PPL
Energy Supply has a risk management policy approved by PPL's Board of Directors
to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk.  Credit risk is
discussed below.  The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired
by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations and
other risk management metrics.

The
forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur
in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on
model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from
those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of
expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible
losses.

Contract
Valuation

PPL
Energy Supply utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and
structured deals, such as tolling agreements, as part of its risk management
strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

Effective January 1,
2008, PPL Energy Supply adopted SFAS 157, as discussed in Notes 1 and 18 to
the Financial Statements.  SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair
value as well as a framework for measuring fair value.  When
available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a
commodity or financial instrument.  This may include exchange prices,
quotes obtained from brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source,
such as a bank.  However, market prices for energy or energy-related
contracts may not be readily determinable because of market
illiquidity.  If no active trading market exists, contract valuations
may include the use of internally developed models, which are then reviewed by
an independent, internal group.  Additionally, PPL Energy Supply
considers and incorporates appropriate credit risk, liquidity risk and modeling
risk in its fair value measurements.  Although PPL Energy Supply
believes its valuation methods are reasonable, changes in underlying assumptions
could result in significantly different values and realization in future
periods.

Accounting
and Reporting

To
account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
Energy Supply follows the provisions of SFAS 133, EITF 02-3, and EITF
03-11.  In accordance with SFAS 133, all derivative instruments are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability (unless
they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion), and changes in the derivatives'
fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting
criteria are met.

In
accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and
unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for
trading purposes in the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of
Income.

In
accordance with EITF 03-11, gains and losses associated with non-trading
bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with
purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points.  A
major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing
available.

These
contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  Short-term derivative
positions are included in "Current Assets" and "Current
Liabilities."  Long-term derivative positions are included in "Other
Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent
Liabilities."

Accounting
Designation

Energy
contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
treatment.  For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a
derivative, the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy
transactions are entered into determine their accounting
designation.  In addition to commodity transactions, PPL Energy Supply
enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge
interest expense and foreign currency risk associated with both existing and
anticipated debt issuances.  PPL Energy Supply also enters into
foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments
denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign
operations.  As with commodity transactions, the circumstances and
intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract's accounting
designation.  These designations are verified by an independent
internal group on a daily basis.  See Note 19 to the Financial
Statements for a summary of the guidelines used for the accounting designations
of derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
price risk is one of PPL Energy Supply's most significant risks due to the level
of investment that PPL Energy Supply maintains in its generation assets, as well
as the extent of its marketing activities.  Several factors influence
price levels and volatilities.  These factors include, but are not
limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating
assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability within and
between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and
potential federal and state regulations.

To hedge
the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related
assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs
throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
over-the-counter contracts.  PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity
derivative contracts mature at various times through 2017.  PPL Energy
Supply segregates its non-trading activities into two
categories:  hedge activity and economic
activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity
qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133.  The majority
of PPL Energy Supply's energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge
accounting.

The
economic activity category includes energy derivative transactions that have
previously qualified or could potentially qualify for hedge accounting under
SFAS 133; however, these transactions have either been disqualified from hedge
accounting or management has not elected to designate them as accounting
hedges.  Additionally, this category includes transactions entered
into to optimize the economic value of PPL Energy Supply's generation assets or
to hedge its wholesale or retail load obligations.  The net fair value
of economic positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was a net liability of $52
million and a net asset of $67 million.

Examples
of transactions represented in this category include certain purchase contracts
used to supply full requirements contracts; FTR's or basis swaps used to hedge
basis risk associated with the sale of generation or supplying full requirements
contracts; spark spreads (sale of electricity with the simultaneous purchase of
fuel); retail gas activities; fair value hedges of fuel inventory; and fuel oil
swaps used to hedge price escalation clauses in commodity and transportation
contracts.  PPL Energy Supply also uses options to manage its exposure
to market price risk.  These option strategies include the selling of
call options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating
unit.  Since PPL Energy Supply owns the physical generating unit, its
price exposure is limited to the cost of the particular generating unit and does
not expose PPL Energy Supply to uncovered market price risk.  PPL
Energy Supply also purchases call options or sells put options to create a net
purchase position to cover an overall short position in its non-trading
portfolio.  Finally, the change in fair value of dedesignated cash
flow hedges is also included in this category as the intent of those
transactions was for hedging purposes.

In
addition to the transactions and amount described above, the ineffective portion
of qualifying cash flow hedges is also included in economic
activity.  See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional
information on economic activity, including the amount of hedge
ineffectiveness.

Within
PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy
contracts is influenced by the expected value of PPL Energy Supply's
generation.  In determining the number of MWhs that are available to
be sold forward, PPL Energy Supply reduces the maximum potential output that a
plant may produce by three factors - planned maintenance, unplanned outages and
economic conditions.  The potential output of a plant is first reduced
by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a
particular unit.  Another reduction, representing the unplanned outage
rate, is the amount of MWhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to
such factors as equipment breakage.  Finally, the potential output of
certain plants (such as peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of
production will not allow them to run economically during all
hours.

PPL
Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy
contracts.  The net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute
by minute.  Anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are affected
by expected load changes, regional economic drivers and
seasonality.  PPL Energy Supply analyzes historical on-peak and
off-peak usage patterns, expected load changes, regional economic drivers, and
weather patterns, among other factors, to determine monthly levels of a block of
electricity that best fits usage patterns to minimize earnings
volatility.  To satisfy its full requirements obligations, PPL Energy
Supply may enter into contracts to purchase unbundled products of electricity,
capacity, renewable energy credits and other ancillary
products.  Alternatively, PPL Energy Supply may reserve a block amount
of generation for full requirements contracts that is expected to be the best
match with anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks.

The
following chart sets forth the net fair value of PPL Energy Supply's non-trading
commodity derivative contracts.  At December 31, 2008, these
amounts reflect fair value as defined by SFAS 157.  See Notes 18 and
19 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

      2008, PPL Energy Supply refined its valuation approach for FTR and PJM
      basis positions, consistent with PPL Energy Supply's practice of pricing
      other less active trading points, resulting in a $103 million change in
      fair value attributable to changes in valuation

The
sources of fair value are consistent with the three levels of the fair value
hierarchy as specified by SFAS 157:

Because
of PPL Energy Supply's efforts to hedge the value of energy from its generation
assets, PPL Energy Supply sells electricity, capacity and related services and
buys fuel on a forward basis, resulting in open contractual
positions.  If PPL Energy Supply were unable to deliver firm capacity
and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain
circumstances it could be required to pay damages.  These damages
would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price
of the commodity.  Depending on price volatility in the wholesale
energy markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather
conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions,
nonperformance by counterparties (or their own counterparties) with which it has
energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL Energy Supply's ability to
meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of
replacement energy.  Although PPL Energy Supply attempts to mitigate
these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its
firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to
perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the
future.

Commodity
Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
Energy Supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a
net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if
prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The
margins from these trading activities are shown in the Statements of Income as
"Net energy trading margins."

PPL
Energy Supply's trading contracts mature at various times through
2014.  The following chart sets forth the net fair market value of PPL
Energy Supply's trading contracts.  See Notes 18 and 19 to the

      approach for FTR and PJM basis positions, consistent with PPL Energy
      Supply's practice of pricing other less active trading points, resulting
      in changes in valuation
techniques.

PPL

VaR
Models

PPL
Energy Supply utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity price risk in its
non-trading and trading portfolios.  This approach is consistent with
how PPL's RMC assesses the market risk of its commodity business.  VaR
is a statistical model that attempts to predict the value of potential loss,
under normal market conditions, based on historical market price
volatility.  PPL Energy Supply calculates VaR using a Monte Carlo
simulation technique, which uses historical data from the past 12-month
period.  The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of earnings based on a
one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval.  At December 31,
the VaR for PPL Energy Supply's portfolio using end-of-quarter results for the
year was as follows:

Commodity
Price Risk Summary

In
accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL Energy Supply does not completely
hedge its generation output or fuel requirements.  PPL Energy Supply
estimates that for its entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and
physical and financial energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices
across all geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected 2009 gross
margins by $16 million.  Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all
fossil fuel prices would decrease expected 2009 gross margins by $20
million.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations,
which exposes them to interest rate risk.  Both PPL and PPL Energy
Supply manage the interest rate risk of PPL Energy Supply by using various
financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating
interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its
debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future
financing, when appropriate.  Risk limits under the risk management
program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense
and changes in the fair value of PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio due to
changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply's potential annual exposure to increased
interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $2 million,
compared with $3 million at December 31, 2007.

PPL
Energy Supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and
international debt portfolios.  PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10%
decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2008 would increase the fair value of
its debt portfolio by $234 million, compared with $251 million at December 31,
2007.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce PPL
Energy Supply's exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its
debt instruments.  These risks include exposure to adverse interest
rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated
financing.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair
value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these instruments
are recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the same period
during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  At December 31,
2008 and 2007, PPL Energy Supply had none of these instruments
outstanding.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust the
mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt
portfolio.  The change in fair value of these instruments, as well as
the offsetting change in the value of the hedged exposure of the debt, is
reflected in earnings.  At December 31, 2008, the fair value of these
instruments was an asset of $3 million.  PPL Energy Supply estimated
that a 10% adverse movement in interest rates at December 31, 2008 would
decrease the asset by an insignificant amount, compared with $1 million at
December 31, 2007.

WPDH
Limited holds a net notional position in cross-currency swaps totaling $302
million to hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S.
dollar-denominated senior notes with maturity dates ranging from December 2017
to December 2028.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in
the fair value of these instruments, any change in the fair value of these
instruments is recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same
period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.  The
estimated fair value of this position at December 31, 2008 was a net asset
of $54 million.  WPDH Limited estimated that a 10% adverse movement in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates at December 31, 2008 would
decrease the net asset by $8 million, compared with an increase of $122 million
in the net liability for the cross-currency swaps outstanding at December 31,
2007.

Foreign
Currency Risk

PPL
Energy Supply is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments
in U.K. affiliates.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply's domestic
operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S.
dollars.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have adopted a foreign currency risk management program
designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm
commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net
investments.  In addition, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into
financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of
expected earnings.

In 2007,
PPL executed forward contracts to sell British pounds sterling to protect the
value of a portion of PPL Energy Supply's net investment in WPD.  In
connection with these transactions, PPL Energy Supply entered into forward
contracts with PPL that have terms identical to those executed by
PPL.  The total notional amount of the contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2008 was £68 million.  The settlement dates of these
contracts range from March 2009 through June 2011.  At December 31,
2008, the fair value of these positions was an asset of $34
million.  PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement in
foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008 would decrease the asset by
$10 million, compared with $18 million at December 31, 2007.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear
station.  At December 31, 2008, these funds were invested
primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities
and are reflected at fair value on PPL Energy Supply's Balance
Sheet.  The mix of securities is designed to provide returns
sufficient to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for
inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.  However, the equity
securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity
markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to
changes in interest rates.  PPL actively monitors the investment
performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its
nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement.  At December 31,
2008, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity
prices would have resulted in an estimated $27 million reduction in the fair
value of the trust assets, compared with a $40 million reduction at December 31,
2007.  See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Defined
Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional
information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan
assets.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL Energy Supply would incur a loss as a result of
nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations.  PPL Energy Supply maintains credit policies and
procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that
counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and requires other assurances
in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to
limit counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL Energy Supply has
concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial
institutions and other energy marketing and trading companies.  These
concentrations may impact PPL Energy Supply's overall exposure to credit risk,
positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes
in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

As
discussed in "Contract Valuation" above, PPL Energy Supply includes the effect
of credit risk on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a
counterparty will default when contracts are out of the money (from the
counterparty's standpoint).  In this case, PPL Energy Supply would
have to sell into a lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced
market.  PPL Energy Supply also records an allowance for doubtful
accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not pay for
deliveries PPL Energy Supply has made but not yet billed, which are reflected in
"Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL Energy Supply also has
established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the California ISO for
which PPL Energy Supply has not yet been paid, which is reflected in accounts
receivable on the Balance Sheets.  See Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

In
September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.  A subsidiary of
Lehman was a counterparty of PPL Energy Supply.  Lehman was a
guarantor of the subsidiary, and because of the bankruptcy, PPL Energy Supply
was allowed to declare an event of default under the contract with the
subsidiary.  At the time of Lehman's filing, PPL Energy Supply's
direct exposure to the subsidiary of Lehman was a net liability of $3 million,
pre-tax, which was liquidated prior to December 31, 2008.  PPL Energy
Supply believes that the Lehman bankruptcy has not had and will not have a
material adverse effect on PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries.

PPL
Energy Supply has assessed the impact of recent market conditions on its fair
value measurements related to certain counterparties other than Lehman, but the
decrease in valuation was not material to PPL Energy Supply's Financial
Statements.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply has not deemed it
probable that any of these counterparties will default.

Related
Party Transactions

PPL
Energy Supply is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating
responsibility by senior management of PPL Energy Supply in outside
partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or

Acquisitions,
Development and Divestitures

PPL
Energy Supply continuously evaluates strategic options for its business segments
and, from time to time, PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries are involved in
negotiations with third parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets, joint ventures and development projects, which may or may
not result in definitive agreements.  Any such transactions may impact
future financial results.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the
Financial Statements for information regarding such recent
transactions.

In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply increased the capacity of several existing generating
facilities.  The aggregate capacity increase was 66 MW.  PPL
Energy Supply is currently planning additional incremental capacity increases of
148 MW primarily at its existing generating facilities.  See Note 9 to
the Financial Statements for additional information on the progress of the PPL
Susquehanna nuclear plant uprate project.  Offsetting the planned
capacity increases is an expected reduction of up to 30 MW in net generation
capability at the Brunner Island plant due to the estimated increase in station
service usage during scrubber operation.  See Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  The tolling agreement extends through 2021 and is
considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes that was determined to be
an operating lease.  As a result of this agreement, PPL EnergyPlus
recognized an intangible asset.  See Notes 11 and 21 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

PPL
Energy Supply continuously reexamines development projects based on market
conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects,
sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other
options.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL
Energy Supply's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by
the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are
particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of
PPL Energy Supply, and require estimates or other judgments of matters
inherently uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments
included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change
to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting
policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
Statements).  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical
accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with its
Audit Committee.  In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed the
following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting
policies with the Audit Committee.

SFAS

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides a definition of fair value as well as a
framework for measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB
amended SFAS 157, as originally issued, through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1
and FSP FAS 157-2.  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its
scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 was effective upon issuance and
delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis (at least annually).  In October 2008, the FASB
further amended SFAS 157 through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-3, which was
effective upon issuance and amends SFAS 157 to clarify its application in a
market that is not active.

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL Energy Supply partially applied SFAS 157,
prospectively, effective January 1, 2008.  PPL Energy Supply adopted
FSP FAS 157-3, prospectively, effective July 1, 2008.  The partial
application of SFAS 157 primarily affected fair value measurement concepts used
or embedded in PPL Energy Supply's critical accounting policies related to
"Price Risk Management" and "Defined Benefits."  PPL Energy Supply's
election to defer the application of SFAS 157 for eligible assets and
liabilities will primarily affect the fair value component of PPL Energy
Supply's critical accounting policies related to "Asset Impairment" and "Asset
Retirement Obligations" in 2009.  See Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial
Statements for additional information regarding SFAS 157.

Defined
Benefits

PPL
Energy Supply subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans and participate in and are allocated a significant portion
of the liability and net periodic defined benefit costs of plans sponsored by
PPL Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply follow the guidance of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 when accounting for
these defined benefits.  In addition, PPL and PPL Energy Supply
adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 effective
December 31, 2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL
and PPL Energy Supply are required to record an asset or liability to recognize
the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to
OCI.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is
now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL and PPL Energy Supply no
longer recognize additional minimum liability adjustments in OCI.  See
Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the
plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any difference between actual and estimated
results is recorded in OCI.  These amounts in AOCI are amortized to
income over future periods.  This delayed recognition in income of
actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives
of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The primary assumptions
are:

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL Energy
Supply starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 300 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$275 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply increased
the discount rate for its domestic pension plans from 6.39% to 6.50% as a result
of this assessment and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement
benefit plans from 6.13% to 6.37%.

A similar
process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its
base.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply increased the discount
rate for the WPD plans from 6.37% to 7.47% as a result of this
assessment.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL Energy Supply considers tax
implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of
investments held by the plans.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy
Supply's expected return on plan assets was decreased from 8.04% to 7.78% for
its domestic pension plans.  For the WPD plans, PPL Energy Supply's
expected return on plan assets remained at 7.90% at December 31,
2008.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL Energy Supply considers past
experience in light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31,
2008, PPL Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for
its domestic plans.  For the WPD plans, PPL Energy Supply's rate of
compensation increase was decreased from 4.25% to 4.0% at December 31,
2008.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL Energy Supply considers past
performance and forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31,
2008, PPL Energy Supply's health care cost trend rates were 8.40% for 2009,
gradually declining to 5.50% for 2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and OCI.  While the charts below reflect either
an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would
impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net
periodic defined benefit costs and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite
direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the
change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income
tax effects.

plan liabilities:

In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply was allocated and recognized net periodic defined benefit
costs charged to operating expenses of $22 million.  This amount
represents a $40 million decrease from 2007.  This decrease in expense
was primarily attributable to decreased amortization from AOCI of prior losses
for WPD's plans.

Asset
Impairment

PPL
Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets that are
subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, in
accordance with SFAS 144 (indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment
at least annually in accordance with SFAS 142).

For a
long-lived asset to be held and used, PPL Energy Supply tests for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's
carrying value may not be recoverable.  Examples of such events or
changes in circumstances are:

For a
long-lived asset to be held and used, an impairment exists when the carrying
value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the
asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying
value to its estimated fair value.

For a
long-lived asset held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying value of
the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to
sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss
is recorded to adjust the asset (disposal group)'s carrying value to its
estimated fair value less cost to sell.  A gain is recognized for any
subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the
cumulative impairment previously recognized.

In
determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
value of the assets and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those
identified and recorded in the financial statements.  For determining
fair value, the FASB has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets
are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are
unavailable, PPL Energy Supply considers all valuation techniques appropriate in
the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be
obtained.  PPL Energy Supply has generally used discounted cash flow
to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when
available.  Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future
cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the
present value of the cash flow streams.

PPL
Energy Supply considers alternate courses of action to recover the carrying
value of a long-lived asset, and it uses estimated cash flows from the "most
likely" alternative to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the
most likely outcome.  If no alternative is clearly the most likely,
then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated
cash flows from the alternatives.  For assets tested for impairment as
of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test
consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet
date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the
assets.  That assessment is not revised based on events that occur
after the balance sheet date.

In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply recorded an impairment related to the cancellation of a
hydroelectric generation capacity increase project.  See Note 9 to the
Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL
Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS
142.  SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level.  PPL Energy Supply has determined its reporting
units to be at or one level below its operating segments.  PPL Energy
Supply performs an annual impairment test for goodwill, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The
second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of
goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That
is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was
the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied
fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying
value of that goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the implied
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the
reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply was required to complete the second step of the goodwill
impairment test for its U.K. reporting unit.  This assessment did not
result in an impairment charge, as the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded
the carrying value of goodwill.  Management primarily used
undiscounted cash flows, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the
fair value of the U.K. reporting unit's assets and liabilities as well as the
U.K. reporting unit's fair value.  The fair value measurement concepts
of SFAS 157 were applied to determine the fair value of applicable financial
assets and liabilities.  A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of
10%, or an increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points, would not have
resulted in an impairment of goodwill.

PPL
Energy Supply also performs a review of the residual value of certain leased
assets in accordance with SFAS 13.  PPL Energy Supply tests the
residual value of these assets annually.  The residual value is
defined by SFAS 13 as the estimated fair value of the leased property at the end
of the lease term.  If the review produces a lower estimate of
residual value than was originally recorded, PPL Energy Supply is required to
determine whether the decline is other-than-temporary.  If it is
other-than-temporary, the residual value will be revised using the new
estimate.  This reduction in the residual value will be recognized as
a loss in the period in which the estimate was changed.  If the review
provides a higher estimate of residual value than was originally recorded, no
adjustment will be made.

In
testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
assumptions to estimate:  future cash flows; the useful lives of the
leased assets; fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in
significantly different outcomes from those identified and recorded in the
financial statements.  PPL Energy Supply uses discounted cash flow to
determine the estimated fair value of the leased assets at the end of the lease
term.

In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain
leased assets.  This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes
to the residual value.  PPL Energy Supply's estimate was based on
using projections of electric and fuel prices and any firm sale and purchase
agreements.  An increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points or a
10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would have resulted in an
insignificant reduction of the residual value of these leased assets, if it was
determined that the reduction was other-than-temporary.

4)

Leasing

PPL
Energy Supply applies EITF 01-8 to determine whether an arrangement contains a
lease within the scope of SFAS 13.  PPL Energy Supply applies the
provisions of SFAS 13 to all transactions that qualify for lease
accounting.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply applies the provisions of
numerous other accounting pronouncements that provide specific guidance and
additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing
arrangements.  In general, there are two types of leases from a
lessee's perspective:  operating leases (leases accounted for
off-balance sheet); and capital leases (leases capitalized on the balance
sheet).

In
accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or
capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease, thus
significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
statements.

In
addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for
book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  The tolling agreement extends through 2021 and is
considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes that was determined to be
an operating lease.  See Notes 11 and 21 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.  If this transaction were to be accounted
for as a capital lease, PPL Energy Supply would have recorded approximately $269
million of additional assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet at December
31, 2008.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
leases.

5)

Loss
Accruals

PPL
Energy Supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain
outcomes.  PPL Energy Supply's accounting for such events is
prescribed by SFAS 5 and other related accounting guidance.  SFAS 5
defines a contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of
circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise
that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  PPL Energy Supply does not
record the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains, unless recovery
is assured.  PPL Energy Supply continuously assesses potential loss
contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory
penalties and other events.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial
identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering
events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as
to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these
aspects require significant judgment by PPL Energy Supply's
management.

PPL
Energy Supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers
and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has
been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Significant
judgment was required by PPL Energy Supply's management to perform an assessment
of the contingency related to the Montana hydroelectric litigation.

In June
2008, PPL's management assessed the loss exposure related to the Montana
hydroelectric litigation, given the June 2008 decision by the Montana First
Judicial District Court (District Court).  The District Court awarded
compensation of approximately $34 million for the years 2000 through 2006, and
approximately $6 million for 2007 as rent for the use of the State of Montana's
streambeds by PPL Montana's hydroelectric facilities.  The District
Court also deferred the determination of compensation for 2008 and subsequent
years to the Montana State Land Board (Land Board).

In
October 2008, PPL Montana filed an appeal of the decision to the Montana Supreme
Court and a stay of judgment, including a stay of the Land Board's to assess
compensation against PPL Montana for 2008 and future periods.  PPL
Montana timely filed its opening appellate in February 2009.

PPL's
management concluded, based on its assessment and after consultations with its
trial counsel, that it has meritorious arguments on appeal for the years 2000
through 2006.  PPL assessed the likelihood of a loss for these years
as reasonably possible.  However, PPL Montana has not recorded a loss
accrual for these years, as the likelihood of a loss was not deemed
probable.

For 2007
and subsequent years, PPL's management believes that while it also has
meritorious arguments, it is probable that its hydroelectric projects will be
subject to annual estimated compensation ranging from $300,000 to $6
million.  Given that there was no single amount within that range more
likely than any other, PPL Montana is annually accruing $300,000.

PPL will
continue to assess the loss exposure for the Montana hydroelectric litigation in
future periods.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on this contingency.

PPL
Energy Supply has identified certain other events that could give rise to a
loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS
5.  SFAS 5 requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential
losses when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been
incurred.  The FASB defines "reasonably possible" as cases in which
"the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less
than likely."  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure
of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual
under SFAS 5.

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL Energy Supply identifies, where applicable, the
triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The
triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the
actual loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances
      for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after
      prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of
      the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately
      collected.

·

Environmental
      and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is
      resolved and PPL Energy Supply makes actual payments, a better estimate of
      the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered
      probable.

PPL
Energy Supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves
ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel,
engineers, operation management and other parties.

6)

Asset
Retirement Obligations

SFAS 143
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements.  The
initial obligation should be measured at its estimated fair value.  An
equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the
capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the
asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability should be
increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement,
for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.

FIN 47
clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS 143.  FIN 47
specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair
value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to
calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed through consideration
of estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the
anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was
incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different
results than those identified and recorded in the financial
statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect
the carrying value of various AROs and the related assets, are reviewed
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the
latest estimate of the obligations.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply had AROs totaling $389 million recorded on
the Balance Sheet.  Of this amount, $322 million, or 83%, relates to
PPL Energy Supply's nuclear decommissioning ARO.  PPL Energy Supply's
most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement
costs, the discount rates and the inflation rates.  A variance in the
forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or the inflation rates could
have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The
following chart reflects the sensitivities related to PPL Energy Supply's
nuclear decommissioning ARO liability as of December 31, 2008, associated with a
change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition.  There
is no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or
the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of changing the
assumptions.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the
change based solely on a change in that assumption.

Income
Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL Energy Supply's provision for
income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax
assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007.  The adoption of FIN 48 altered the methodology PPL Energy
Supply previously used to account for income tax
uncertainties.  Effective with the adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax
positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in accordance
with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 requires significant management judgment to determine the
amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax
position.  FIN 48 requires PPL Energy Supply to evaluate its tax
positions following a two-step process.  The first step requires an
entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a
particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance)
that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes
that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of
all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step
requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax
position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
criterion.  The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount
of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds
50%.  PPL Energy Supply's management considers a number of factors in
assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a
settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL Energy Supply reassesses its uncertain tax positions by
considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on
management's assessment of new information, PPL Energy Supply may subsequently
recognize a tax benefit for a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize
a previously recognized tax position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously
recognized tax position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution
of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts
accrued and may materially impact PPL Energy Supply's financial statements in
the future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by payment or receipt of cash, within one year of the
reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and
reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate
realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of
factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the
reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized
in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

At
December 31, 2008, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by between $28 million
and $114 million for PPL Energy Supply.  This decrease could result
from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of
uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign taxes, the
timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact on
alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of
certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing
groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct
settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative
guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute
of limitation.

PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES CORPORATION

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
Electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  Its headquarters are in Allentown,
PA.  Please refer to "Item 1. Business - Background" for a description
of PPL Electric's business.  PPL Electric's strategy and principal
challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery business at the most
efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer service and reliability
in a cost-effective manner.

PPL
Electric's electricity delivery business is
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, this business is subject to regulatory
risk with respect to costs that may be recovered and investment returns that may
be collected through customer rates.  In particular, uncertainty
driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009, when its full requirements supply contracts with PPL
EnergyPlus expire, presents a risk for PPL Electric.  The Customer
Choice Act requires electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric, to act as
a PLR of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be
recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC.  As discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements, there are a number of ongoing regulatory and legislative activities
that may affect PPL Electric's recovery of supply costs after
2009.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure
default electricity supply in 2007 through 2009 for retail customers who do not
choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this
plan, PPL Electric has contracted for two-thirds of the 2010 electricity supply
it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial
customers.  In August 2008, the PUC approved a plan proposed by PPL
Electric, under which its residential and small commercial customers, beginning
in 2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price increases
when generation rate caps expire in 2010.  Approximately 10% of PPL
Electric's customers are participating in the plan.

In
February 2009, PPL Electric asked the PUC for permission to offer customers a
second option for reducing the potential initial impact of higher electricity
prices resulting from expiration of the generation rate caps.  If
approved by the PUC, this option would enable eligible residential and eligible
small-business customers to defer payment of any increase greater than 25% in
their 2010 electric bills.  The 25% will be calculated on an average
rate schedule usage basis, and will be based on a comparison of currently
estimated 2009 bills to currently estimated 2010 bills.

In September 2007, the PUC regulations became effective
regarding the obligation of Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default
electricity supply in 2011 and beyond.  In August 2008, PPL Electric
filed for PUC approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan under these
regulations.  In addition to this regulatory activity, in October
2008, the legislature passed and the Pennsylvania Governor signed a bill that,
among other things:  (i) requires electric utilities to meet specified
goals for reduction in use and peak demand; (ii) establishes procedures and
standards for the purchase of PLR supply; and (iii) requires utilities to
install smart metering technology and offer time-of-use
rates.  Utilities must file with the PUC by July 1, 2009, for approval
of plans to meet the conservation and demand side requirements of the
legislation.

The
Governor recently publicly stated that he expects some form of rate mitigation
to be passed by the state legislature.  I

n addition, in the last
legislative session, certain Pennsylvania legislators introduced legislation to
extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in PPL
Electric's case is December 31, 2009.

It is
possible that similar legislation could be reintroduced.  If such
legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could
experience substantial operating losses, cash flow shortfalls and other adverse
financial impacts.

In
addition to the activities discussed above relating to PPL Electric's PLR
obligations, PPL Electric is engaged in three other major regulatory
proceedings.  First, in April 2008, the FERC granted PPL Electric's
request for incentive rate treatment for the Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV
Transmission Line.  Those incentives are:  (i) a 1.25%
increase to the return on equity previously approved for the project, (ii)
inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base, and (iii) recovery of
all costs if the line is abandoned.  In addition, FERC granted PPL
Electric a 0.5% increase to the return on equity previously approved for its
continuing membership in PJM.  Second, in August 2008, PPL Electric
requested permission from FERC to replace its stated rates for transmission
service with a formula rate.  In October 2008, FERC permitted PPL
Electric's proposed formula rate to go into effect, subject to
refund.  The matter is in settlement discussions before an
administrative law judge.  Third, in January 2009, PPL Electric filed
its application with the PUC requesting permission to site and construct the
Susquehanna-Roseland line.  PUC review is expected to take
approximately one year.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL
Electric is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL Electric
continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and
liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning these and other material risks
PPL Electric faces in its business.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Electric's past
and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and managing the
risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

Market
Events

The
continued downturn in the financial markets has increased the complexity of
managing credit risk, responding to liquidity needs, measuring financial
instruments at fair value, and managing market price risk.

Global
bank credit capacity has been reduced dramatically and the cost of renewing or
establishing new credit facilities has increased significantly.  New
bank credit facilities generally are being restricted to less than one-year
terms, thereby introducing uncertainties as to businesses' ability to enter into
long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and
availability of credit.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL Electric would incur a loss as a result of
nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations.

The continued volatility
and downturn in financial and commodity markets during 2008 have generally
increased PPL Electric's exposure to credit risk.  See Notes 16 and 19
to the Financial Statements for additional information about credit
concentration and "Risk Management - Credit Risk" for more information on credit
risk.

Liquidity
Issues

The
continued downturn in financial markets has generally made obtaining new sources
of bank and capital markets funding difficult and costly.  During this
challenging period, PPL Electric expects to continue to have access to adequate
sources of liquidity through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and
its credit facilities.  PPL Electric plans to issue, subject to market
conditions, up to $300 million in long-term debt securities in mid-2009 and does
not expect to need to issue any commercial paper during 2009, but may do so from
time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow needs if commercial paper market
conditions improve.  See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital
Resources" for additional information.

Securities Price
Risk

PPL
Electric participates in and is allocated costs from defined benefit plans
sponsored by PPL.  PPL's defined benefit plans experienced negative
investment returns in 2008, impacting the funded status of the plans as
disclosed in Note 13 to the Financial Statements.  Determination of
the funded status of defined benefit plans, contribution requirements and net
periodic defined benefit costs for future years is subject to changes in several
assumptions, including the performance of the assets in the
plans.  See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined
Benefits" for a discussion of the assumptions and sensitivities regarding those
assumptions.

The
information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL
Electric's Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying
Notes.

Terms and
abbreviations are explained in the glossary.  Dollars are in millions
unless otherwise noted.

In
      2005, PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual, including interest expense,
      related to a PJM billing dispute.  In 2006, the accrual was
      reduced and it was determined that PPL Energy Supply was responsible for a
      portion of the loss accrual, including
interest.

PPL
Electric's earnings beyond 2008 are subject to various risks and
uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1A. Risk
Factors," the rest of this Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact PPL
Electric's future earnings.

Outlook

Excluding
special items and the impact of the cost reduction initiative discussed below,
PPL Electric projects slightly lower earnings in 2009 compared with 2008, where
slightly higher distribution revenues are expected to be offset by higher
operation and maintenance expenses.

See Note
26 to the Financial Statements for additional information on a cost reduction
initiative completed in February 2009.  PPL Electric expects to
achieve annual pre-tax savings of between $6 and $8 million from the reduction
of management and staff positions, including a reduction of costs allocated as a
result of the elimination of positions at PPL
Services.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the PUC-approved plan to
procure default electricity supply in 2007 through 2009, additional information
on Pennsylvania legislative and other regulatory activities, and a FERC-approved
transmission rate, all of which may impact future results of
operations.

PLR

$


$


Delivery



Other


$


$


The
increase in PLR revenue for 2008 compared with 2007 was attributable to normal
load growth.  The increase in delivery revenue for the same period was
primarily attributable to a base rate increase effective January 1, 2008, and
normal load growth.  These increases were partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of weather on residential and commercial sales in
2008.

The
increase in PLR revenue and delivery revenue for 2007 compared with 2006 was
primarily due to a 4% increase in sales volume.  This increase was
primarily due to the impact of favorable weather in 2007 on residential and
commercial sales and normal load growth.

Wholesale Electric to
Affiliate

PPL
Electric has a contract to sell to PPL EnergyPlus the electricity that PPL
Electric purchases under contracts with NUGs.  The decrease of $48
million in wholesale electric to affiliate in 2008 compared to 2007 was
primarily due to the expiration of a NUG contract at the end of 2007 and the
expiration of two NUG contracts during 2008.  The decrease was
partially offset by higher prices on certain NUG
contracts.  Substantially all of the remaining NUG contracts will
expire by 2010.

Energy
Purchases

Energy
purchases decreased by $43 million for 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to
the expiration of a NUG contract at the end of 2007 and two NUG contracts in
2008, partially offset by higher prices on certain NUG
contracts.  Substantially all of the remaining NUG contracts will
expire by 2010.

In 2005,
PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual related to a PJM billing
dispute.  In 2006, the accrual was reduced and it was determined that
PPL Energy Supply was responsible for a portion of the loss
accrual.  The $28 million reduction of this loss accrual in 2006 was
the primary reason for the $31 million increase in energy purchases for 2007
compared with 2006.  Also, $6 million in higher ancillary costs
contributed to the increase.

Energy
Purchases from Affiliate

Energy
purchases from affiliate increased by $16 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  The increase was primarily due to higher prices for energy
purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus that support the
PLR load, as well as higher PLR load.

Energy
purchases from affiliate increased by $102 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  The increase was primarily due to higher PLR load, as well as
higher prices for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL
EnergyPlus that support the PLR load.

(a)

The
      decrease in bad debt expense from 2007 to 2008 reflects the impact of a
      new Universal Service Rider effective January 1, 2008, which provides for
      recovery of costs associated with universal service programs including
      uncollectible accounts applicable to certain residential
      customers.

Amortization
of Recoverable Transition Costs

Amortization
of recoverable transition costs decreased by $17 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  Amortization of recoverable transition costs increased by $28
million in 2007 compared with 2006.  The amortization of recoverable
transition costs is based on a PUC amortization schedule, adjusted for ITC and
CTC recoveries in customer rates and related expenses.  Since the
amortization substantially matches the revenue recorded based on recovery in
customer rates, there is minimal impact on earnings.

Depreciation

Depreciation
increased by $14 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to PP&E
additions.  The increase reflects the impact of the 2006 purchase of
equipment previously leased.  See Note 11 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.

Taxes,
Other Than Income

Taxes,
other than income increased by $3 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  The increase was primarily due to a $6 million increase in
Pennsylvania gross receipts tax expense which reflects an increase in the tax
rate in 2008.  This tax is passed through to customers.  The
increase was partially offset by a $1 million decrease in domestic sales and use
tax.

Taxes,
other than income increased by $11 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  The increase was primarily due to a $12 million increase in
Pennsylvania gross receipts tax expense, which is passed through to customers,
resulting from a 4% increase in sales volume.

See Note
17 to the Financial Statements for details of other income.

Interest
Income from Affiliate

Interest
income from affiliate decreased by $10 million in 2008 compared with
2007.  The decrease was the result of a reduced average balance
outstanding on a note receivable from an affiliate and a lower average rate on
this note due to the floating interest rate.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

In
general, the continued downturn in the financial markets has made obtaining new
sources of bank and capital markets funding difficult and
costly.  During this challenging period, PPL Electric continues to
focus on maintaining a strong credit profile and liquidity
position.  PPL Electric expects to continue to have adequate liquidity
available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and its credit
facilities.

PPL
Electric currently does not expect to need to access commercial paper markets or
debt and equity capital markets until mid-2009.

PPL
Electric's cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and
capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not
limited to:

At
December 31, PPL Electric had the following:

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased by 14%, or $80 million, in 2008
compared with 2007, primarily as a result of increased revenues, which was due
primarily to a base rate increase effective January 1, 2008 and normal load
growth, as well as less interest incurred on long-term debt, as a result of the
repayment of transition bonds during 2007 and 2008.  The increases to
cash provided by operating activities resulting from these items were partially
offset by increased energy purchases, primarily as a result of higher prices for
energy purchased from PPL EnergyPlus under the PLR contracts and higher PLR
load, as well as an insurance recovery of storm costs in 2007.

While PPL
Electric's net cash provided by operating activities was relatively

unchanged
from 2006 to 2007,

there were some significant changes in the components
of its net cash provided by operating activities.  In 2007, delivery
revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes in 2007
compared with 2006, which was due to the impact of favorable weather in 2007 on
residential and commercial sales and normal load growth.  This
increase in revenues was offset by an increase in energy purchases, primarily
from PPL EnergyPlus under the PLR contracts to support the PLR
load.

An
important element supporting the stability of PPL Electric's cash from
operations is its purchase contracts with PPL EnergyPlus.  These
contracts provide sufficient energy for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge its
customers over this period.  These contracts require cash collateral
or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the
entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of adverse changes in
market prices.  Also under the contracts, PPL Energy Supply may
request cash collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions or
terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the
event of a downgrade of PPL Electric's credit ratings.  The maximum
amount that PPL Electric would have to post under these contracts is $300
million, and PPL Electric estimates that it would not have had to post any
collateral if energy prices decreased by 10% from year-end 2008 or 2007
levels.

As
discussed in the "Overview," pursuant to a plan approved by the PUC, PPL
Electric has entered into contracts to procure two-thirds of the 2010
electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers.  Absent any legislation being passed to
extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, PPL Electric
would expect its cash from operations to remain relatively stable in
2010.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2008 and projected expenditures for the years 2009
through 2013.

Net cash
used in investing activities remained relatively stable in 2008 compared with
2007, but there were significant changes in certain components.  In
2008, there was a net decrease of $69 million in restricted cash and cash
equivalents compared to a net increase of $8 million in 2007.  Capital
expenditures decreased $18 million in 2008 compared with 2007.  In
2008, PPL Electric loaned $23 million to an affiliate compared with receiving
$23 million in 2007 from an affiliate as partial repayment of a demand
loan.  Additionally, PPL Electric received net proceeds of $25 million
from purchases and sales of investments in 2007 compared with none in
2008.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased by $48 million in 2007 compared with
2006, primarily as a result of $25 million in net proceeds from purchases and
sales of investments and $23 million received from an affiliate as a partial
repayment on a demand loan that was extended to the affiliate in
2004.

Financing
Activities

Net cash
provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2008 compared with net
cash used in financing activities of $446 million in 2007.  The change
from 2007 to 2008 primarily reflects increased issuances and less retirements of
long-term debt, less common stock dividends to PPL and increased short-term
borrowings in 2008.  PPL Electric had net debt issuances of $148
million in 2008 compared to net debt retirements of $306 million in 2007, and it
paid $21 million less of common stock dividends to PPL in 2008 compared to
2007.

Although
net cash used in financing activities remained stable in 2007 compared with
2006, there were significant changes in certain components.  PPL
Electric had net debt retirements of $306 million in 2007 compared with $433
million in 2006.  Additionally, in 2006, PPL Electric received net
proceeds of $245 million from the issuance of preference stock, received a $75
million contribution from PPL and repurchased $200 million of common stock from
PPL.  A portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the
preference stock was used to fund the repurchase of common stock from PPL in
2006.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for information
regarding the preference stock issued by PPL Electric.

See
"Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans to issue
debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity
available to PPL Electric.  Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a
discussion of PPL Electric's plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred
securities, as well as maturities of PPL Electric's long-term debt.

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
Electric expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in
the near term, including various credit facilities and a commercial paper
program.  PPL Electric currently does not expect to need to access
commercial paper markets or debt and equity capital markets until mid-2009, but
may decide to access capital markets at an earlier date, subject to market
conditions.

Credit
Facilities

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Electric's total committed borrowing capacity under its
credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
addition to the financial covenant noted in the table above, the credit
agreements governing the credit facilities contain various other
covenants.  Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable
grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or
termination of the agreements.  PPL Electric monitors compliance with
the covenants on a regular basis.  At December 31, 2008, PPL
Electric was in material compliance with these covenants.  At this
time, PPL Electric believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions
will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note
8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of PPL Electric's credit
facilities.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and
when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL Electric's
five-year syndicated credit facility based on available capacity.  PPL
Electric had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31,
2008.

As noted
below under "Credit Ratings," commercial paper for PPL Electric is rated P-2,
A-2 and F2 by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.  Liquidity in the markets
for commercial paper with these ratings became extremely limited during the
second half of 2008 as a result of the downturn in the financial
markets.  Liquidity for commercial paper with these ratings has
improved thus far in 2009, but it is still somewhat difficult and costly for PPL
Electric to issue commercial paper.  Based on its current cash
position and anticipated cash flows, PPL Electric currently does not expect to
need to issue any commercial paper during 2009, but it may do so from time to
time to facilitate short-term cash flow needs if market conditions
improve.

Contributions
from PPL

From time
to time PPL may make capital contributions to PPL Electric.  PPL
Electric may use these contributions for general corporate
purposes.

Long-Term
Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
to market conditions in 2009, PPL Electric plans to issue up to $300 million in
long-term debt securities in mid-2009.  PPL Electric prefunded a
portion of its 2009 financing needs through the issuance of $400 million of
Senior Secured Bonds in October 2008, which will partially fund an approximately
$486 million bond maturity in August 2009.  See Note 8 to the
Financial Statements for further discussion of the prefunding of PPL Electric's
2009 debt maturity.  PPL expects to use the proceeds from the issuance
of long-term debt securities primarily to fund capital expenditures, to
partially fund the August 2009 debt maturity and for general corporate
purposes.

PPL
Electric currently does not plan to issue any equity securities in
2009.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, and taxes, PPL Electric currently expects to incur
future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations
and payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities.

PPL
Electric's capital expenditure projections for the years 2009 through 2013 total
approximately $2.6 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised
periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  In light of current economic conditions, which have
contributed to slower system-wide load growth and deferral of customer growth
expansion plans, certain projects previously included in this table have been
cancelled or completion dates have been delayed.  The table includes
projected costs for the PJM-approved regional transmission line expansion
project.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

PPL
Electric plans to fund its capital expenditures in 2009 with cash on hand, cash
from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities.

Contractual

PPL
Electric has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the
ordinary course of conducting its business.  At December 31, 2008, the

Dividends

From time
to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Electric pays dividends on
its common stock to its parent, PPL.

As
discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric may not pay
dividends on its common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full
dividends have been paid on the 6.25% Series Preference Stock for the
then-current dividend period.  Additionally, PPL Electric's 2001
Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments on its common stock in
the event that PPL Electric fails to meet an interest coverage ratio or fails to
comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other
subsidiaries.  PPL Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of
such limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare
dividends.

PPL
Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
preferred securities of PPL Electric.  Based on their respective
independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or
ratings affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it
issues.  The credit ratings of PPL Electric are based on information
provided by PPL Electric and other sources.  The ratings of Moody's,
S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities
of PPL Electric.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or
withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of
each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the
securities.  A downgrade in PPL Electric's credit ratings could result
in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets.

following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL Electric at
December 31, 2008.

      ratings.

Moody's
and S&P did not take any actions related to PPL Electric during
2008.  In March 2008, Fitch completed a review of its credit ratings
for PPL Electric and affirmed all the ratings for PPL Electric, with the
exception that it lowered the preferred stock rating to BBB from
BBB+.  Fitch stated in the related press release that the lower
preferred stock rating reflects its junior position in the capital structure and
does not reflect any change in credit quality.

In
January 2009, S&P completed a review of PPL Electric, upon which it revised
its outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the A- issuer rating of PPL
Electric.  S&P stated in its press release that the revision in
its outlook reflects the linkage with PPL, whose outlook was also revised to
negative from stable, along with their expectation that PPL Electric's financial
metrics could weaken beginning in 2010.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

PPL
Electric has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope
of FIN 45.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
of guarantees.

Risk
Management

Market
Risk

Commodity
Price Risk - PLR Contracts through 2009

PPL
Electric and PPL EnergyPlus have power supply agreements under which PPL
EnergyPlus sells to PPL Electric (under a predetermined pricing arrangement)
energy and capacity to fulfill PPL Electric's PLR obligation through
2009.  As a result, PPL Electric has shifted any electric price risk
relating to its PLR obligation to PPL EnergyPlus through 2009.  See
Note 16 to the Financial Statements for information regarding credit risk
associated with the PLR contracts with PPL EnergyPlus.

Commodity
Price Risk - PLR Contracts Subsequent to 2009

In order
to mitigate the risk that PPL Electric will not be able to obtain adequate
energy supply subsequent to 2009, when the full requirements of energy supply
agreements with PPL EnergyPlus expire, PPL Electric has entered into power
purchase agreements that include fixed prices.  PPL Electric's future
financial performance will be affected by its ability to enter into other new
supply contracts, the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to
prevailing market conditions, the regulatory treatment for such contracts and
the associated recovery of its supply costs.  Depending on these
factors, PPL Electric's financial results may be materially adversely
affected.  See "Overview" for information on the PUC-approved
procurement plan and other ongoing Pennsylvania regulatory and legislative
activities.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL
Electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which exposes it to interest
rate risk.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, PPL Electric's potential
annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in
interest rates, was not significant.  PPL Electric estimated that a
10% decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2008 would increase the fair
value of its debt portfolio by $50 million, compared with $49 million at
December 31, 2007.

Defined
Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional
information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan
assets.

Credit R

isk

Credit
risk is the risk that PPL Electric would incur a loss as a result of
nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations.  PPL Electric requires that counterparties maintain
specified credit ratings and requires other assurances in the form of credit
support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty
credit risk.  However, PPL Electric has concentrations of suppliers,
financial institutions and customers.  These concentrations may
impact PPL Electric's overall exposure to credit risk, positively or
negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic,
regulatory or other conditions.

In 2007,
the PUC approved PPL Electric's post-rate cap plan to procure default
electricity supply for retail customers who do not choose an alternative
competitive supplier in 2010.  PPL Electric's plan provides for the
procurement of the necessary electricity supply for 2010 through a series of six
competitive bid solicitation processes during 2007 through 2009.  As
of December 31, 2008, PPL Electric has contracted for two-thirds of the expected
2010 electricity supply requirements for its residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers.  Under the standard Supply Master
Agreement (the Agreement) for the bid solicitation process, PPL Electric
requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an
established credit limit.  In the event a supplier defaults on its
obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the
market.  All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be
recoverable from customers in future rates.  At December 31, 2008, all
of the successful bidders had an investment grade credit rating from S&P,
and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement.  There
is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post
collateral to its suppliers.

See
"Overview" above and Notes 15, 16 and 19 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on the competitive solicitations, the Agreement and
credit concentration.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL
Electric's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the
methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are
particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of
PPL Electric, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these
accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information
presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also
discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements).  PPL's senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and
assumptions regarding them with its Audit Committee.  In addition, PPL's
senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the
application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee.

SFAS

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides a definition of fair value as well as a
framework for measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB
amended SFAS 157, as originally issued, through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1
and FSP FAS 157-2.  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its
scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 was effective upon issuance and
delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually).  In October 2008, the FASB further amended
SFAS 157 through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-3, which was effective upon
issuance and amends SFAS 157 to clarify its application in a market that is not
active.

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL Electric partially applied SFAS 157,
prospectively, effective January 1, 2008.  PPL Electric adopted FSP
FAS 157-3, prospectively, effective July 1, 2008.  The partial
application of SFAS 157 affected fair value measurement concepts used or
embedded in PPL Electric's critical accounting policy related to "Defined
Benefits."  See Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial Statements for
additional information regarding SFAS 157.

Defined
Benefits

PPL
Electric participates in and is allocated a significant portion of the liability
and net periodic defined benefit pension and other postretirement costs of plans
sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL
follows the guidance of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 when accounting for these defined
benefits.  In addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement
date provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31,
2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL is required to
record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined
benefit plans with an offsetting entry to regulatory assets for the portion
allocated to PPL Electric.  Consequently, the funded status of all
defined benefit plans is now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL no
longer recognizes additional minimum liability adjustments in
OCI.  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional
information about the plans and the accounting for defined
benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated
results are recorded as regulatory assets.  The regulatory assets are
amortized to income over future periods.  This delayed recognition in
income of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the
working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The
primary assumptions are:

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL starts
with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 300 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$275 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2008, PPL increased the discount rate for
its domestic pension plans from 6.39% to 6.50% as a result of this assessment
and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from
6.26% to 6.45%.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the
plans.  At December 31, 2008, PPL's expected return on plan assets was
reduced from 8.25% to 8.0% for its domestic pension plans and decreased from
7.80% to 7.0% for its other postretirement benefit plans.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2008, PPL's
rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic
plans.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2008, PPL's
health care cost trend rates were 8.40% for 2009, gradually declining to 5.50%
for 2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and the regulatory assets allocated to PPL
Electric.  The following chart reflects the sensitivities in the 2008
financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions based on
PPL's primary defined benefit plans.  While the charts below reflect
either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change
would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual
net periodic defined benefit costs and regulatory assets by a similar amount in
the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation
of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include
income tax effects.

2)

Loss
Accruals

PPL
Electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain
outcomes.  PPL Electric's accounting for such events is prescribed by
SFAS 5 and other related accounting guidance.  SFAS 5 defines a
contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances
involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will
ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  PPL Electric does not record
the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains, unless recovery is
assured.  PPL Electric continuously assesses potential loss
contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory
penalties and other events.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial
identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering
events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as
to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All three of these
aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by PPL
Electric's management.

PPL
Electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and
engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been
incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

No
significant loss accruals were initially recorded in 2008.

PPL
Electric has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but
that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5.  SFAS 5
requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is
"reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  The FASB defines
"reasonably possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or
events occurring is more than remote but less than likely."  See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss
contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS
5.

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL Electric identifies, where applicable, the
triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The
triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the
actual loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

·

Allowances
      for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after
      prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of
      the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately
      collected.

·

Environmental
      and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is
      resolved and PPL Electric makes actual payments, a better estimate of the
      loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered
      probable.

PPL
Electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  This involves
ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel,
engineers, operation management and other parties.

3)

Income
Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL Electric's provision for
income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax
assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

PPL
Electric and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007.  The adoption of FIN 48 altered the methodology PPL Electric
previously used to account for income tax uncertainties.  Effective
with the adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to
be contingencies assessed in accordance with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 requires significant management judgment to determine the
amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax
position.  FIN 48 requires PPL Electric to evaluate its tax positions
following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to
determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax
position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax
position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the
relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the
relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires
an entity to recognize the benefit of a tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition criterion in the financial
statements.  The benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit
that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds
50%.  PPL Electric's management considers a number of factors in
assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a
settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL Electric reassesses its uncertain tax positions by
considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on
management's assessment of new information, PPL Electric may subsequently
recognize a tax benefit for a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize
a previously recognized tax position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously
recognized tax position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution
of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts
accrued and may materially impact PPL Electric's financial statements in the
future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by payment or receipt of cash, within one year of the
reporting date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and
reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate
realization of a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of
factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the
reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized
in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

At
December 31, 2008, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $9 million for
PPL Electric.  This decrease could result from the timing and/or
valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing
groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct
settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative
guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute
of limitation.

4)

Regulation

PPL
Electric's electricity delivery business is cost-based
rate-regulated.  As a result, PPL Electric accounts for this business
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which requires cost-based
rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects of regulatory actions in their
financial statements.  PPL Electric records assets and liabilities
that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under
GAAP for non-regulated entities.  Regulatory assets generally
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable
of future recovery in regulated customer rates.  Regulatory
liabilities generally represent obligations to regulated customers for previous
collections of costs that have not yet been incurred but are expected to be
incurred in the future.  These amounts are recorded to income only
when the associated costs are incurred.

Management
continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future
recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and
political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates,
recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or
potential deregulation legislation.  Based on this continual
assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of
recovery.  This assessment reflects the current political and
regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in
the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, then
asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating
income.  Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility
in the manner and timing of the depreciation of PP&E and amortization of
regulatory assets.

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, PPL Electric had regulatory assets of $737 million
and $837 million.  All of PPL Electric's regulatory assets are either
currently being recovered under specific rate orders or represent amounts that
will be recovered in future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.

the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' common equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2008.  Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8.  These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of PPL Corporation and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
Board of Directors and Shareowners of PPL Corporation

We have
audited PPL Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). PPL Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting at
Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, PPL Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the
COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets and statements
of long-term debt of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008

equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 27,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve
retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania
and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a
PLR.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
consolidated financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in
which the company has a controlling financial interest.  See Note 24
for additional information regarding variable interest
entities.  Investments in entities in which the company has the
ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling
financial interest are accounted for under the equity method.  See
Note 3 for additional information regarding investments in unconsolidated
affiliates.  All other investments are carried at cost or fair
value.  All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.  Any minority interests are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements.

Regulation

(PPL and PPL
Electric)

PPL
Electric and PPL Gas Utilities, prior to its sale, accounted for regulated
operations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which requires
cost-based rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects of regulatory actions
in their financial statements.

The
regulatory assets below are either included in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent
Assets" or "Assets held for sale" on the Balance Sheets at December
31.

(a)

A

  rates.

The
recoverable transition costs are the result of the PUC Final Order, which
allowed PPL Electric to begin amortizing its competitive transition (or
stranded) costs of $2.97 billion, over an 11-year transition period effective
January 1, 1999.  In August 1999, competitive transition costs of
$2.4 billion were converted to intangible transition costs when they were
securitized by the issuance of transition bonds.  The intangible
transition costs were amortized over the life of the transition bonds, through
December 2008, in accordance with an amortization schedule filed with the
PUC.  The assets of PPL Transition Bond Company, including the
intangible transition property, are not available to creditors of PPL or PPL
Electric.  The remaining competitive transition costs are also being
amortized based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the PUC,
adjusted for those competitive transition costs that were converted to
intangible transition costs.  Amortization of all of the remaining
competitive transition costs of $281 million will occur by the end of
2010.

Taxes
recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes
that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.  Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the
offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized.  In accordance with
SFAS 109, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset
for general-purpose financial reporting; rather, each is displayed
separately.  Because this regulatory asset does not represent cash tax
expenditures already incurred by PPL, this regulatory asset is not earning a
current return.  This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered
over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the
actual cash taxes are incurred.

Recoverable
costs of defined benefit plans represent the portion of unrecognized transition
obligation, prior service cost, and net actuarial loss (gain) that will be
recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.  These regulatory assets are adjusted annually or more
frequently if certain significant events occur, when the funded status of PPL's
defined benefit plans is remeasured, in accordance with the accounting
requirements for defined benefit plans as described in the "Defined Benefits"
section of this note.  These regulatory assets do not represent cash
expenditures already incurred; consequently, these assets are not earning a
current return.

Of these
costs, $13 million for PPL and PPL Electric are expected to be amortized into
net periodic defined benefit costs in 2009.  All costs will be
amortized over the average service lives of plan participants.

In
January 2005, severe ice storms hit PPL Electric's service
territory.  The total costs of restoring service, excluding
capitalized costs and regular payroll expenses, were $16 million.  In
August 2005, the PUC issued an order granting PPL Electric's petition for
authority to defer and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes
a portion of these storm costs subject to certain conditions.  As a
result of the PUC Order and in accordance with SFAS 71, PPL Electric deferred
$12 million of its previously expensed storm costs.  Recovery of these
assets was addressed in PPL Electric's distribution base rate case filed with
the PUC in March 2007.  In December 2007, the PUC approved the
recovery of these assets.  Monthly amortization began in January 2008
and will continue through August 2015.

The
remainder of the regulatory assets included in "Other" will be recovered through
2013.

In August
2006, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania overturned the PUC's decision of
December 2004 that previously allowed PPL Electric to recover, over a 10-year
period, restoration costs incurred in connection with Hurricane Isabel in
September 2003.  As a result of the PUC's 2004 decision and in
accordance with SFAS 71, PPL Electric had established a regulatory asset for the
restoration costs.  Effective January 1, 2005, PPL Electric began
billing these costs to customers and amortizing the regulatory
asset.  The Commonwealth Court denied recovery of these costs because
they were incurred when PPL Electric was subject to capped rates for
transmission and distribution services, through December 31, 2004.  As
a result of the Court's decision in 2006, PPL Electric recorded a charge of $11
million ($7 million after tax) in "Other operation and maintenance" on the
Statements of Income, reversed the remaining unamortized regulatory asset of $9
million and recorded a regulatory liability of $2 million for restoration costs
previously billed to customers from January 2005 through December
2006.  In August 2007, PPL Electric began refunding these costs on
customers' bills, which will continue through December 2009.

Accounting
Records

(PPL and PPL
Electric)

The
system of accounts for PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities, prior to its sale, is
maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the
FERC and adopted by the PUC.

Use
of Estimates

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Loss
Accruals

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Loss
accruals are recorded in accordance with SFAS 5 and other related accounting
guidance.  Potential losses are accrued when (1) information is
available that indicates it is "probable" that a loss has been incurred, given
the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in
which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  PPL
continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental
remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other
events.  PPL discounts its loss accruals for environmental remediation
when appropriate.

PPL also
has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
events have occurred.  For example, estimated losses were accrued when
long-term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements
and when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.

PPL does
not record the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains, unless
recovery is assured.

Changes
in Classification

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

The
classification of certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006 financial statements have
been changed to conform to the current presentation.  The changes in
classification did not affect net income or total equity.

The
classification on the Statements of Cash Flows has not been changed for the
classification of amounts to Discontinued Operations.

Comprehensive
Income

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

Comprehensive
income, which consists of net income and OCI, is defined as changes in equity
from transactions not related to shareowners.  Comprehensive income is
shown on PPL's Statements of Shareowners' Common Equity and Comprehensive Income
and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Member's Equity and Comprehensive
Income.

AOCI,
which is presented on the Balance Sheets of PPL and included in Member's Equity
on the Balance Sheets of PPL Energy Supply, consisted of these after-tax amounts
at December 31.

Risk Management

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the
variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units and
marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply enter into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge their
exposure to changes in the fair value of their debt instruments and to hedge
their exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing
debt instruments or forecasted issuances of debt.  PPL and PPL Energy
Supply also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign
currency exposures related to firm commitments, recognized assets or
liabilities, forecasted transactions, net investments and foreign earnings
translation.

Contracts
that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS
133.  Certain energy contracts have been excluded from the
requirements of SFAS 133 because they meet the definition of a "normal purchase
or normal sale."  These contracts are accounted for using the accrual
method of accounting.  All derivative contracts that are subject to
the accounting requirements of SFAS 133 are reflected on the balance sheet at
their fair value.  These contracts are recorded as "Price risk
management assets" and "Price risk management liabilities" on the Balance
Sheets.  Short-term derivative positions are included in "Current
Assets" and "Current Liabilities."  PPL records long-term derivative
positions in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and
Other Noncurrent Liabilities" and PPL Energy Supply records long-term derivative
positions in "Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other
Noncurrent Liabilities."  On the date the derivative contract is
executed, PPL may designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value
hedge"), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows
to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow
hedge"), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign currency
hedge") or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net investment
hedge").  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in
either OCI or in current-period earnings in accordance with SFAS
133.  Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are
included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities in the
Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the underlying nature of the hedged
items.

When
recognized on the Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from energy
contracts accounted for as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges are reflected
in "Wholesale energy marketing," "Fuel," or "Energy purchases," consistent with
the hedged item.  Unrealized gains and losses from changes in market
prices of energy contracts accounted for as fair value hedges are reflected in
"Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income, as are changes in the underlying
position.  Additionally, PPL enters into certain economic non-trading
energy or energy-related contracts to hedge future cash flows or fair values
that are not eligible for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, or hedge accounting
is not elected.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on these
transactions are reflected in "Wholesale energy marketing," "Unregulated retail
electric and gas," "Fuel" or "Energy purchases" consistent with the hedged
item.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on options to hedge
synthetic fuel tax credits are reflected in "Energy-related businesses"
revenues.

PPL
Energy Supply accounts for non-trading bilateral sales and purchases in
accordance with EITF 03-11.  As such, PPL Energy Supply nets
non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points with
purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points.  A
major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing
available.

Gains and
losses from interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts that hedge
interest payments, when recognized on the Statements of Income, are accounted
for in "Interest Expense."  Gains and losses from foreign currency
derivative contracts that economically hedge foreign earnings translation are
recognized in "Other Income - net."  Gains and losses from foreign
currency derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency payments for
equipment, when recognized on the Statements of Income, are accounted for in
"Depreciation."

See Note
19 for additional information on SFAS 133 and related accounting
guidance.

Master
Netting Arrangements

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

As
permitted by FIN 39, PPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net
derivative positions in the financial statements.  Accordingly, PPL
and its subsidiaries do not offset such derivative positions against the fair
value of amounts (or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the
right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash
collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.

PPL's and
PPL Energy Supply's obligation to return counterparty cash collateral under
master netting arrangements was $94 million and $21 million at December 31,
2008 and 2007.

PPL
Electric's obligation to return cash collateral to PPL Energy Supply under
master netting arrangements was $300 million at December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007.  See Note 16 for additional
information.

PPL and
PPL Electric have not posted any cash collateral under master netting
arrangements.

Revenue

Utility
Revenue

(PPL)

The

U.K. rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

The
Statements of Income "Utility" line item contains revenues from the U.K.
rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
Electric)

Since
most of PPL Electric's operations are regulated, it is not meaningful to use a
"Utility" caption.  Therefore, the revenues of PPL Electric are
presented according to specific types of revenue.

Revenue
Recognition

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Operating
revenues, except for "Energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy
deliveries through the end of the calendar month.  Unbilled retail
revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered
throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the
month.  Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an
estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per
kWh.  Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to
reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are confirmed and
invoiced.  At that time, unbilled revenue is reversed and actual
revenue is recorded.

PPL
Energy Supply records energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is
delivered.  The wholesale sales and purchases that meet the criteria
in EITF 03-11 are reported net on the Statements of Income within "Wholesale
energy marketing."  Additionally, the bilateral sales and purchases
that are designated as trading activities are also reported net, in accordance
with EITF 02-3 and are reported on the Statements of Income within "Net energy
trading margins."  Spot market activity that balances PPL Energy
Supply's physical trading positions is included on the Statements of Income in
"Net energy trading margins."

Certain
PPL subsidiaries participate in RTOs, primarily in PJM, but also in the
surrounding regions of New York (NYISO), New England (ISO-NE) and the Midwest
(MISO).  In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity
to its customers who have selected it as a supplier and a seller for PPL's
generation subsidiaries.  PPL Electric is a transmission owner and PLR
in PJM.  In ISO-NE, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving
entity, and a seller for PPL's New England generating assets.  In the
NYISO and MISO regions, PPL EnergyPlus acts as a marketer.  PPL
Electric does not participate in ISO-NE, NYISO or MISO.  A function of
interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements (generation
plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their MWh obligations (load plus
scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day.  If the net
result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with
a spot-market sale to the ISO at the respective market price for that hour; if
the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market
purchase from the ISO at the respective market price for that
hour.  ISO purchases and sales are not allocated to individual
customers.  PPL records the hourly net sales and purchases in its
financial statements as sales to and purchases from the respective
ISOs.

"Energy-related
businesses" revenue includes revenues from the mechanical contracting and
engineering subsidiaries, as well as, WPD's telecommunications and property
subsidiaries.  The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries
record revenues from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a
percentage of the estimated total cost for each
contract.  Accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of
billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset on the Balance
Sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
contracts are recorded as a current liability on the Balance
Sheets.  The amount of costs in excess of billings was $10 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the amount of billings in excess of costs
was $80 million and $76 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

During
2007, PPL recognized $55 million of revenue related to a settlement agreement
for cost-based payments based upon the RMR status of units at its Wallingford,
Connecticut generating facility.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Accounts
receivable are reported in the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount
adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Accounts
receivable collectibility is evaluated using a combination of factors, including
past due status based on contractual terms.  Reserve balances are
analyzed to assess the reasonableness of the balances in comparison to the
actual accounts receivable balances and write-offs.  Adjustments are
made to reserve balances based on the results of analysis, the aging of
receivables, and historical and industry trends.

Additional
specific reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, such as bankruptcies,
are recorded on a case-by-case basis after having been researched and reviewed
by management.  The nature of the item, trends in write-offs, the age
of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions are
considered as a basis for determining the adequacy of the reserve for
uncollectible account balances.

Accounts
receivable are charged-off in the period in which the receivable is deemed
uncollectible.  Recoveries of accounts receivable previously
charged-off are recorded when it is known they will be received.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2008, the California ISO reserves accounted for 47% and 81% of the
total allowance for doubtful accounts of PPL and PPL Energy Supply and 44% and
85% of those accounts at December 31, 2007.  See Note 15 for
additional information.

Cash

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply
and PPL Electric)

Cash
Equivalents

All
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Bank
deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that
have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted
cash and cash equivalents.  The change in restricted cash and cash
equivalents is reported as an investing activity in the Statements of Cash
Flows.  On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash
and cash equivalents is shown as "Restricted cash and cash equivalents" within
current assets, while the noncurrent portion is included in "Other" within other
noncurrent assets.  See Note 20 for the components of restricted cash
and cash equivalents.

Investments

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply
and PPL Electric)

Generally,
the original maturity date of an investment and management's ability to sell an
investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of
investments as either short-term or long-term.  Investments that would
otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or
use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure
in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation
of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.

Short-term
Investments

Short-term
investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are
considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest
rates.  Short-term investments have original maturities greater than
three months and are included in "Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheets
of PPL and PPL Energy Supply and in "Current Assets-Other" on the Balance Sheets
of PPL Electric.

Investments in Debt and
Marketable Equity Securities

Investments
in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, and measured at amortized
cost, when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity.  Debt securities and marketable equity securities that are
acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near-term
are classified as trading.  Trading securities are generally held to
capitalize on fluctuations in their value.  All other investments in
debt and marketable equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale.  Both trading and available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value.  Any unrealized gains and losses for
trading securities are included in earnings.  Unrealized gains and
losses for available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in OCI or are
recognized currently in earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to
be other-than-temporary.  The specific identification method is used
to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and marketable equity
securities.  See Note 23 for additional information on
available-for-sale securities.

Long-Lived
and Intangible Assets

Property, Plant and
Equipment

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PP&E
is recorded at original cost, unless impaired.  If impaired, the asset
is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the asset's new cost
basis.  Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs,
certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable.  The cost of
repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as
incurred.  PPL records costs associated with planned major maintenance
projects in the period in which the costs are incurred.  No costs are
accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed.

Depreciation

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Depreciation
is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods
including the straight-line, composite and group methods.  When a
component of PP&E is retired that was depreciated under the composite or
group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated
depreciation.  When all or a significant portion of an operating unit
that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the
property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any
gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by
regulators.

PPL and
its subsidiaries periodically review the useful lives of their fixed
assets.  During 2007, as a result of communication from Ofgem relating
specifically to prepayment meters, WPD reduced the remaining useful lives of
existing meters from nine years to 18 months.  The effect for 2007 was
to decrease income from continuing operations and net income, as a result of
higher depreciation, by $3 million (or $0.01 per share, basic and diluted, for
PPL).

In 2007,
WPD reviewed the useful lives of its distribution network
assets.  Effective April 1, 2007, after considering information
from Ofgem and other internal and external surveys, the weighted average useful
lives were extended to 54 years from 40 years.  The effect of this
change in useful lives for 2007 was to increase income from continuing
operations and net income, as a result of lower depreciation, by $13 million (or
$0.03 per share, basic and diluted, for PPL).

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a
business.  If several businesses are acquired in a single transaction,
the purchase price must be apportioned to each business based on the fair value
of each business.  Each business is then assigned to the appropriate
reporting unit and the related goodwill is calculated for each business and
included in that reporting unit.  PPL's reporting units are
significant businesses that have discrete financial information and the
operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management.  In
accordance with SFAS 142, PPL and its subsidiaries do not amortize
goodwill.

Other
acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value.  Intangibles
that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon
the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed
or otherwise used.

PPL and
its subsidiaries account for emission allowances as intangible
assets.  Since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not
diminished until they are consumed, emission allowances are not amortized;
rather they are expensed when consumed.  In addition, "vintage year"
swaps are accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS 153.

When
determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets
that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider:  the
expected use of the asset; the expected useful life of other assets to which the
useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or
contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; the company's historical
experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; the
effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and
the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future
cash flows from the asset.

See Note
21 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible
assets.

Asset
Impairment

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or
amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For a
long-lived asset to be held and used, an impairment exists when the carrying
value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the
asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying
value to its estimated fair value.  See Notes 9 and 15 for a
discussion of asset impairment charges recorded associated with long-lived
assets to be held and used.

For a
long-lived asset held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying value of
the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to
sell.  If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss
is recorded to adjust the carrying value of the asset (disposal group) to its
estimated fair value less cost to sell.  See Note 10 for a discussion
of charges recorded associated with long-lived assets held for
sale.

Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually or more
frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a
reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.  PPL's
reporting units are at or one level below its operating segments.  If
the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair
value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated.  The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
goodwill in a business combination.  If the implied fair value of
goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for
an amount equal to that difference.

PPL also
reviews the residual value of leased assets.  Residual value is the
estimated fair value of the leased property at the end of the lease
term.  If the residual value is determined to be less than the
residual value that was originally recorded for the property, PPL must determine
whether the decrease is other-than-temporary.  If so, the residual
value would be revised using the new estimate and a loss would be recorded
currently.  If the residual value is found to be greater than the
original, no adjustment is needed.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries account for the retirement of its long-lived assets according
to SFAS 143, which addresses the accounting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and FIN 47, which clarifies certain
aspects of SFAS 143.  SFAS 143 requires legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as liabilities in the
financial statements.  The initial obligation is measured at estimated
fair value.  An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the
value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of
the asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability is
increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement,
for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.  Estimated
ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various AROs
and the related assets, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material
changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the
obligations.

See Note
22 for a discussion of accounting for AROs.

Compensation
and Benefits

Defined
Benefits

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87 and SFAS
106 when accounting for these defined benefits.  In addition, PPL
adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS 158,
effective December 31, 2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS
158, PPL is required to record an asset or liability to recognize the funded
status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI or
regulatory assets for certain regulated subsidiaries.  Consequently,
the funded status of all defined benefit plans is now fully recognized on the
Balance Sheets and PPL no longer recognizes additional minimum liability
adjustments in OCI.

PPL uses
a market-related value of plan assets in accounting for its pension
plans.  The market-related value of plan assets is calculated by
rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions,
disbursements and expected return on investments.  One-fifth of the
difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or
subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new
market-related value.

PPL uses
an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for
its pension plans.  Under the accelerated method, gains and losses in
excess of 10% but less than 30% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan
participants.  Gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's
projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period equal to one-half of the average future service period of the plan
participants.

See Note
13 for a discussion of defined benefits.

Stock-Based
Compensation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
grants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
units to certain employees, and stock units and restricted stock units to
directors, under several stock-based compensation plans.  PPL and its
subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the
fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123(R).  Stock options with
graded vesting (i.e., that vest in installments) are valued as a single
award.  PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not
less than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of
grant.  See Note 12 for a discussion of stock-based
compensation.  Stock-based compensation is included in "Other
operation and maintenance" expense on the Statements of Income.

(PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's stock-based compensation expense includes an
allocation of PPL Services' expense.

Other

Income
Taxes

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
income tax provision for PPL and its subsidiaries is calculated in accordance
with SFAS 109.  PPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return.

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL's and its subsidiaries'
provision for income taxes primarily due to uncertainty in various tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred
tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances.

PPL and
its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.  The
adoption resulted in the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings in 2007.  Under FIN 48,
uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in
accordance with SFAS 5.  FIN 48 requires an entity to evaluate its tax
positions following a two-step process.  The first step requires an
entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a
particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance)
that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes
that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and be aware of
all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step
requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax
position that meets the recognition criterion.  The benefit recognized
is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of
realization that exceeds 50%.  If the more-likely-than-not threshold
is not met, it is inappropriate to recognize any tax benefits associated with
the tax position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of
issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts
accrued and may materially impact PPL's and its subsidiaries' financial
statements in the future.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating
losses and tax credit carryforwards.

PPL and
its subsidiaries record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  PPL and its
subsidiaries consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable
income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially
recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation
allowances.  If PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are able
to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred
tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing
tax expense in the period that such determination is made.  Likewise,
if PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are not able to realize all or
part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation
allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that
such determination is made.

PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric defer investment tax credits when the credits are
utilized and are amortizing the deferred amounts over the average lives of the
related assets.

See Note
5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes.

(PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in
accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that taxable
income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and any domestic
subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return.  PPL Energy
Supply's intercompany tax receivable was $15 million and $45 million at December
31, 2008 and 2007.  PPL Electric's intercompany tax receivable was $15
million and $49 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

The
provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based
upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and the
FERC.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for
regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP
is deferred and included on the Balance Sheet in taxes recoverable through
future rates in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL and in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Taxes recoverable through future
rates" for PPL Electric.

Taxes,
Other Than Income

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries present sales taxes in "Accounts Payable" and value-added taxes
in "Taxes" on their Balance Sheets.  These taxes are not reflected on
the Statements of Income.  See Note 5 for details on taxes included in
"Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income.

Leases

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries apply the provisions of SFAS 13 to all transactions that
qualify for lease accounting.  PPL and its subsidiaries apply EITF
01-8 to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease within the scope of
SFAS 13.  See Note 11 for a discussion of arrangements under which
PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are lessees for accounting
purposes.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
EnergyPlus has entered into several arrangements whereby PPL EnergyPlus is
considered the lessor for accounting purposes.  See Note 11 for
additional information.

Fuel, Materials and
Supplies

(PPL)

Fuel,
materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
average cost method, except for natural gas, for which the last-in, first-out
cost method (LIFO) was used prior to the sale of PPL's natural gas distribution
business in October 2008.  The carrying value of the LIFO inventory
was $14 million and the excess of replacement cost over carrying value was $13
million at December 31, 2007.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Fuel,
materials and supplies consisted of the following at December 31:

Fuel,
materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
average-cost method.

Guarantees

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

In
accordance with the provisions of FIN 45, the fair values of guarantees related
to arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2003, as well as
guarantees excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions of
FIN 45, are not recorded in the financial statements.  See Note 15 for
further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees.

Treasury
Stock

(PPL)

In 2006,
PPL retired all treasury shares, which totaled 62,174,729 shares, and restored
them to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  "Capital in
excess of par value" was reduced by $839 million as a result of the
retirement.  Total "Shareowners' Common Equity" was not
impacted.  PPL plans to restore all shares of common stock acquired in
the future to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon
acquisition.

Treasury
shares are not considered outstanding in calculating EPS.

(PPL
Electric)

In 2006,
PPL Electric retired all treasury shares, which totaled 90,932,326 shares, and
restored them to authorized but unissued shares of common
stock.  "Common stock" was reduced by $1.1 billion as a result of the
retirement.  Total "Shareowners' Equity" was not
impacted.  PPL Electric plans to restore all shares of common stock
acquired in the future to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon
acquisition.

Foreign Currency Translation
and Transactions

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Assets
and liabilities of international subsidiaries, where the local currency is the
functional currency, are translated at the exchange rates on the date of
consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the year.  Adjustments resulting from
translation are recorded in AOCI.  The effect of translation is
removed from AOCI upon the sale or substantial liquidation of the international
subsidiary that gave rise to the translation adjustment.  The local
currency is the functional currency for PPL's U.K. operating
company.

During
2008, the British pound sterling weakened in relation to the U.S.
dollar.  Changes in these exchange rates resulted in a foreign
currency translation loss of $520 million for 2008, which primarily
reflected a $1.1 billion reduction to PP&E, offset by a reduction of $580
million to other net liabilities.  Changes in exchange rates resulted
in a foreign currency translation gain of $65 million for 2007, which
primarily reflected a $173 million increase in PPE, offset by an increase of
$108 million to other net liabilities.

Gains or
losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in
income.  The net transaction losses were $2 million in 2008 and
insignificant in 2007 and 2006.

New
Accounting Standards Adopted

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN
46(R)-8

In
December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, which applies to
public entities that are subject to the disclosure requirements of SFAS 140 and
public enterprises that are subject to the disclosure requirements of FIN 46(R)
as amended by this FSP.  This FSP requires disclosures that provide
greater transparency about the extent of a transferor's continuing involvement
with transferred financial assets and an enterprise's involvement with a
variable interest entity.

PPL and
its subsidiaries adopted FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, prospectively, effective
December 31, 2008.  FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 was issued to
provide greater transparency within disclosures; therefore, the adoption did not
have a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial
statements.

SFAS 157

SFAS 157
provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for measuring fair
value.  In addition, SFAS 157 expands the fair value disclosure
requirements of other accounting pronouncements to require, among other things,
disclosure of the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value as well as
the earnings impact of certain fair value measurement
techniques.  SFAS 157 excludes from its scope fair value measurements
related to stock-based compensation.  See Note 18 for additional
information and related disclosures.

In
February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157, as originally issued, through the
issuance of FSP FAS 157-1 and FSP FAS 157-2.  FSP FAS 157-1 was
effective upon the initial adoption of SFAS 157 and amends SFAS 157 to exclude
from its scope certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value
measurements associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 was effective upon
issuance and delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis (at least annually).

PPL and
its subsidiaries initially adopted SFAS 157, prospectively, effective January 1,
2008.  Limited retrospective application for financial instruments
that were previously measured at fair value in accordance with footnote 3 of
EITF 02-3 was not required.  The January 1, 2008 adoption did not have
a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries.  In October 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, which was effective upon issuance and amends SFAS
157 to clarify its application in a market that is not active.  PPL
and its subsidiaries adopted FSP FAS 157-3, prospectively, effective July 1,
2008.  The adoption of FSP FAS 157-3 did not have a material effect on
PPL and its subsidiaries.

As
permitted by SFAS 157, PPL and its subsidiaries will apply SFAS 157,
prospectively, effective January 1, 2009, to nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in
the financial statements on a recurring basis.  PPL and its
subsidiaries are in the process of evaluating the impact of applying SFAS 157 to
these items.  The potential impact of the January 1, 2009 application
is not yet determinable, but is not expected to have a significant impact on PPL
and its subsidiaries.

Since PPL
and its subsidiaries elected to defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for
eligible assets and liabilities, the provisions of this standard were not
applied to intangible assets acquired and AROs recognized in
2008.  PPL and its subsidiaries also did not apply the standard to
determine any impairments of nonfinancial assets recognized during
2008.

SFAS 159

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which provides entities with an option
to measure, upon adoption of this standard and at specified election dates,
certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, as well as other eligible
items.  The fair value option (i) may be applied on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, with a few exceptions, (ii) is irrevocable
(unless a new election date occurs), and (iii) is applied to an entire
instrument and not to only specified risks, cash flows, or portions of that
instrument.  An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date.

SFAS 159
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between similar assets and liabilities measured using different
attributes.  Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect the fair
value option for eligible items that exist at that date and must report the
effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.

PPL and
its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 159 effective January 1, 2008.  PPL
and its subsidiaries did not elect the fair value option for eligible
items.  Therefore, the January 1, 2008 adoption did not have an impact
on PPL and its subsidiaries.

New Accounting Standards Pending
Adoption

Segment and Related Information

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL's
reportable segments are Supply, International Delivery and Pennsylvania
Delivery.  The Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic
energy marketing, domestic generation and domestic development operations of PPL
Energy Supply.  In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its domestic
telecommunication operations that were previously included in PPL's Supply
segment.  See Note 9 for additional information.  In 2006,
PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its interest in the Griffith
plant.  See Note 10 for additional information.

The
International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
electricity.  PPL Global's major remaining international business is
located in the U.K. In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Latin American
businesses.  See Note 10 for additional information.

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric delivery
operations of PPL Electric.  This segment also included the gas
delivery operations of PPL Gas Utilities prior to its sale in October
2008.  See Note 10 for additional information.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, the operating results of the Latin American
businesses, the natural gas distribution and propane businesses and the Griffith
plant have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statements of
Income.  Therefore, with the exception of net income, the operating
results from these businesses have been excluded from the income statement data
tables below.

PPL
Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International
Delivery.  The International Delivery segment at the PPL Energy Supply
level is consistent with the International Delivery segment at the PPL
level.  The Supply segment information reported at the PPL Energy
Supply level will not agree with the Supply segment information reported at the
PPL level because additional Supply segment functions exist at PPL that are
outside of PPL Energy Supply.  Furthermore, certain income items,
including PLR revenue and certain interest income, exist at the PPL Energy
Supply level but are eliminated in consolidation at the PPL
level.  Finally, certain expense items are fully allocated to the
segments at the PPL level only.

Segments
include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate service
costs, from PPL Services.  These service costs include functions such
as financial, legal, human resources and information services.  See
Note 16 for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

(PPL)

Basic EPS
is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding that are increased for
additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
were converted to common shares.  Potentially dilutive securities
consist of:

·

stock
      options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units
      granted under the incentive compensation plans;

·

While
they were outstanding, PPL Energy Supply's 2-5/8% Convertible Senior Notes due
2023 (Convertible Senior Notes) could be converted into shares of PPL common
stock under certain circumstances, including if during a fiscal quarter the
market price of PPL's common stock exceeded $29.83 per share over a certain
period during the proceeding fiscal quarter or if PPL Energy Supply called the
debt.

During
2008, all Convertible Senior Notes were either converted at the election of the
holders or redeemed at par by PPL Energy Supply.  No Convertible
Senior Notes were outstanding at December 31, 2008.  See Note 8 for
additional information.

The terms
of the Convertible Senior Notes required cash settlement of the principal amount
and permitted settlement of any conversion premium in cash or PPL common
stock.  Based upon the conversion rate of 40.2212 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes (or $24.8625 per share), the Convertible Senior Notes
had a dilutive impact when the average market price of PPL common stock equaled
or exceeded $24.87.

During
2008, PPL issued 1,059,728 shares of common stock related to the exercise of
stock options, vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and
conversion of stock units granted to directors under its stock-based
compensation plans.  See Note 12 for a discussion of PPL's stock-based
compensation plans.

historically been profitable.

Significant

PPL had
federal foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire by 2018 of $23 million and
$10 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.  PPL also had an
insignificant amount of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards at
December 31, 2007 that was fully utilized in 2008.  In addition,
PPL had state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2009 and 2028
of $209 million and $227 million at December 31, 2008 and
2007.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount that,
more likely than not, will not be realized.

PPL
Global had no foreign net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2008 and
$37 million at December 31, 2007.  PPL Global also had foreign capital
loss carryforwards of $451 million and $596 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007.  All of these losses have an indefinite carryforward
period.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount
that, more likely than not, will not be realized.  Of the total
valuation allowances related to foreign capital loss carryforwards, $63 million
is currently allocable to goodwill; however, upon adoption of SFAS 141(R),
effective January 1, 2009, all changes in valuation allowances associated with
business combinations will be recognized in tax expense rather than in
goodwill.  See Note 25 for additional information.

PPL
Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
WPD as management has determined that the earnings are permanently
reinvested.  The cumulative undistributed earnings are included in
"Earnings reinvested" on the Balance Sheets.  The amounts considered
permanently reinvested at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $1.2 billion and $1.1
billion.  If the earnings are remitted as dividends, PPL Global may be
subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax
credits.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

For tax
years 2000 through 2007, PPL Montana protested certain property tax assessments
by the Montana Department of Revenue on its generation
facilities.  The tax liabilities in dispute for 2000 through 2007,
which had been paid and expensed by PPL Montana, totaled $45
million.  In January 2008, both parties reached a settlement for all
years outstanding.  The settlement resulted in PPL Montana receiving a
refund of taxes paid and interest totaling $8 million.  This
settlement was recorded in 2008, of which $7 million was reflected in "Taxes,
other than income" and $1 million was reflected in "Other Income - net" on the
Statement of Income.  At December 31, 2008, the outstanding refund was
approximately $2 million.

basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards.

upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and the
FERC.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for
regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP
is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance

Unrecognized
      tax benefits associated with business combinations, if recognized would
      currently be allocated to goodwill.  Upon adoption of SFAS
      141(R), effective January 1, 2009, unrecognized tax benefits associated
      with business combinations, if recognized, will be recognized in tax
      expense and would decrease the effective tax rate.  See Note 25
      for additional information.

At
December 31, 2008, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by between $23 to $129
million for PPL, decrease between $28 million to $114 million for PPL Energy
Supply and decrease by up to $9 million for PPL Electric.  These decreases
could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the
measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign
taxes, the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact
on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of
certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing
groups.  The events that could cause these changes are direct
settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative
guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute
of limitation.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric had accrued interest
related to tax positions of $35 million, $28 million and $7
million.  At December 31, 2007, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric had accrued interest of $31 million, $26 million and $4
million.

PPL and
its subsidiaries recognize interest and penalties in "Income Taxes" on their
Statements of Income.  The following expenses (benefits) were
recognized at December 31:

The
amounts recognized during 2008 and 2007 for PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric were primarily the result of additional interest accrued or reversed
related to tax positions of prior years and the lapse of applicable statutes of
limitations, with respect to certain issues.

PPL or
its subsidiaries file tax returns in five major tax jurisdictions. PPL
Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's U.S. federal and state tax provision are
calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy with PPL, which
provides that their taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply and its
domestic subsidiaries and PPL Electric and its subsidiaries each filed a
separate consolidated tax return. Based on this tax sharing policy, PPL
Energy Supply or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in
five major tax jurisdictions and PPL Electric or its subsidiaries indirectly or
directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions.  With few
exceptions, at December 31, 2008, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years
that are no longer subject to examination, were as follows:

Financial Instruments

(PPL,

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, collateral on PLR
energy supply to/from affiliate, investments in the nuclear plant
decommissioning trust funds, other investments and short-term debt represented
or approximated fair value due to the liquid nature of the instruments, variable
interest rates associated with the financial instruments or existing
requirements to record the carrying value of the instruments at fair
value.  Price risk management assets and liabilities are also recorded
at fair value.  See Note 18 for additional
information.  Financial instruments where the carrying amount on the
Balance Sheets and the estimated fair value (based on quoted market prices for
the securities where available and estimates based on current rates where quoted
market prices are not available) are different, are set forth

agreements, certain retail energy and physical capacity contracts and certain
contracts to purchase emission allowances expected to be
consumed.  These contracts range in maturity through 2023 and have
been excluded from the requirements of SFAS 133 because they met the definition
of a "normal purchase or normal sale."  PPL Electric has also entered
into contracts that meet the definition of a "normal purchase or normal
sale."  See "Energy Purchase Commitments" within Note 15 for
information about PPL Electric's competitive solicitations.  All of
these contracts are accounted for using the accrual method of accounting;
therefore, there were no amounts recorded on the Balance Sheets at December 31,
2008 and 2007.  The estimated fair value of these contracts at

Holders
of the outstanding preferred stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters
on which PPL Electric's shareowners are entitled to vote.  However, if

to elect a majority of the Board of Directors of PPL Electric.

Preference
Stock

Holders
of the depositary shares, each of which represents a quarter interest in a share
of Preference Shares, are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of
the Preference Shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation
rights, exercised through the bank acting as a depositary.  The
Preference Shares rank senior to PPL Electric's common stock and junior to its
preferred stock, they have no voting rights, except as provided by law and they
have a liquidation preference of $100 per share.

Dividends
on the Preference Shares will be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, or $1.5625 per depositary share per
year, and are not cumulative.  PPL Electric may not pay dividends on,
or redeem, purchase or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its
common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends on the
Preference Shares have been paid for the then-current dividend
period.

PPL
Energy Supply usually maintains a commercial paper program, under which
commercial paper issuances are supported by its credit facilities, to provide an
additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when
necessary.  During 2008 and 2007, PPL Energy Supply had a commercial

(a)

The
      committed capacity of this facility was reduced from $200 million to
      approximately $190 million in December 2008 as a result of terminating the
      commitment of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which became a defaulting lender
      on its commitment in October 2008.

Under
      this facility, PPL Electric has the ability to make cash borrowings and to
      cause the lenders to issue letters of credit.  Borrowings
      generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon
      the company's public debt rating.  The borrowing outstanding at
      December 31, 2008 bears interest at 2.44%.  Under certain
      conditions, PPL Electric may elect to have the principal balance of the
      loans outstanding on the final expiration date of the facility continue as
      non-revolving term loans for a period of one year from that final
      expiration date.  Also, under certain conditions, PPL Electric
      may request that the facility's principal amount be increased by up to
      $100 million.

This
      credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring debt to total
      capitalization to not exceed 70%.

(b)

PPL
      Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through
      which PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its
      eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose,
      wholly-owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary has
      pledged these assets to secure loans from a commercial paper conduit
      sponsored by a financial institution.  The credit agreement
      related to PPL Electric's and the subsidiary's participation in a $150
      million asset-backed commercial paper program expired in July
      2008.  In August 2008, PPL Electric and the subsidiary entered
      into a new credit agreement governing a similar asset-backed commercial
      paper program with a different financial institution and commercial paper
      conduit that expires in July 2009.  The borrowing limit under
      such program continues to be $150 million.  PPL Electric uses
      the proceeds under the credit facility for general corporate purposes and,
      prior to August 2008, to cash collateralize letters of
      credit.  The subsidiary's borrowing costs under the credit
      facility vary based on the commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue
      commercial paper that supports the debt.  Borrowings under this
      program are subject to customary conditions precedent, as well as the
      requirement that PPL Electric discharge a conditional lien that could
      attach to the accounts receivable upon a default under PPL Electric's 1945
      First Mortgage Bond Indenture.  This discharge was completed in
      December 2008.

At
      December 31, 2008 and 2007, $76 million and $126 million of accounts
      receivable and $170 million and $171 million of unbilled revenue were
      pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement related to PPL
      Electric's and the subsidiary's participation in the asset-backed
      commercial paper program.  At December 31, 2008, there was no
      short-term debt outstanding under the credit facility.  At
      December 31, 2007, there was $41 million of short-term debt outstanding
      under the credit facility at an interest rate of 5.11%, all of which was
      being used to cash collateralize letters of credit issued on PPL
      Electric's behalf.  At December 31, 2008, based on the accounts
      receivable and unbilled revenue pledged, $101 million was available for
      borrowing.  The funds used to cash collateralize the letters of
      credit are reported in "Restricted cash and cash equivalents" on the
      Balance Sheet.  PPL Electric's sale to its subsidiary of the
      accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute sale of the
      assets, and PPL Electric does not retain an interest in these
      assets.  However, for financial reporting purposes, the
      subsidiary's financial results are consolidated in PPL Electric's
      financial statements.  PPL Electric performs certain
      record-keeping and cash collection functions with respect to the assets in
      return for a servicing fee from the
subsidiary.

PPL
Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and
when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL
Electric's five-year syndicated credit facility that expires in May 2012 based
on available capacity.  PPL Electric had no commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In 2001,
PPL Electric completed a strategic initiative to confirm its legal separation
from PPL and PPL's other affiliated companies.  This initiative was
designed to enable PPL Electric to substantially reduce its exposure to
volatility in energy prices and supply risks through 2009 and to reduce its
business and financial risk profile by, among other things, limiting its
business activities to the transmission and distribution of electricity and
businesses related to or arising out of the electric transmission and
distribution businesses.  In connection with this initiative, PPL
Electric:

The
enhancements to PPL Electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended
to minimize the risk that a court would order PPL Electric's assets and
liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of PPL or another
affiliate of PPL in the event that PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become a
debtor in a bankruptcy case.  Based on these various measures, PPL
Electric was able to issue and maintain a higher level of debt and use it to
replace higher cost equity, thereby maintaining a lower total cost of
capital.  Nevertheless, if PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become
a debtor in a bankruptcy case, there can be no assurance that a court would not
order PPL Electric's assets and liabilities to be consolidated with those of PPL
or such other PPL affiliate.

The
subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities.  PPL's subsidiaries
are not liable for the debts of PPL.  Accordingly, creditors of PPL
may not satisfy their debts from the assets of the subsidiaries absent a
specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as
required by applicable law or regulation.  Similarly, absent a
specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation,
PPL is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries.  Accordingly,
creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of
PPL absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL to pay the creditors of its
subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or regulation.

Similarly,
the subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are separate legal
entities.  These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric.  Accordingly, creditors of PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their
subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay
the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.  In
addition, absent a specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable
law or regulation, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are not liable for the
debts of their subsidiaries.  Accordingly, creditors of these
subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Energy Supply or
PPL Electric absent a specific contractual undertaking by that parent to pay the
creditors of its subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or
regulation.

Financing
Activities

(PPL)

In August
2008, PPL Gas Utilities prepaid the entire $10 million aggregate principal
amount of its 8.70% Senior Notes due December 2022.  PPL Gas Utilities
paid a premium of $3 million in connection with the prepayment.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In March
2008, PPL Energy Supply issued $400 million of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2018
(6.50% Notes).  The 6.50% Notes may be redeemed any time prior to
maturity at PPL Energy Supply's option at make-whole redemption
prices.  PPL Energy Supply received proceeds of $396 million, net of a
discount and underwriting fees, from the issuance of the 6.50%
Notes.  The proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes,
including capital expenditures relating to the installation of pollution control
equipment by PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries.

In April
2008, PPL Energy Supply elected to change the interest rate mode on the Exempt
Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2007 due 2037 (Series 2007 Bonds) that were
issued by the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Energy Supply in December
2007.  The interest rate mode was converted from a rate that was reset
daily through daily remarketing of the Series 2007 Bonds to a term rate of 1.80%
for one year.  In connection with this change, the letter of credit
supporting the Series 2007 Bonds was modified accordingly.

The terms
of PPL Energy Supply's 2-5/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (Convertible
Senior Notes) included a market price trigger that permitted holders to convert
the notes during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of PPL's common
stock exceeded $29.83 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal
quarter.  The holders of the Convertible Senior Notes also had the
right to require PPL Energy Supply to purchase all or any part (equal to $1,000
principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of the Convertible Senior
Notes on May 15, 2008 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon as of such date.  In April 2008, the holders were
notified that, in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, PPL
Energy Supply was redeeming on May 20, 2008, all outstanding Convertible Senior
Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
as of such date.

The
Convertible Senior Notes were subject to conversion at the election of the
holders any time prior to May 20, 2008 at a conversion rate of 40.2212 shares
per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or $24.8625 per share) as a result of the
market price trigger being met and the notes being called for
redemption.  Upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, PPL
Energy Supply was required to settle the principal amount in cash and any
conversion premium in cash or PPL common stock.  During 2008,
Convertible Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $57 million were
presented for conversion.  The total conversion premium related to
these conversions was $56 million, which was settled with 1,128,341 shares of
PPL common stock, together with an insignificant amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares.  On May 20, 2008, PPL Energy Supply redeemed an
insignificant amount of Convertible Senior Notes.  No Convertible
Senior Notes remain outstanding.

In July
2008, PPL Energy Supply issued $300 million of 6.30% Senior Notes due 2013
(6.30% Notes).  The 6.30% Notes may be redeemed any time prior to
maturity at PPL Energy Supply's option at make-whole redemption
prices.  PPL Energy Supply received proceeds of $298 million, net of a
discount and underwriting fees, from the issuance of the 6.30%
Notes.  The proceeds were used to repay short-term debt that was
outstanding at the time of issuance.

In
December 2008, the PEDFA issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of
Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2008A and 2008B (PPL Energy Supply, LLC
Project) due 2038 (Series 2008 Bonds) on behalf of PPL Energy
Supply.  The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds were
used to finance a portion of the installation of sulfur dioxide scrubbers at the
Montour, Brunner Island and Keystone generating stations.  The Series
2008 Bonds are structured as variable-rate remarketable bonds.  PPL
Energy Supply may convert the interest rate on the Series 2008 Bonds from time
to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate or a term rate of at
least one year.  The Series 2008 Bonds are subject to mandatory
purchase under certain circumstances, including upon conversion to a different
interest rate mode.  The Series 2008 Bonds bear interest at an initial
rate of 5.50% through March 15, 2009, at which time the Series 2008 Bonds will
be subject to weekly remarketing until such time that the interest rate mode is
changed at the election of PPL Energy Supply.

PPL
Investment Corporation, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, acted as the initial
purchaser of the Series 2008 Bonds upon issuance.  PPL Energy Supply
expects that the Series 2008 Bonds will be remarketed to unaffiliated investors
in 2009, subject to market conditions.  At December 31, 2008, these
investments were reflected in "Short-term investments" on the Balance
Sheet.

In
connection with the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds by the PEDFA, PPL Energy
Supply entered into loan agreements with the PEDFA pursuant to which it loaned
PPL Energy Supply the proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds on payment terms that
correspond to those of the Series 2008 Bonds.  PPL Energy Supply
issued notes to the PEDFA to evidence its obligations under the loan
agreements.

In
December 2008, WPDH Limited retired $225 million of 6.50% Senior Notes upon
maturity, and received $16 million upon the maturity of related cross-currency
swaps.  The $16 million is netted with the retirement of the notes in
"Retirement of long-term debt" on the Statement of Cash
Flows.  Although financial information of foreign subsidiaries is
recorded on a one-month lag, these December 2008 transactions are reflected in
the 2008 Financial Statements due to the materiality of the
retirement.

On
February 17, 2009, PPL Energy Supply initiated cash tender offers for up to $250
million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding senior
notes.  The series of notes, in order of their priority level for
acceptance by PPL Energy Supply, are as follows:  6.00% Senior Notes
due 2036, 6.20% Senior Notes due 2016 and 5.40% Senior Notes due
2014.  The tender offer for each series of notes expires on March 16,
2009.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In
October 2008, PPL Electric issued $400 million of 7.125% Senior Secured Bonds
due 2013 (7.125% Bonds).  The 7.125% Bonds were issued on the basis of
an equal principal amount of first mortgage bonds issued under the 1945 First
Mortgage Bond Indenture pledged to the Senior Secured Bond Indenture
Trustee.  The 7.125% Bonds may be redeemed any time prior to maturity
at PPL Electric's option at make-whole redemption prices.  PPL
Electric received proceeds of $397 million, net of a discount and underwriting
fees, from the issuance of the 7.125% Bonds.  The proceeds will be
used to partially fund the repayment at maturity of approximately $486 million
outstanding aggregate principal amount of PPL Electric's Senior Secured Bonds,
6-1⁄4% Series, due August 2009.  Prior to such use, the proceeds will
be invested in short-term instruments and used for general corporate
purposes.

In
October 2008, the PEDFA issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2008 (PPL Electric Utilities
Corporation Project) due 2023 (PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds) on behalf of PPL
Electric in order to refund $90 million aggregate principal amount of Pollution
Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2003, which were previously issued by
the Lehigh County Industrial Development Authority on behalf of PPL Electric and
matured on November 1, 2008.  The PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds are
structured as variable-rate remarketable bonds.  PPL Electric may
convert the interest rate on the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds from time to
time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate or a term rate of at
least one year.  The PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds are subject to
mandatory purchase under certain circumstances, including upon conversion to a
different interest rate mode.  PPL Electric acted as initial purchaser
of the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds upon issuance.

In
connection with the issuance of the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds by the PEDFA,
PPL Electric entered into a loan agreement with the PEDFA pursuant to which it
loaned PPL Electric the proceeds of the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds on
payment terms that correspond to the PPL Electric Series 2008
Bonds.  PPL Electric issued a note to the PEDFA to evidence its
obligations under the loan agreement.

Concurrent
with, and as a condition to, the issuance of the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds,
PPL Electric issued to the Trustee of the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds, its
Senior Secured Bonds, Variable Rate Pollution Control Series 2008, which contain
payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest
as the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds.  Such senior secured bonds were
issued under the 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture.

In
November 2008, PPL Electric remarketed the PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds to
unaffiliated investors and elected to change the interest rate mode from the
weekly rate mode to a term rate mode.  The bonds are currently in a
term rate mode and bear interest at 4.85% until October 2010, at which time the
bonds will be remarketed based upon the interest rate mode elected by PPL
Electric.

PPL
Electric's senior secured bonds were secured by first mortgage bonds held by the
Senior Secured Bond Indenture Trustee and the lien of the 2001 Senior Secured
Bond Indenture, which was junior to the lien of the 1945 First Mortgage Bond
Indenture.  The 1945 First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the 2001 Senior
Secured Bond Indenture created liens on substantially all of PPL Electric's
distribution properties and certain of its transmission properties, which liens
may be released subject to certain circumstances and conditions, and subject to
certain exceptions and exclusions.

In
December 2008, PPL Electric completed an in-substance defeasance of its
outstanding 7.70% First Mortgage Bonds (7.70% Bonds) due 2009 and 7.375% First
Mortgage Bonds (7.375% Bonds) due 2014 by depositing $15 million with the
trustee.  The 7.70% Bonds and the 7.375% Bonds had been the only
remaining bonds outstanding under the 1945 First Mortgage Bond Indenture, other
than the bonds delivered to the Senior Secured Bond Indenture Trustee to secure
Senior Secured Bonds.  The $15 million deposit will be used solely to
satisfy the principal and remaining interest obligations on the bonds and is
recorded in "Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents" on the Balance
Sheet.  See Note 20 for additional information.

In
connection with the in-substance defeasance of the outstanding First Mortgage
Bonds, PPL Electric discharged the lien under the 1945 First Mortgage Bond
Indenture and cancelled the related first mortgage bonds delivered to the Senior
Secured Bond Indenture Trustee as the basis for issuance of senior secured bonds
in accordance with the terms of the 2001 Senior Secured Bond
Indenture.  The Senior Secured Bonds continue to be secured by the
lien of the 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture, which has become a first lien,
subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions, on substantially all of PPL
Electric's tangible electric distribution properties and certain of its
transmission properties.

During
2008, PPL Transition Bond Company made principal payments on transition bonds of
$305 million.  No transition bonds remain
outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

(PPL)

In June
2007, PPL's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by PPL of up to $750
million of its common stock.  As of December 31, 2008, a total of
15,732,708 shares were repurchased for $750 million, excluding related fees,
under the plan.  This includes the purchase of 802,816 shares of PPL
common stock for $38 million in 2008.  These purchases were primarily
recorded as a reduction to "Capital in excess of par value" on the Balance
Sheet.

Distributions,
Capital Contributions and Related Restrictions

(PPL)

In
February 2008, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend,
effective April 1, 2008, to 33.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.34 per
annum).  In February 2009, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly
common stock dividend, effective April 1, 2009, to 34.5 cents per share
(equivalent to $1.38 per annum).  Future dividends, declared at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings,
cash flows, financial requirements and other factors.

Neither
PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution
on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers
interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due
2067.  At December 31, 2008, no interest payments were
deferred.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The PPL
Montana Colstrip lease places certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to
declare dividends.  At this time, PPL believes that these covenants
will not limit PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's ability to operate as desired and
will not affect their ability to meet any of their cash
obligations.  WPD subsidiaries also have financing arrangements that
limit their ability to pay dividends.  However, PPL does not, at this
time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL's or
PPL Energy Supply's ability to meet their cash obligations.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

During
2008, PPL Energy Supply distributed $750 million to its parent company, PPL
Energy Funding, and received cash capital contributions of $421
million.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments on its
common stock in the event that PPL Electric fails to meet an interest coverage
ratio test, as defined in the indenture, or fails to comply with certain
requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to maintain
its separateness from PPL and PPL's other subsidiaries.  At December
31, 2008, PPL Electric was in compliance with the interest coverage ratio
test.  PPL Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of such
limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare
dividends.

As
discussed in Note 7, PPL Electric may not pay dividends on its common stock,
except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends have been paid on the
Preference Shares for the then-current dividend period.  The quarterly
dividend rate for PPL Electric's Preference Shares is $1.5625 per
share.  PPL Electric has declared and paid dividends on its
outstanding Preference Shares since issuance.  Dividends on the
Preference Shares are not cumulative and future dividends, declared at the
discretion of PPL Electric's Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future
earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors.

PPL
Electric is subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it
unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds "properly
included in capital account."  The meaning of this limitation has
never been clarified under the Federal Power Act.  PPL Electric
believes, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to its
circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the
payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for
lawful and legitimate business purposes.

Electric)

During
2008, PPL Electric paid common stock dividends of $98 million to
PPL.

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries continuously evaluate strategic options and, from time to time,
PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third parties
regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets, joint ventures
and development projects, which may or may not result in definitive
agreements.  Any such transactions may impact future financial
results.  See Note 10 for sales of businesses that were presented as
discontinued operations by PPL and PPL Energy Supply.

Domestic

License
Renewals

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

In 2006,
PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for 20-year license renewals for each of the
Susquehanna units to extend their expiration dates from 2022 to 2042 for Unit 1
and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2.  The results of an August 2008
safety inspection of the Susquehanna plant by the NRC support a conclusion that
there is a reasonable assurance that aging effects will be adequately
managed.  The inspection was part of the NRC's review of PPL's
application to renew the operating license.  The inspection showed
that PPL's assessment of the impact that aging of non-safety related systems at
the plant could have on safety equipment was acceptable.  The
inspectors also found that PPL's aging management programs can handle the
effects of aging on plant equipment and systems, and that documentation related
to the programs could be retrieved and audited.

An NRC
review of the environmental impact of relicensing is being conducted
separately.  The NRC expects to issue that report in March
2009.  A final decision on the license renewal is expected to be
issued in December 2009.

Development

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
December 2007, PPL asked the FERC for approval to expand the capacity of its
Holtwood hydroelectric plant by 125 MW.  In December 2008, PPL
announced that it had withdrawn the application in light of current economic
conditions, including the high cost of capital, and projections of future energy
prices.  The expansion project would have had an estimated capital
cost of $440 million.  Cancellation of the project resulted in PPL
Energy Supply recording in its Supply segment, an impairment of $22 million ($13
million after tax) which is included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the
Statements of Income.

PPL plans
to redevelop the Rainbow hydroelectric facility, near Great Falls, Montana, for
a total plant capacity of 60 MW, at an expected capital cost of $192
million.  The redevelopment is anticipated to increase generation by
28 MW.  This planned expansion, expected to be completed in 2012, is
subject to various regulatory approvals and other conditions, and PPL cannot
predict whether or when these approvals will be obtained or the other conditions
will be met.

In
January 2008, PPL Susquehanna received NRC approval for its request to increase
the generation capacity of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The total
expected capacity increase is 159 MW, of which PPL Susquehanna's share
would be 143 MW.  The first uprate for Unit 1 totaling 50 MW was
completed in May 2008.  The remaining total expected capacity increase
is 109 MW, of which PPL Susquehanna's share would be
98 MW.  PPL Susquehanna's share of the expected capital cost for
this project is $345 million, and PPL expects to achieve the full capacity
increase of 159 MW after the refueling outage in 2010 for
Unit 1.

In
September 2008, a PPL subsidiary submitted Part I of an application to the DOE
for a federal loan guarantee for the proposed Bell Bend nuclear generating unit
(Bell Bend) to be built adjacent to PPL's Susquehanna plant.  The
subsidiary submitted Part II of the loan guarantee application in December
2008.   There is considerable uncertainty about the likelihood of
DOE financial support for the project due to the current level of appropriations
available to DOE for this purpose ($18.5 billion appropriated by the U.S.
Congress to date) and the number of projects competing for those
resources.  The DOE recently selected five projects for a first tier
and five projects for a second tier.  The first tier projects are to
receive further evaluation by the agency.  Bell Bend was placed in the
second tier.  This preliminary tier selection process is not final,
nor does it indicate that only those projects in the first tier remain in the
running for DOE guarantees.   Bell Bend will submit its first
quarterly application update to the DOE by March 19, 2009 and will continue
making quarterly updates throughout 2009 in order to remain active in the
process.  PPL cannot predict whether additional appropriations will be
made for the DOE loan guarantee program, which proposed nuclear projects will
ultimately be granted DOE loan guarantees, or the specific impact of these and
other factors on the potential construction of the Bell Bend
project.

In
October 2008, a PPL subsidiary submitted a COLA to the NRC for Bell
Bend.  The COLA was accepted for review by the NRC in December
2008.  Submittal of the COLA by the end of 2008 met the first
requirement to qualify for federal production tax credits and loan guarantees,
as provided under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Another PPL
subsidiary contracted with UniStar Nuclear Services, LLC, an affiliate of
UniStar Nuclear Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Constellation Energy
Nuclear Group, LLC and EDF Development, Inc., to prepare the
application.  The facility for which the application was submitted is
based on the U.S. Evolutionary Power Reactor design developed by AREVA NP, Inc.
and its affiliates.  PPL and its subsidiaries are currently authorized
by PPL's Board of Directors to spend up to $90 million on the COLA and other
permits necessary for construction.

PPL has
made no decision to proceed with construction of the Bell Bend nuclear
generating unit and expects that such decision will not be made for several
years given the anticipated lengthy NRC license approval
process.  Additionally, PPL has announced that it would not proceed to
construction absent a joint arrangement with other interested parties and
without a federal loan guarantee or other acceptable financing
structures.  Through December 31, 2008, $58 million of costs
associated with the licensing effort were capitalized as an intangible asset, as
PPL deems it probable that these costs are ultimately
recoverable.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In June
2007, PJM directed the construction of a new 130-mile, 500-kilovolt transmission
line between the Susquehanna substation in Pennsylvania and the Roseland
substation in New Jersey that has been identified as essential to long-term
reliability of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid.  PJM determined that
the line is needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur in the next
decade on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM
system.  PJM has directed PPL Electric to construct the portion of the
Susquehanna-Roseland line in Pennsylvania and has directed Public Service
Electric & Gas Company (PSE&G) to construct the portion of the line in
New Jersey by June 1, 2012.  PPL Electric's estimated share of the
project costs at December 31, 2008 was $509 million.  This project is
pending certain regulatory approvals.

PPL
Electric has identified the approximately 100-mile route for the Pennsylvania
portion of the line, and in January 2009 filed an application with the PUC to
site and construct the line.  Review by the PUC is anticipated to be
completed in one year.

In
December 2007, PPL Electric and PSE&G filed a joint petition for a
declaratory order with the FERC requesting approval of transmission rate
incentives for the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line.  The
companies requested (1) an additional 1.5% allowed rate of return on equity, (2)
recognition of construction work in progress in rate base, (3) recovery of all
costs if the project is cancelled and (4) an additional 0.5% allowed rate of
return on equity for membership in PJM.  In April 2008, the FERC
approved the filing and granted all of the requested incentives except that the
additional allowed rate of return on equity was approved at 1.25%.

and PPL Energy Supply)

Sale of Telecommunication
Operations

In the
first quarter of 2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for the
transport operations of its domestic telecommunications subsidiary, which
offered fiber optic capacity to other telecommunications companies and
enterprise customers.  The operating results of this subsidiary were
included in the Supply segment.  Due to a combination of significant
capital requirements for the telecommunication operations and competing capital
needs in PPL's core electricity supply and delivery businesses, PPL decided to
actively market these telecommunication operations.  As a result, PPL
and PPL Energy Supply recorded an initial impairment of $31 million ($18 million
after tax) of the telecommunication assets based on their estimated fair
value.  The transport operations did not meet the criteria for
discontinued operations presentation on the Statement of Income because there
were not separate and distinguishable cash flows, among other
factors.

In May
2007, PPL reached a definitive agreement to sell its telecommunication
operations and in August 2007 completed the sale.  As a result,
additional impairments of $8 million ($5 million after tax) were
recognized.  The impairments are included in "Energy-related
businesses" expenses on the Statement of Income.  PPL realized net
proceeds of $47 million from the sale.

Acquisition of a Long-term
Tolling Agreement

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  The tolling agreement extends through 2021 and is
considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes that was determined to be
an operating lease.  As a result of this agreement, PPL EnergyPlus
recognized an intangible asset.  See Notes 11 and 21 for additional
information.

Other

In 2004,
PPL Maine entered into an agreement with a coalition of government agencies and
private groups to sell three of its nine hydroelectric dams in
Maine.  Under the agreement, a non-profit organization designated by
the coalition would have a five-year option to purchase the dams for $25
million, and PPL Maine would receive rights to increase energy output at its
other hydroelectric dams in Maine.  The coalition has announced plans
to remove or bypass the dams subject to the agreement in order to restore runs
of Atlantic salmon and other migratory fish to the Penobscot
River.  In June 2008, the coalition notified PPL Maine of its intent
to exercise the purchase option.  The agreement requires updates to
the representations and warranties in the purchase and sale agreement, and
several approvals by the FERC.  In November 2008, PPL Maine and the
coalition filed a request with FERC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Maine DEP to approve the transfer of ownership for the three
dams.  Certain of these required regulatory approvals have been
obtained, but PPL cannot predict whether or when all of them will be
obtained.

In 2000,
WPD acquired Hyder.  Subsequently, WPD sold the majority of Hyder's
non-electricity delivery businesses and placed the remaining companies in
liquidation.  WPD has periodically received distributions related to
these ongoing liquidations.  These distributions are included in
"Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income as detailed in
Note 17.  The Hyder non-electricity delivery businesses are
substantially liquidated at December 31, 2008.  WPD continues to
operate the former Hyder electricity delivery business, now named WPD (South
Wales).

In 2006,
WPD received legal notification citing one of its real estate investments as an
environmentally protected area, thus restricting planned
development.  An impairment assessment was performed based on a
third-party appraisal.  As a result, WPD recorded an impairment charge
of $8 million ($6 million after tax), which is included in "Other Income - net"
on the Statement of Income.

Sale of Latin American
Businesses

In March
2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for its Latin American
businesses and announced its intention to sell its regulated electricity
delivery businesses in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia, which were included in
the International Delivery segment.

In April
2007, PPL agreed to sell its Bolivian businesses.  As a result, in
2007, PPL recorded impairments totaling $37 million ($20 million after tax) to
reflect the estimated fair value of the businesses at the date the agreement was
reached.  This sale was completed in July 2007.

In May
2007, PPL completed the sale of its El Salvadoran business for $180 million in
cash.  PPL recorded a gain of $94 million ($89 million after tax) as a
result of the sale.

In
November 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Chilean business for $660 million
in cash.  PPL recorded a gain of $306 million ($197 million after tax)
as a result of the sale.

In 2008,
PPL Global recognized income tax adjustments and other expenses in Discontinued
Operations in connection with the dissolution of the remaining Latin American
holding companies.  This process was substantially complete at
December 31, 2008.

Sale of Gas and Propane
Businesses

In July
2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for its natural gas
distribution and propane businesses and announced its intention to sell these
businesses, which are included in the Pennsylvania Delivery
segment.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, management assessed the carrying value of the assets
and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2007.  Based on the

expectation
that the natural gas distribution and propane assets would be sold and an
assessment of prevailing market conditions, an impairment charge of $22 million
was recorded in 2007.  An associated income tax benefit of $1 million
was also recorded.

In March
2008, PPL signed a definitive agreement to sell these businesses for $268
million in cash, adjusted for working capital at the sale date, pursuant to a
stock purchase agreement.  PPL completed the sale in October
2008.  Proceeds from the sale of $303 million, including estimated
working capital, were contributed to PPL Energy Supply through its parent, PPL
Energy Funding.  In 2008, PPL recorded impairment and other charges
related to the sale totaling $10 million ($6 million after tax).  Also
in 2008, PPL Gas Utilities paid a $3 million ($2 million after tax) premium to
prepay the entire $10 million aggregate principal of its 8.70% Senior Notes due
December 2022.

In
February 2009, PPL recognized an insignificant charge in Discontinued Operations
in connection with the settlement of the working capital
adjustment.

At
December 31, 2007, the assets and liabilities were classified as held for
sale on the Balance Sheet.  The following results of operations for
the natural gas distribution and propane businesses have been classified as

Tolling
Agreement

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement for the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  Under the agreement, PPL EnergyPlus has control over the
plant's dispatch into the electricity grid and will supply the natural gas
necessary to operate the plant.  The tolling agreement extends through
2021 and is considered to contain a lease for accounting purposes, which was
determined to be an operating lease.  The fixed payments under the
tolling agreement are subject to adjustment based upon changes to the facility
capacity rating, which may occur up to twice per year.  Certain costs
within the tolling agreement, primarily non-lease costs, are subject to
escalation.

Colstrip Generating
Plant

At
December 31, 2008, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
transaction.  In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the
Colstrip generating plants to owner lessors who are leasing a 50% interest in
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3 back to PPL Montana under
four 36-year non-cancelable leases.  This transaction is accounted for
as an operating lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements
related to sale/leaseback arrangements.  These leases provide two
renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation
assets.  PPL Montana currently amortizes material leasehold
improvements over no more than the remaining life of the original
leases.  PPL Montana is required to pay all expenses associated with
the operations of the generation units.  The leases place certain
restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and
declare dividends and require PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios
related to cash flow and net worth.  There are no residual value
guarantees in these leases.  However, upon an event of default or an
event of loss, PPL Montana could be required to pay a termination value of
amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor
notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment and anticipated return
on investment.  The events of default include payment defaults,
breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness of
PPL Montana, change in control of PPL Montana and certain bankruptcy
events.  The termination value was estimated to be $708 million at
December 31, 2008.

Kerr Dam

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Montana continued to participate in a lease arrangement
with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead
Reservation.  Under a joint operating license, issued by the FERC
to Montana Power in 1985, and subsequently to PPL Montana as a result of the
purchase of Kerr Dam from Montana Power, PPL Montana is responsible to make
payments to the tribes, for the use of their property.  This
agreement, subject to escalation based upon inflation, extends until the end of
the license term in 2035.  Between 2015 and 2025, the tribes have the
option to purchase, hold and operate the project, which would result in the
termination of this leasing arrangement.

PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Other
Leases

In
September 2006, PPL's subsidiaries terminated the master lease agreements under
which they leased equipment, such as vehicles, computers and office
equipment.  In addition, PPL and its subsidiaries purchased the
equipment from the lessors at a negotiated price.  Prior to the
buyout, PPL subsidiaries had been directly charged or allocated a portion of the
rental expense related to the assets they utilized.  In connection
with the buyout, ownership of the purchased equipment was reviewed and
attributed to the subsidiaries based on usage of the equipment.

PPL and

Stock-Based Compensation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Under the
PPL Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) and the Incentive Compensation Plan for
Key Employees (ICPKE) (together, the Plans), restricted shares of PPL common
stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be
granted to officers and other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL
Electric and other affiliated companies.  Awards under the Plans are
made by the Compensation Governance and Nominating Committee (CGNC) of the PPL
Board of Directors, in the case of the ICP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership
Council (CLC), in the case of the ICPKE.  The ICP limits the total
number of awards that may be granted under it after April 23, 1999, to
15,769,430 awards, or 5% of the total shares of PPL common stock that were
outstanding at April 23, 1999.  The ICPKE limits the total number
of awards that may be granted under it after April 25, 2003, to 16,573,608
awards, or 5% of the total shares of PPL common stock that were outstanding at
January 1, 2003, reduced by outstanding awards of 2,373,812, for which PPL
common stock was not yet issued as of April 25, 2003, resulting in a limit of
14,199,796.  In addition, each Plan limits the number of shares
available for awards in any calendar year to 2% of the outstanding common stock
of PPL on the first day of such calendar year.  The maximum number of
options that can be awarded under each Plan to any single eligible employee in
any calendar year is three million shares.  Any portion of these
options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent
year.  If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the
participant terminate, the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award
are again available for grant.  Shares delivered under the Plans may
be in the form of authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in
treasury by PPL or PPL common stock purchased on the open market (including
private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws.

Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted
shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend
rights.  Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for
key executives and vest when the recipient reaches age 60.  The shares
are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under Plan provisions for
termination, retirement, disability and death of
employees.  Restricted shares vest fully if control of PPL changes, as
defined by the plans.

The Plans
allow for the grant of restricted stock units.  Restricted stock units
are awards based on the fair market value of PPL common stock.  Actual
PPL common shares will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally
three years.  Recipients of restricted stock units may also be granted
the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction
period or until the award is forfeited.  Restricted stock units are
subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the Plan provisions for
termination, retirement, disability and death of
employees.  Restricted stock units vest fully if control of PPL
changes, as defined by the Plans.

Performance
Units

PPL began
granting performance units in 2008.  Performance units are intended to
encourage and award future performance.  Performance units represent a
target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the officer
would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance
goal.  Performance is determined based on total shareowner return
during a three-year performance period.  At the end of the period,
payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the total shareowner
return of the companies included in an Index Group, in this case the S&P
Electric Utilities Index.  Awards are payable on a graduated basis
within the following ranges:  if PPL's performance is at or above the
85th percentile of the Index Group, the award is paid at 200% of the Target
Award; at the 50th percentile of the Index Group, the award is paid at 100% of
the Target Award; at the 40th percentile of the Index Group, the award is paid
at 50% of the Target Award; and below the 40th percentile, no award is
payable.  Dividends payable on performance units during the
performance cycle accumulate and will be distributed in cash upon completion of
the performance period. Under the Plan provisions, performance units are subject
to forfeiture upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability
or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units remain
outstanding and eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance
period.  Performance units vest on a pro rata basis if control of PPL
changes, as defined by the Plan.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Electric's unrecognized compensation cost was
insignificant and the weighted-average period for recognition was 2.1
years.

The
estimated fair value of each performance unit granted was calculated using a
Monte Carlo pricing model that considers historic volatility over three years
using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the Index
Group.  Volatility over the expected term of the performance units is
evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded
based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and companies in the
Index Group.

The
weighted-average assumptions used in the model were:

Stock
Options

Under the
Plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share
not less than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of
grant.  The options are exercisable in installments beginning one year
after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by PPL or a
subsidiary.  Options outstanding at December 31, 2008, become
exercisable in equal installments over a three-year period from the date of
grant.  The CGNC and CLC have discretion to accelerate the
exercisability of the options, except that the exercisability of an option
issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless the individual remains
employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the date of
grant.  All options expire no later than ten years from the grant
date.  The options become exercisable immediately if control of PPL
changes, as defined by the Plans.

PPL
received cash from stock option exercises during 2008 of $19
million.

The
estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.  PPL uses historical volatility and exercise
behavior to value its stock options.  Volatility over the expected
term of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that
may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted
PPL's volatility in those prior periods.  Management's expectations
for future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL's business model and
other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data
to determine the final volatility assumption.  The weighted-average
assumptions used in the model were:

      million.

(c)

Net
      of an income tax benefit of $2 million for each
  year.

The
income tax benefit PPL realized from stock-based arrangements for 2008 was $9
million, with $5 million attributed to stock option exercises.

Directors Stock Units

(PPL)

Under the
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, a mandatory amount of the cash retainers
of the members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of PPL is
deferred into stock units.  Such deferred stock units represent the
number of shares of PPL's common stock to which the board members are entitled
after they cease serving as a member of the Board of Directors.  Board
members are entitled to defer any or all of their fees and cash retainers that
are not part of the mandatory deferral into stock units.  The stock
unit accounts of each board member are increased based on dividends paid or
other distributions on PPL's common stock.  There were 359,864 such
stock units outstanding at December 31, 2008, which were accounted for as
liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings based on
PPL's common stock price at the end of each reporting period.

Stock
Appreciation Rights

(PPL and PPL Energy

WPD uses
stock appreciation rights to compensate senior management
employees.  Stock appreciation rights are granted with a reference
price to PPL's common stock at the date of grant.  These awards vest
over a three-year period and have a 10-year term, during which time employees
are entitled to receive a cash payment of any appreciation in the price of PPL's
common stock over the grant date fair value.  At December 31,
2008, there were 322,950 stock appreciation rights outstanding, which are
accounted for as liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in
earnings based on updated Black-Scholes calculations.

Compensation
credits related to stock appreciation rights in 2008 were $2 million, with
related income tax expense of $1 million.  Compensation costs related
to stock appreciation rights in 2007 were $5 million, with related income tax
benefits of $2 million.  Compensation costs and related income tax
benefits for 2006 were insignificant.

Awards
paid in 2008 and 2007 were each $2 million, and were insignificant for
2006.

Retirement and Postemployment Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Defined
Benefits

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit plans.

The
majority of PPL's domestic employees are eligible for pension benefits under
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of
service and final average pay, as defined by the plans.  Certain
employees may also be eligible for pension enhancements in the form of special
termination benefits under PPL's separation plan.  See "Separation
Benefits" below for additional information regarding PPL's separation
plan.

Employees
of PPL Montana are eligible for pension benefits under a cash balance pension
plan and employees of certain of PPL's mechanical contracting companies are
eligible for benefits under multi-employer plans sponsored by various
unions.  The employees of WPD are eligible for pension benefits under
a defined benefit pension plan with benefits based on length of service and
final average pay.

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to
directors, executives and other key management employees through unfunded
nonqualified retirement plans.

The
majority of employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries will become eligible for
certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through
contributory plans.  Postretirement benefits under the PPL Retiree
Health Plan are paid from funded VEBA trusts sponsored by PPL Services and a
401(h) account established within the PPL Services pension master trust by the
respective companies.  Postretirement benefits under the PPL Montana
Retiree Health Plan are paid from company assets.  WPD does not
sponsor any postretirement benefit plans other than pensions.

The
      $6 million domestic and $3 million WPD costs of termination benefits for
      2007 were related primarily to the elimination of positions at PPL's

      million was also recorded for a total charge of $5 million ($4 million
      after tax).

Prior
service costs for PPL Energy Supply of $4 million and actuarial loss of $2
million related to the WPD pension plans are expected to be amortized from AOCI
into net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal period.

Net
periodic defined benefit costs (credits) charged to operating expense, excluding
amounts charged to construction and other non-expense accounts,
were:

(a)

In
      addition to the specific plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL
      Supply and its subsidiaries were also allocated $32 million of the
      costs of defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services, included in the
      total cost above, based on their participation in those
    plans.

(b)

PPL
      Electric does not directly sponsor any defined benefit
      plans.  PPL Electric was allocated these costs of defined
      benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services, based on its participation in
      those plans.

The

postretirement benefit obligations of $15 million and $16 million and no fair
value of assets.

In
addition to the plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Energy Supply and its
subsidiaries are allocated a portion of the funded status and costs of the
defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services based on their participation in
those plans.  PPL Energy Supply's allocated share of the funded status
of the pension plans resulted in a liability of $229 million and $20 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007.  PPL Energy Supply's allocated share of
other postretirement benefits was a liability of $69 million and $93 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007.

PPL
Energy Supply's subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business make
contributions to various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans,
depending on an employee's status.  Contributions in both 2008 and
2007 were $61 million and in 2006 were $48 million.  The change in
contributions in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily the result of the changes
in the workforce at the mechanical contracting companies.  The
contribution rates have also increased from year to year.

(PPL
Electric)

Although
PPL Electric does not directly sponsor any defined benefit plans, it is
allocated a portion of the funded status and costs of plans sponsored by PPL
Services based on its participation in those plans.  PPL Electric's
allocated share of the funded status of the pension plans resulted in a
liability of $209 million at December 31, 2008.  PPL Electric's
allocated share of the funded status of the pension plans resulted in a deferred
asset of $12 million and a liability of $4 million at December 31,
2007.  The balance for PPL Electric's allocated share of other
postretirement benefits was a liability of $69 million at December 31, 2008
and a liability of $91 million at December 31, 2007.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric maintains a liability for the cost of health care of retired miners of
former subsidiaries that had been engaged in coal mining, as required by the
Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.  PPL Electric
accounts for this liability under EITF 92-13.  In 2006, PPL Electric
was able to fully offset the net liability, calculated at that time, of $36
million, with excess Black Lung Trust assets as a result of the passage of the
Pension Protection Act of 2006.  At December 31, 2008, the net
liability continues to be fully offset with excess Black Lung Trust
assets.  See "Pension Protection Act of 2006" within this note for
further discussion.

The
domestic pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers and are
rebalanced as necessary to maintain the target asset allocation
ranges.  PPL's investment strategy with respect to the domestic
pension assets is to achieve a satisfactory risk-adjusted return on assets that,
in combination with PPL's funding policy and tolerance for return volatility,
will ensure that sufficient dollars are available to provide benefit
payments.

The
target asset allocation was revised based on a risk-reduction strategy that was
approved by PPL's Employee Benefit Plan Board in March 2008.  The
strategy is not expected to be fully implemented until the end of
2009.

The
expected long-term rate of return for PPL's domestic pension plans considers the
plans' historical experience, but is primarily based on the plans' mix of assets
and expectations for long-term returns of those asset classes.

PPL's
investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations
is to fund the VEBA trusts and a 401(h) account with voluntary contributions and
to invest in a tax efficient manner utilizing a prudent mix of
assets.  Based on the current VEBA and postretirement plan structure,
PPL targets an asset allocation range of 40% to 50% equity and 30% to 40% debt,
with any difference held in cash as a result of contribution/investment timing
and payment of postretirement benefits.

The
expected long-term rate of return for PPL's other postretirement benefit plans
is based on

the
VEBA trusts' and a 401(h) account mix of assets and expectations for long-term
returns of those asset classes considering that a portion of those assets are
taxable.

In
consultation with its investment advisor and with WPD, the group trustees of the
WPD Group of the ESPS have drawn up a Statement of Investment Principles to
comply with the requirements of U.K. legislation.

The group
trustees' primary investment objective is to maximize investment returns within
the constraint of avoiding excessive volatility in the funding
position.

The
expected rate of return for WPD's pension plans considers that a portfolio
largely invested in equities would be expected to achieve an average rate of
return in excess of a portfolio largely invested in long-term
bonds.  The historical experience has been an excess return of 2% to
4% per annum on average over the return on long-term bonds.

Expected
Cash Flows - Domestic Defined Benefit Plans

(PPL)

There are
no contributions required for PPL's primary domestic pension plan or any of
PPL's other domestic subsidiary pension plans.  However, PPL's
domestic subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $41 million to their
pension plans in 2009 to ensure future compliance with minimum funding
requirements.

PPL does
not expect significant changes to its funding requirements in the near term as a
result of the economic downturn.  The funding valuation date for PPL's
primary domestic pension plan is based on a fiscal year beginning July
1.  As of July 1, 2008, this plan was overfunded and PPL was not
required to make contributions.  The next funding measurement date to
determine contributions that would be required in 2010 will be July 1,
2009.  PPL has accumulated significant credit balances by contributing
more than its required minimum contributions in prior years, which are expected
to offset any increased funding requirements until 2011 or later.  In
addition, approximately 40% of PPL's primary domestic pension plan expense is
allocated to PPL Electric and has been recoverable in rates.

PPL
sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets
are segregated from corporate assets.  PPL expects to make
approximately $4 million of benefit payments under these plans in
2009.

PPL is
not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but
has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement
benefit costs recognized.  Continuation of this past practice would
cause PPL to contribute $35 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
2009.

The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid and the following federal subsidy payments
are expected to be received by the separate plan trusts.

Expected Cash Flows - WPD Pension
Plans

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The
pension plans of WPD are subject to formal actuarial valuations every three
years, which are used to determine funding requirements.  Future
contributions were evaluated in accordance with the latest valuation performed
as of March 31, 2007, in respect of WPD's principal pension scheme, the
ESPS, to determine contribution requirements for 2009 and
forward.  WPD expects to make contributions of approximately $92
million in 2009.

PPL does
not expect significant changes to its funding requirements in the near term as a
result of the economic downturn.  The next funding valuation will
occur in 2010 to determine funding requirements for 2011 and
forward.  The funding requirements will be evaluated based on the
funded status of the plan at that time.  In addition, WPD is currently
permitted to recover approximately 65% of its deficit funding requirements in
rates for its main pension plan.

The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid by the separate plan trusts.

Employee
Stock Ownership Plan

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL

PPL
sponsors a non-leveraged ESOP in which substantially all domestic employees,
excluding those of PPL Montana and the mechanical contractors, are enrolled on
the first day of the month following eligible employee
status.  Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as ordinary
dividends by PPL.  Under existing income tax laws, PPL is permitted to
deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute
the resulting tax savings (dividend-based contribution) to the
ESOP.

The
dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of PPL's common stock and is
expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal
income tax purposes.  Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to
eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares
held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants'
compensation.

Compensation
expense for ESOP contributions was $7 million in 2008, 2007 and
2006.  These amounts were offset by the dividend-based contribution
tax savings and had no impact on PPL's earnings.

ESOP
shares outstanding at December 31, 2008, were 7,689,593 or 2% of total common
shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations.

Postemployment
Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Certain
PPL subsidiaries provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled
employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased
employees.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 112 when accounting for
these benefits.  Postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses
were not significant for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Separation
Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Certain
PPL subsidiaries also provide separation benefits to eligible
employees.  These benefits may be provided in the case of separations
due to performance issues, loss of job related qualifications or organizational
changes.  Certain employees separated are eligible for cash severance
payments, outplacement services, accelerated stock award vesting, continuation
of group health and welfare coverage, and enhanced pension and postretirement
medical benefits.  The type and amount of benefits provided is based
upon age, years of service and the nature of the
separation.  Separation benefits are recorded when such amounts are
probable and estimable.

Separation
benefits were not significant in 2008.

Separation
benefits recorded in 2007 were related to the elimination of positions at PPL's
Martins Creek plant due to the shutdown of two coal-fired units and the closing
of WPD's meter test station.  Total costs recorded were $13 million
($9 million after tax).  These costs included $4 million of cash
severance payments and enhanced pension benefits of $6 million under the PPL
domestic pension plan and $3 million under the WPD pension plan.  See
"Defined Benefits" above.

Separation
benefits recorded in 2006 were related to a staff reduction plan at PPL
Susquehanna and totaled $5 million ($3 million after tax).  These
costs included $2 million of cash severance payments and $3 million of enhanced
pension benefits under the PPL domestic pension plan.  See "Defined
Benefits" above.

Pension
Protection Act of 2006

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On August
17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was signed by the
President.  The Act's changes, which became effective in 2008, cover
current pension plan legislation and funding rules for defined benefit pension
plans.  Based on the current funded status of PPL's defined benefit
pension plans, the Act is not expected to have a significant impact on the
future funding of these plans or have a significant financial impact on PPL, PPL
Energy Supply or PPL Electric in regard to these plans.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

The Act
does contain a provision that provides for excess assets held exclusively in
Black Lung Trust funds to be used to pay for health benefits other than black
lung disease for retired coal miners.  Prior to recognition of this
provision of the Act, PPL Electric had a net liability of $36 million for the
medical costs of retirees of a PPL subsidiary represented by the United Mine
Workers of America (UMWA).  This subsidiary had a Black Lung Trust
that was significantly overfunded.  As a result of the Act and the
ability to use the excess Black Lung Trust assets to make future benefit
payments for the UMWA retiree medical costs, PPL Electric was able to fully
offset the UMWA retiree medical liability on its Balance Sheet and record a
one-time credit to PPL's and PPL Electric's "Other operation and maintenance"
expense of $21 million (net of tax expense of $15 million) in 2006.

Jointly-Owned Facilities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, subsidiaries of PPL and PPL Energy Supply owned
interests in the facilities listed below.  The Balance Sheets of PPL
and PPL Energy Supply include the amounts noted in the following
table.

Each PPL
Generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the
facility.  Each receives a portion of the total output of the
generating stations equal to its percentage ownership.  The share of
fuel and other operating costs associated with the stations is included in the
corresponding operating expenses on the Statements of Income.

In
addition to the interests mentioned above, PPL Montana is the operator of the
jointly-owned, coal-fired generating units comprising the Colstrip steam
generation facility.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, PPL Montana
had a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% leasehold
interest in Colstrip Unit 3 under operating leases.  See Note 11 for
additional information.

PPL
Montana's share of direct expenses associated with the operation and maintenance
of these facilities is included in the corresponding operating expenses on the
Statements of Income.  Each joint-owner in these facilities provides
its own financing.  As operator of all Colstrip Units, PPL Montana
invoices each joint-owner for its respective portion of the direct
expenses.  The amount due from joint-owners was $15 million and $10
million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, NorthWestern owned a 30% leasehold interest in
Colstrip Unit 4.  PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing
agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of
Colstrip Units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the
respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular
cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4.  However, each party is
responsible for its own fuel-related costs.

Commitments and Contingencies

Energy
Purchases, Energy Sales and Other Commitments

Energy Purchase
Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into long-term purchase contracts to supply the fuel
requirements for generation facilities.  These contracts include
commitments to purchase coal, emission allowances, limestone, natural gas, oil
and nuclear fuel and extend for terms through 2019.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply also enter into long-term contracts for the storage and
transportation of natural gas.  The long-term natural gas storage
contracts extend for terms through 2011 and the long-term natural gas
transportation contracts extend for terms through 2032.  Additionally,
PPL and PPL Energy Supply have entered into long-term contracts to purchase
power that extend for terms through 2017, excluding long-term power purchase
agreements for the full output of two wind farms.  These wind farm
contracts extend for terms through 2027.

As part
of the purchase of generation assets from Montana Power, PPL Montana assumed a
power purchase agreement, which was still in effect at December 31,
2008.  In accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, PPL Montana
recorded a liability of $58 million as the estimated fair value of the agreement
at the acquisition date.  The liability is being reduced over the term
of the agreement, through 2010, as an adjustment to "Energy purchases" on the
Statements of Income.  The unamortized balance of the liability
related to the agreement at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $24 million and $34
million, of which $11 million and $24 million is included in "Deferred Credits
and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" and $13 million and $10 million is
included in "Current Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheets.

In 1998,
PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual for above-market contracts with NUGs of
$879 million, due to the deregulation of its generation
business.  Effective January 1999, PPL Electric began reducing this
liability as an offset to "Energy purchases" on the Statements of
Income.  This reduction is based on the estimated timing of the
purchases from the NUGs and projected market prices for this
generation.  The final NUG contract expires in 2014.  In
connection with PPL's corporate realignment in 2000, the remaining balance of
this liability was transferred to PPL EnergyPlus.  At December 31,
2008 and 2007, the remaining liability associated with the above-market NUG
contracts was $29 million and $71 million.

In June
2008, PPL EnergyPlus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing
long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of
Ironwood.  Under the agreement, PPL EnergyPlus has control over the
plant's dispatch into the electricity grid and supplies the natural gas
necessary to operate the plant.  The tolling agreement extends through
2021.  See Notes 11 and 21 for additional information.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In 2007,
PPL Electric began to conduct competitive solicitations to purchase electricity
generation supply in 2010, after its existing PLR contract expires, for
customers who do not choose a competitive supplier.  A total of six
auctions are planned, with two occurring in each of the years 2007, 2008 and
2009.  Each solicitation is for 850 MW of expected generation
supply.  Average generation supply prices (per MWh), including
Pennsylvania gross receipts tax and an adjustment for line losses, for the first
four solicitations were as follows:

In August
2008, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to approve its plan to purchase
the PLR electricity supply that PPL Electric will need for 2011 through
mid-2014.  Under the plan, PPL Electric proposed to buy this
electricity for January 2011 through May 2014 four times a year, beginning in
the third quarter of 2009, for 12- and 24- month periods.  PPL
Electric also would seek bids from other companies to manage its hourly
purchases in the competitive electricity market.  For residential and
small-business customers, 90% of the supply would be acquired through
fixed-price contracts of 12 or 24 months, and 10% through hourly purchases in
the open market.  All of the power for large commercial and industrial
customers would be purchased on an hourly basis in the open
market.  An independent third party would administer the process of
securing power supply contracts and, with PUC oversight, select the suppliers
that would provide generation supply at the lowest cost to PPL Electric's
customers.

In
November 2008, PPL Electric proposed several amendments to its plan to reflect
passage of Pennsylvania Act 129 (Act 129).  Act 129, among other
things, creates an energy efficiency and conservation program.  PPL
Electric added provisions to purchase 5% of its default service supply through
five-year contracts and an additional 5% through ten-year
contracts.  It reduced the term of its plan by one year, proposing
that the plan end in May 2013, rather than in May 2014.  Finally, PPL
Electric provided support for several findings that the PUC was required to make
under Act 129.  PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this
matter.

See Note
16 for additional information on PPL Electric's existing PLR contracts with PPL
EnergyPlus and the bids awarded to PPL EnergyPlus under PPL Electric's Supply
Master Agreement for 2010.

Energy Sales
Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
connection with its marketing activities or associated with certain of its power
plants, PPL Energy Supply has entered into long-term power sales contracts that
extend for terms through 2016, excluding an insignificant contract extending
through 2023.  All long-term contracts were executed at prices that
approximated market prices at the time of execution.

PPL
Energy Supply has entered into full-requirement and retail contracts with
various counterparties.  These contracts extend through
2014.  Under these contracts, if PPL Energy Supply's credit rating
falls below investment grade or PPL Energy Supply's contract exposure exceeds
the established credit limit for the contract, the counterparty has the right to
request collateral from PPL Energy Supply.

PPL Montana Hydroelectric
License Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
Montana has 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed by
the FERC under long-term licenses pursuant to the Federal Power
Act.  Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Federal Power Act, the FERC
approved the transfer from Montana Power to PPL Montana of all pertinent
licenses and any amendments in connection with the Montana Asset Purchase
Agreement.

The Kerr
Dam Project license was jointly issued by the FERC to Montana Power and the
Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation in 1985, and
required Montana Power to hold and operate the project for 30
years.  The license required Montana Power, and subsequently PPL
Montana as a result of the purchase of the Kerr Dam from Montana Power, to
continue to implement a plan to mitigate the impact of the Kerr Dam on fish,
wildlife and the habitat.  Under this arrangement, PPL Montana has a
remaining commitment to spend $14 million between 2009 and 2015, in addition to
the annual rental it pays to the tribes.  Between 2015 and 2025, the
tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project for the
remainder of the license term, which expires in 2035.

PPL
Montana entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with state, federal
and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the FERC renewal license
for the nine dams for the Missouri-Madison project.  The MOUs require
PPL Montana to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish,
wildlife and the habitat, and to increase recreational
opportunities.  The MOUs were created to maximize collaboration
between the parties and enhance the possibility to receive matching funds from
relevant federal agencies.  Under this arrangement, PPL Montana has a
remaining commitment to spend $38 million between 2009 and 2040.

Montana Power Shareholders'
Litigation

In August
2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders of
Montana Power against Montana Power, the directors of Montana Power, certain
advisors and consultants of Montana Power, and PPL Montana.  The
plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Montana Power failed to obtain
shareholder approval for the sale of Montana Power's generation assets to PPL
Montana in 1999, and that the sale "was null and void ab
initio."  Among the remedies that the plaintiffs are seeking is the
establishment of a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation
assets and all profits earned by PPL Montana from the generation assets, plus
interest on the amounts subject to the trust.  This lawsuit is pending
in the U.S. District Court of Montana, Butte Division, and the judge placed this
proceeding on hold pending the outcome of certain motions currently before the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the resolution of which may
impact this proceeding.  The judge in this case has not established a
schedule to resume the proceeding.  In September 2007, certain
plaintiffs proposed a settlement of certain claims not involving PPL and
proposed a status conference to discuss their proposal.  The judge
held a status conference in January 2008 and rejected the proposed
settlement.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of
this matter.

Montana Hydroelectric
Litigation

In
November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation (Avista) and PacifiCorp commenced
an action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court
seeking a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for their
hydroelectric facilities' use and occupancy of streambeds in Montana can be
collected by the State of Montana.  This request was brought following
the dismissal of the State of Montana's federal lawsuit seeking such payments or
compensation in the U.S. District Court of Montana, Missoula Division, on
jurisdictional grounds.  The State's federal lawsuit was founded on
allegations that the beds of Montana's navigable rivers became state-owned trust
property upon Montana's admission to statehood, and that the use of them for
placement of dam structures, affiliated structures and reservoirs should, under
a 1931 regulatory scheme enacted after all but one of the dams in question were
constructed, trigger lease payments for use of land beneath.  In July
2006, the Montana state court approved a stipulation by the State of Montana
that it is not seeking lease payments or other compensation from PPL Montana for
the period prior to PPL Montana's acquisition of the hydroelectric facilities in
December 1999.

In June
and October 2007, Pacificorp and Avista, respectively, entered into settlement
agreements with the State of Montana providing, in pertinent part, that each
company would make prospective lease payments of $50,000 and $4 million per year
for use of the State's navigable streambed (adjusted annually for inflation and
subject to other future adjustments).  Under these settlement
agreements, the future annual payments resolved the State's claims for both past
and future compensation.

In the
October 2007 trial of this matter, the State of Montana asserted that PPL
Montana should make a prospective lease payment for use of the State's
streambeds of $6 million per year (adjusted annually for inflation) and a
retroactive payment of compensation for the 2000-2006 period (including
interest) of $41 million.  PPL Montana vigorously contested both such
assertions.

In June
2008, the District Court issued a decision awarding compensation of
approximately $34 million for prior years and approximately $6 million for 2007
compensation.  The Court also deferred the determination of
compensation for 2008 and future years to the Montana State Land
Board.

PPL
Montana believes that the District Court's decision and a number of its pretrial
rulings are erroneous.  In October 2008, PPL Montana filed an appeal
of the decision to the Montana Supreme Court and a stay of judgment, including a
stay of the Land Board's authority to assess compensation against PPL Montana
for 2008 and future periods.

PPL
Montana timely filed its opening appellate brief in February
2009.

PPL
Montana believes it is reasonably possible that a liability for prior use and
occupancy of certain Montana streambeds may ultimately be incurred for the
periods 2000 through 2006, and the amount awarded by the District Court
represents the maximum exposure.  PPL Montana has not recorded a loss
accrual for this portion of the State's claim.

For 2007
and subsequent years, PPL Montana believes it is probable that its hydroelectric
projects will be subject to annual estimated compensation ranging from $300,000
to $6 million.  Given that there was no single amount within that
range more likely than any other, PPL Montana is annually accruing
$300,000.

PPL
Montana will continue to assess the loss exposure for the Montana hydroelectric
litigation in future periods.

Regulatory
Issues

Pennsylvania
Activities

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In May
2007, the PUC approved final regulations regarding the obligation of
Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond.  The regulations provide that default service providers
will acquire electricity supply at prevailing market prices pursuant to
procurement and implementation plans approved by the PUC.  The
regulations also address the utilities' recovery of electricity supply
costs.  The final regulations became effective in September
2007.  See "Energy Purchase Commitments" for details of PPL Electric's
competitive solicitations under the PUC regulations.

In June
2008, the Pennsylvania General Assembly (General Assembly) passed, and the
Governor signed, a bill that would create a $650 million fund for clean energy
projects, conservation and energy efficiency initiatives and pollution control
projects to be funded through revenue bonds and gross receipts tax revenue,
which will increase as rate caps expire.

For the
past few years, PPL and PPL Electric have been working with Pennsylvania
legislators, regulators and other stakeholders to develop constructive measures
to help customers transition to market rates after 2009, including a variety of
rate mitigation, educational and energy conservation programs, consistent with
several initiatives being developed by the state administration and
legislature.  In this regard, in November 2007, PPL Electric requested
the PUC to approve a plan under which its residential and small commercial
customers could phase-in the impact of price increases when generation rate caps
expire in 2010.  The proposed phase-in plan provided that customers
could pay additional amounts on their electric bills beginning in mid-2008 and
continuing through 2009, and such additional amounts, plus accrued interest,
would be applied to their 2010 and 2011 electric bills, mitigating the impact of
the rate cap expiration.  The phase-in plan is available on an
"opt-in" basis (i.e., customers would have to affirmatively enroll) and is
available to customers enrolled in budget billing.  After approval by
the PUC, the program was implemented in October 2008.

In
February 2009, PPL Electric asked the PUC for permission to offer customers a
second option for reducing the potential initial impact of higher electricity
prices resulting from expiration of the generation rate caps.  If
approved by the PUC, this option would enable eligible residential and eligible
small-business customers to defer payment of any increase greater than 25% in
their 2010 electric bills.  The 25% will be calculated on an average
rate schedule usage basis, and will be based on a comparison of currently
estimated 2009 bills to currently estimated 2010 bills.

Deferred
amounts, plus interest of 6%, would be repaid by customers over a one- or
two-year period, depending on their level of electricity use.  All
deferrals would be repaid by the end of 2012.  Like the phase-in plan,
the deferral option would be available on an "opt-in" basis.  Pending
PUC approval of this option, customers will be invited to enroll by December 15,
2009.

Also, the
General Assembly passed and the Governor signed into law Act 129 in October
2008.  The law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program
and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new PLR electricity supply
procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to
the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard.

Under Act
129, Electric Delivery Companies (EDCs) must develop and file an energy
efficiency and conservation plan with the PUC.  EDCs must contract
with a conservation service provider to implement all or a portion of the
plan.  Act 129 requires reduction in consumption of 1% by 2011 and 3%
by 2013, and a reduction in peak demand of 4.5% by 2013.  EDCs will be
able to recover the costs of implementing an energy efficiency conservation
plan.  These costs are capped at 2% of the EDC's annual revenue at
December 31, 2006.

Act 129
also requires installation of smart meters under the following
conditions:  for new construction, upon the request of consumers at
their cost, or on a depreciation schedule not exceeding 15 years.  PPL
Electric's current advanced metering technology generally meets the definition
of smart metering technology in Act 129 and does not need to be
replaced.  Under Act 129, EDCs will be able to recover the costs of
providing smart metering technology.

Act 129
also requires the default service provider (DSP) to provide electric generation
supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved competitive procurement
plan through auctions, requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole
discretion of the DSP.  Act 129 requires a mix of spot market
purchases, short-term contracts and long-term contracts (4 to 20 years, with
long-term contracts limited to up to 25% of the load unless otherwise approved
by the PUC).  The DSP will be able to recover the costs associated
with a competitive procurement plan.

Under Act
129, the DSP competitive procurement plan must also ensure adequate and reliable
service "at least cost" over time.  Act 129 also grants the PUC
authority to extend long-term power contracts up to 20 years, if necessary, to
achieve the "least cost" standard.

Act 129
also provides for market misconduct corrective actions.  In the event
that an EDC, its affiliate or a supplier from whom the EDC has purchased power,
is found guilty of market manipulation, the PUC can direct an EDC to take any
and all reasonable action to quantify the effect of the market misconduct on
Pennsylvania ratepayers and seek recompense.

Act 129
also makes changes to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards by adding
Pennsylvania biomass energy and small hydroelectric plants as Tier 1 alternative
energy sources and requiring the PUC automatically to increase the Tier 1
requirements to account for increases in the additional resources.

Act 129
also requires the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
to complete a study to identify suitable geological formations for the location
of a state carbon sequestration network.

Act 129
does not address rate mitigation.  The Governor, in his February 2009
budget address, called for a mandatory phase-in of electricity price increases
over a three or four year period beginning when rate caps expire.  The
phase-in for PPL Electric will begin in 2010.

In the
last legislative session, certain Pennsylvania legislators introduced
legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery
through rates for Pennsylvania utilities beyond their transition periods, which
in PPL Electric's case would be December 31, 2009.  PPL and PPL
Electric have expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential
consequences of such legislation on customer service, system reliability,
adequate future generation supply and PPL Electric's financial
viability.  It is possible that similar legislation could be
reintroduced.  If such legislation or similar legislation were
introduced and ultimately enacted, PPL Electric could experience substantial
operating losses, cash flow shortfalls and other adverse financial
impacts.  In addition, continuing uncertainty concerning PPL
Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operation
after 2009 could adversely impact its credit quality, financing costs and
availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its
business.  PPL and PPL Electric believe that such an extension of rate
caps, if enacted into law, would violate federal law and the U.S.
Constitution.  At this time, PPL and PPL Electric cannot predict the
final outcome or impact of this legislative and regulatory
process.

FERC Transmission
Rates

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In August
2008, PPL Electric asked the FERC for a change in the way transmission rates are
calculated to support continued investment in its transmission system by
switching to formula-based rates.  Under formula-based rates, a fixed
earnings level is set for the utility, and the utility annually adjusts its
transmission rates, subject to FERC review.  The process offered an
opportunity for public input.  The proposed rate design would ensure
that there is no over-recovery or under-recovery of the actual costs of
providing transmission delivery service.  The rate change request, if
approved, would result in a monthly increase of $0.74 for an average PPL
Electric residential customer.  PPL Electric requested that the
proposed rate take effect November 1, 2008.  This request would
not affect generation charges or distribution rates.

In
October 2008, the FERC accepted the proposed rate for filing, effective November
1, 2008, subject to refund.  The FERC did not adjust the requested
return on equity of 12.84%, which included 50 basis points for membership in
PJM.  Finally, the FERC set the matter for hearing, but held the
hearings in abeyance to provide time to establish settlement judge
procedures.  Settlement discussions are now underway among PPL
Electric, FERC staff and several intervening parties.  PPL Electric
cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

California ISO and Western
Markets

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Through
its subsidiaries, PPL made $18 million of sales to the California ISO during the
period October 2000 through June 2001, of which $17 million has not been paid to
PPL subsidiaries.  Given the myriad of electricity supply problems
faced by the California electric utilities and the California ISO, PPL cannot
predict whether or when it will receive payment.  At December 31,
2008, PPL continues to be fully reserved for underrecoveries of payments for
these sales.

Regulatory
proceedings arising out of the California electricity supply situation have been
filed at the FERC.  The FERC has determined that all sellers of energy
into markets operated by the California ISO and the California Power Exchange,
including PPL Montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period
beginning October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, but the FERC has not yet ruled
on the exact amounts that the sellers, including PPL Montana, would be required
to refund.  In decisions in September 2004 and August 2006, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the FERC had the additional
legal authority to order refunds for periods prior to October 2, 2000, and
ordered the FERC to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to grant
such additional refunds.  In February 2008, the FERC initiated
proceedings to determine whether it would be appropriate to grant additional
refunds.  The FERC also instituted settlement proceedings to explore
whether a settlement is possible.

In June
2003, the FERC took several actions as a result of a number of related
investigations.  The FERC terminated proceedings to consider whether
to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the Pacific Northwest,
including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period December 2000 through
June 2001.  In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed the FERC's decision and ordered the FERC to consider additional
evidence.  The FERC also commenced additional investigations relating
to "gaming" and bidding practices during 2000 and 2001, but neither PPL
EnergyPlus nor PPL Montana believes it is a subject of these
investigations.

In
February 2004, the Montana Public Service Commission initiated a limited
investigation of the Montana retail electricity market for the years 2000 and
2001, focusing on how that market was affected by transactions involving the
possible manipulation of the electricity grid in the western U.S.  The
investigation includes all public utilities and licensed electricity suppliers
in Montana, including PPL Montana, as well as other entities that may possess
relevant information.  In June 2004, the Montana Attorney General
served PPL Montana and more than 20 other companies with subpoenas requesting
documents, and PPL Montana has provided responsive documents to the Montana
Attorney General.

While PPL
and its subsidiaries believe that they have not engaged in any improper trading
or marketing practices affecting the California and western markets, PPL cannot
predict the outcome of the above-described investigations, lawsuits and
proceedings or whether any PPL subsidiaries will be the target of any additional
governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund
proceedings.

PJM
RPM Litigation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In May
2008, a group of state public utility commissions, state consumer advocates,
municipal entities and electric cooperatives, industrial end-use customers and a
single electric distribution company (collectively, the RPM Buyers) filed a
complaint before the FERC objecting to the prices for capacity under the PJM
Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) that were set in the 2008-09, 2009-10 and
2010-11 RPM base residual auctions.  The RPM Buyers request that the
FERC reset the rates paid to generators for capacity in those periods to a
significantly lower level.  Thus, the complaint requests that
generators be paid less for those periods through refunds and/or prospective
changes in rates.  The relief requested in the complaint, if granted,
could have a material effect on PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric.  PJM, PPL and numerous other parties have responded to the
complaint, strongly opposing the relief sought by the RPM Buyers.  In
September 2008, the FERC entered an order denying the complaint.  PPL
cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

In
December 2008, the PJM submitted amendments to certain provisions governing its
RPM capacity market.  The amendments were intended to permit the
compensation available to suppliers that provide capacity, like PPL Energy
Supply, to increase.  The PJM sought approval of the amendments in
time for them to be implemented for the next capacity auction that will occur in
May 2009 (for service in June 2012 through May 2013).  Numerous
parties, including PPL, protested the PJM's filing.  Certain of the
protesting parties proposed changes to the capacity market auction that would
result in a reduction in compensation to capacity suppliers.  The
changes proposed by the PJM and by other parties in response to the PJM
proposals could significantly affect the compensation available to suppliers of
capacity participating in future RPM auctions.  PPL cannot predict the
outcome of this proceeding.

FERC Market-Based Rate
Authority

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
December 1998, the FERC issued an order authorizing PPL EnergyPlus to make
wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based
rates.  In that order, the FERC directed PPL EnergyPlus to file an
updated market analysis within three years of the date of the order, and every
three years thereafter.  Market-based rate filings with the FERC were
made in November 2004 by PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of
PPL Generation's subsidiaries.  These filings consisted of a Western
market-based rate filing for PPL Montana and an Eastern market-based rate filing
for most of the other PPL subsidiaries in the PJM region.

In
September 2005, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the Eastern
market-based rate filing, subject to PPL subsidiaries making a compliance filing
providing further support that they cannot erect other non-transmission barriers
to entry into the generation market.  The PPL subsidiaries made this
compliance filing in October 2005, which the FERC accepted.

In May
2006, the FERC issued an order rejecting the claims of the various parties in
the proceeding regarding PPL's Western market-based rate filing and granting PPL
Montana market-based rate authority in NorthWestern's control
area.  In July 2007, the FERC denied two outstanding requests for
rehearing of its 2006 order.  Subsequently, various parties in this
proceeding filed appeals of the order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit.  In September 2007, a party also filed a complaint with
the FERC seeking additional refunds in the event that the U.S. Court of Appeals
overturns or reverses the FERC order.  While PPL Montana continues to
believe that it does not have market power in NorthWestern's control area and
that it has no obligations to make additional sales of power to NorthWestern
regardless of the outcome of this proceeding, it cannot predict the outcome of
these proceedings.

In
January 2008, pursuant to the schedule established by FERC orders, PPL's
subsidiaries made another market-based rate renewal filing for all Eastern
subsidiaries in the PJM, New England and New York regions, including PPL
Electric, PPL EnergyPlus and most of PPL Generation's
subsidiaries.  In October 2008, the FERC renewed these subsidiaries'
market-based rate authority as requested.

Currently,
if a seller is granted market-based rate authority by the FERC, it may enter
into power contracts during the time period for which such authority has been
granted.  If the FERC determines that the market is not workably
competitive or that the seller possesses market power or is not charging "just
and reasonable" rates, the FERC institutes prospective action.  Any
contracts entered into pursuant to the FERC's market-based rate authority remain
in effect and are generally subject to a high standard of review before the FERC
can order any changes.  Recent court decisions by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have raised issues that may make it more difficult
for the FERC to continue its program of promoting wholesale electricity
competition through market-based rate authority.  These court
decisions permit retroactive refunds and a lower standard of review by the FERC
for changing power contracts, and could have the effect of requiring the FERC to
review in advance most, if not all, power contracts.  In June 2008,
the U.S. Supreme Court reversed one of the decisions of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, thus upholding the higher standard of review for
modifying contracts.  The FERC has not yet taken action in response to
these recent court decisions.  At this time, PPL cannot predict the
impact of these court decisions on the FERC's future market-based rate authority
program or on PPL's business.

IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax
Credits

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL,
through its subsidiaries, had interests in two former synthetic fuel production
facilities:  the Somerset facility, which was located in Pennsylvania
and the Tyrone facility, which was located in Kentucky.  PPL had
received tax credits pursuant to Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code
based on the sale of synthetic fuel from these facilities.  The
Section 29/45K tax credit program expired at the end of 2007, and production of
synthetic fuel at these facilities and all other synthetic fuel operations
ceased as of December 31, 2007.  The facilities have been dismantled
and retired as of December 31, 2008.

PPL
performed impairment reviews of both its synthetic fuel production facilities
during 2006.  The reviews were prompted by the temporary suspension of
operations at Somerset in April 2006, the uncertainty surrounding the future
operations of each of the facilities and continued observed and forecasted high
crude oil prices at that time.  PPL determined that the net book value
of the facilities exceeded the projected undiscounted cash
flows.  Therefore, in 2006, PPL recorded charges totaling $10 million
($6 million after tax) to fully impair its synfuel-related assets based on an
internal model and other analysis.  The impairment charges were
reflected in "Energy-related businesses" expenses on the Statements of
Income.  The assets of the facilities were a component of the Supply
segment.

In April
2008, the IRS published the domestic first purchase price (DFPP) for the prior
year indicating that the DFPP reference price increased above PPL's estimated
price levels for 2007 and the inflation-adjusted phase-out range decreased from
PPL's estimate for 2007.  Therefore, PPL recorded an expense of $13
million ($0.04 per share, basic and diluted, for PPL) during 2008, to "Income
Taxes" on the Statement of Income to account for this
difference.

Energy Policy Act of 2005 -
Reliability Standards

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In August
2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Energy Act) was signed into
law.  The 2005 Energy Act is comprehensive legislation that
substantially affects the regulation of energy companies.  The Act
amends federal energy laws and provides the FERC with new oversight
responsibilities.  Among the important changes that have been
implemented under this legislation is the appointment of the NERC to
establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards)
regarding the bulk power system.  The FERC will oversee this process
and independently enforce the Reliability Standards.

The
Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain
users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility
companies, generators and marketers.  The FERC has indicated it
intends to enforce vigorously the Reliability Standards using, among other
means, civil penalty authority.  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC
may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, per violation, for
certain violations.  The first group of Reliability Standards approved
by the FERC became effective in June 2007.

In
September 2007, PPL Electric self-reported to the RFC that PPL Electric had
identified a potential violation of certain reliability requirements and
submitted an accompanying mitigation plan.  In February 2008, the RFC
notified PPL Electric that it had completed its investigation, accepted PPL
Electric's mitigation plan and issued a Notice of Alleged
Violation.  In September 2008, the RFC issued its Notice of Confirmed
Violation concerning this matter.  The RFC's determination is subject
to review and approval by the NERC and the FERC.  At this time, PPL
Electric cannot predict the outcome of these reviews.

U.K. Overhead Electricity
Networks

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In 2002,
the U.K. Government's Department of Trade and Industry issued guidance that low
voltage overhead electricity networks within three meters horizontal clearance
of a building should either be insulated or relocated.  This imposed a
retroactive requirement on existing assets that were built with lower
clearances.  In 2008, following extensive discussion, the Government's
safety body determined that the U.K. electricity network should comply with the
guidance issued.  WPD estimates that the cost of compliance will be
approximately $87 million and is expected to be allowed to be recovered through
rates.  Ofgem has determined that WPD (South Wales) should comply by
2015 and WPD (South West) by 2018.

Environmental
Matters - Domestic

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Due to
the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, PPL
subsidiaries may be required to modify, curtail, replace or cease operating
certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by
regulatory bodies or courts.  In this regard, PPL subsidiaries also
may incur capital expenditures or operating expenses in amounts which are not
now determinable, but could be significant.

Air

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

The Clean
Air Act deals, in part, with emissions causing acid deposition, attainment of
federal ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions and visibility
standards in the U.S.  Amendments to the Clean Air Act requiring additional
emission reductions are likely to continue to be proposed in the U.S.
Congress.  The Clean Air Act allows states to develop more stringent
regulations and in some instances, as discussed below, Pennsylvania and Montana
have chosen to do so.

Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR)

Citing
its authority under the Clean Air Act, in 1997, the EPA developed new standards
for ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the U.S.  To
facilitate attainment of these standards, the EPA promulgated the CAIR for 28
midwestern and eastern states, including Pennsylvania, to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions by about 50% by 2010 and to extend the current seasonal program for
reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions to a year-round program starting in
2009.  The CAIR required further reductions in the CAIR region,
starting in 2015, in sulfur dioxide of 30% from 2010 levels, and nitrogen oxides
during the ozone season of 17% from 2009 levels.  The CAIR allowed
these reductions to be achieved through cap-and-trade programs.

In July
2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the U.S. Circuit
Court) issued a ruling that invalidated CAIR in its entirety, including its
cap-and-trade program.  The U.S. Circuit Court did not overturn the
previously existing cap-and-trade program for sulfur dioxide reductions under
the acid rain program or the previously existing cap-and-trade program for
reductions in nitrogen oxides during the ozone season.

As a
result of this decision, in the third quarter of 2008, PPL determined that all
of the annual nitrogen oxide allowances PPL EnergyPlus had purchased pursuant to
CAIR were no longer required and had no value; therefore, an impairment charge
of $33 million pre-tax ($20 million after tax) was recorded.  Further,
PPL EnergyPlus recorded an additional charge and a corresponding reserve of $12
million pre-tax ($7 million after tax) related to certain put options it had
sold for annual nitrogen oxide allowances.  These charges, recorded in
PPL and PPL Energy Supply's Supply segment, are included in "Other operation and
maintenance" expense on the Statement of Income.  The U.S. Circuit
Court's decision did not impact PPL EnergyPlus's seasonal nitrogen oxide
allowances.  PPL is pursuing resolution of its rights and obligations
under its nitrogen oxide allowance option contracts that had delivery dates
after the U.S. Circuit Court's decision in July 2008 to void the CAIR
regulations, but prior to the same Court's decision in December 2008 that it
would not vacate the rule.

The U.S.
Circuit Court decision in December 2008 to remand CAIR back to the EPA without
vacating the rule has effectively temporarily reinstated CAIR resulting once
again in an annual-reduction requirement for nitrogen oxides and a market for
annual nitrogen oxide allowances.  PPL expects to meet the annual
nitrogen oxide reductions required by CAIR in 2009.  However, the
ultimate disposition of CAIR's cap-and-trade program and the value of annual
nitrogen oxide allowances remain uncertain.  If the EPA revises CAIR
to require more stringent emission reductions or revises CAIR to eliminate the
regional cap-and-trade program, the costs of compliance are not now
determinable, but could be significant.

Based on
the July 2008 U.S. Circuit Court decision, it was PPL EnergyPlus's position that
the change of law permitted PPL EnergyPlus to terminate certain option
contracts, because, among other things, it was not possible for the
counterparties to deliver the allowances required by those option contracts in
light of CAIR's invalidation.  In August 2008, PPL EnergyPlus filed a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
against one of the counterparties which had attempted to deliver annual nitrogen
oxides allowances despite the U.S. Circuit Court's ruling.  Another
counterparty, under a different option contract, which also attempted to deliver
annual nitrogen oxide allowances after the July 2008 U.S. Circuit Court
decision, but before the December 2008 ruling, filed a separate lawsuit against
PPL EnergyPlus, also in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York.  A third counterparty has asserted a claim, but has not
initiated litigation, under a similar put option contract.  All three
counterparties seek damages for PPL EnergyPlus's failure to take delivery of the
allowances.  It is unclear how the December 2008 U.S. Circuit Court
ruling will impact this litigation.  As a result of the December 2008
ruling and associated delivery of allowances under other option contracts not
currently in dispute, the reserve of $12 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax)
recorded in the third quarter of 2008 related to the put options was revised in
the fourth quarter of 2008 to $9 million pre-tax ($5 million after
tax).

The EPA
has recently tightened the ambient air quality standard for
ozone.  The more stringent standard could result in requirements to
reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides beyond those required under the
CAIR.  If additional reductions were to be required, the costs are not
now determinable, but could be significant.

To
continue meeting the sulfur dioxide reduction requirements under the acid rain
provisions of the Clean Air Act, and the reductions required by CAIR (remanded
by the U.S. Circuit Court but currently in place), PPL has installed scrubbers
at its Montour plant that are now in service.  PPL is continuing with
installation of scrubbers at its Brunner Island plant.  In addition,
with respect to compliance with annual and ozone season nitrogen
oxide reduction requirements, PPL's plan has been to operate the SCRs at
Montour Units 1 and 2, to optimize emission reductions from the existing
combustion controls and to purchase any needed emission allowances on the open
market.  PPL's current installation plan for the scrubbers and other
pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate and
nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction) reflects a
total cost of approximately $1.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion has already been
spent, the remainder of which is included in the 2009 through 2013 capital
budget.  PPL expects up to a 30 MW reduction in net generation
capability at the Brunner Island plant due to the estimated increase in station
service electrical usage during the scrubber operation.

Mercury

Also
citing its authority under the Clean Air Act, in May 2005, the EPA issued the
Clean Air Mercury Regulations (CAMR) that affect coal-fired
plants.  These regulations established a cap-and-trade program to take
effect in two phases, with a first phase to begin in January 2010, and a second
phase with more stringent requirements to begin in January
2018.  However, in February 2008, the U.S. Circuit Court overturned
the EPA's rule.  Under this decision, the EPA must either properly
remove mercury from regulation under the hazardous air pollutant provisions of
the Clean Air Act or develop standards requiring MACT for electric generating
units.  In January 2009, the EPA stated that it will proceed with
developing MACT standards for mercury emissions from electric generating
units.  The costs of complying with such standards are not now
determinable, but could be significant.

Pennsylvania
has adopted its own mercury rules that are more stringent than
CAMR.  Pennsylvania's rules establish mercury emission limits for each
coal-fired generating facility beginning in 2010, and require that mercury
emission allowances under the EPA's cap-and-trade program under CAMR be met at
each unit without the benefit of an emissions trading program, and that tighter
emission limits based on the second phase of the CAMR requirements be
accelerated to begin in 2015.  In light of the Court decision
overturning CAMR, in September 2008, PPL filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania
Commonwealth Court (Commonwealth Court) seeking to have the Pennsylvania mercury
rule rescinded on the basis that it is unlawful, invalid and unenforceable under
the provisions of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act.  In
January 2009, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court issued its ruling concluding
that the state mercury rule was unlawful, invalid and
unenforceable.  The Pennsylvania DEP has appealed this decision to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the Commonwealth Court decision has been
automatically stayed.  PPL has filed an application to lift the
stay.  Pending final resolution of this matter, PPL is evaluating its
mercury control plans and what steps it needs to take at this time.

Depending
on the outcome of the Pennsylvania mercury rule, PPL may need to have all of the
Brunner Island scrubbers in service by 2010 along with chemical injection
systems to achieve the Phase 1 mercury reduction requirements.  PPL
estimates that the capital cost of such chemical injection systems at Brunner
Island will be approximately $40 million.  For Montour, PPL plans to
operate the SCRs (already in place) year-round along with the scrubbers to
achieve compliance with Phase 1.  PPL is evaluating the mercury
reductions from these systems to determine whether further reductions are
needed.  If additional injection systems are required to assure
compliance, PPL estimates the cost of these systems to be approximately $32
million.

To meet
Pennsylvania's 2015 mercury reduction requirements, adsorption/absorption
technology with fabric filters may be required at most of PPL's Pennsylvania
coal-fired generating units if required reductions cannot be achieved by the
chemical injection systems.  Based on current analysis and industry
estimates, PPL estimates that if this technology were required at every one of
its Pennsylvania coal-fired generating units, the aggregate capital cost of
compliance would be approximately $530 million.

Montana
also has finalized its own mercury rules that require, by 2010, every coal-fired
generating plant in that state to achieve reduction levels more stringent than
the CAMR's 2018 requirements.  PPL is installing chemical injection
systems to meet these requirements.  PPL estimates that its share of
the capital cost for these systems in Montana will be approximately $8
million.  Because enhanced chemical injection technologies may not be
sufficiently developed to meet this level of reductions by 2010, there is a risk
that adsorption/absorption technology with fabric filters at both Colstrip and
Corette would be required.  Based on current analysis and industry
estimates, PPL estimates that if this technology were required, its share of the
capital cost to achieve compliance at its Montana units would be approximately
$140 million.

Regional Haze and
Visibility

In
addition to the above rules, the Clean Air Visibility Rule was issued by the EPA
in June 2005, to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused
by multiple sources over a wide area.  The rule defines Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including
presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides controls for large
units.  Under the BART rule, PPL submitted to the Pennsylvania DEP its
analyses of the visibility impacts of particulate matter emissions from Martins
Creek Units 3 and 4, Brunner Island Units 2 and 3 and Montour Units 1 and
2.  PPL has not received any comments from DEP on these
submissions.  The EPA had determined that meeting the requirements for
CAIR also met the BART requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
dioxide.

Also
under the BART rule, PPL submitted to the EPA its analyses of the visibility
impacts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions for
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and Corette.  PPL's analyses have shown that
further reductions are not needed.  The EPA has responded to PPL's
reports for Colstrip and Corette and requested further information and
analysis.  PPL completed further analysis and submitted addendums to
its initial reports for Colstrip and Corette.  On February 2, 2009,
PPL received an information request for additional data related to the Colstrip
generating station non-BART affected emission sources.  PPL is
evaluating this request.

PPL
cannot predict whether any additional reductions will be required in
Pennsylvania or Montana.  If additional reductions are required, the
costs are not now determinable, but could be significant.

New Source Review
(NSR)

In 1999,
the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric generators,
asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those generators have,
over the years, been modified in ways that increased their emissions and
subjected them to more stringent NSR requirements under the Clean Air
Act.  The EPA subsequently issued information requests and notices of
violation as well as commenced enforcement actions against other
generators.  PPL received such information requests for its Colstrip,
Corette and Martins Creek plants.  Although the EPA announced in 2005
that it would not bring new enforcement actions under these NSR rules, the
Justice Department recently declared that it is now considering bringing such
actions.  Similarly, the EPA has now decided not to finalize
rules it had proposed in 2005 that would have substantially reduced the
uncertainties in determining whether there has been an emissions increase
associated with any plant modification.

In
January 2009, PPL received a notice of violation from the EPA for projects
undertaken at the Keystone plant at which PPL is part owner.  The EPA
alleges that the projects were undertaken without proper NSR
oversight.  PPL cannot predict the outcome of this
proceeding.

States
and environmental groups also have brought enforcement actions alleging
violations of the NSR regulations by coal-fired plants, and PPL is unable to
predict whether such state or citizen enforcement actions will be brought with
respect to any of PPL affiliates' plants.

If the
NSR regulations are imposed on PPL's past activities, then PPL must install best
available control technology for any pollutant found to have significantly
increased due to a major modification.  The costs to install and
operate such technology are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

Finally,
if the EPA regulates carbon dioxide emissions pursuant to the 2007 U.S. Supreme
Court decision on global climate change (as discussed below), carbon dioxide
emissions could become subject to the NSR provisions of the Clean Air
Act.  The implications are uncertain, as currently no permitting
authorities have implemented the NSR regulations for carbon dioxide
emissions.

Opacity

The New
Jersey DEP and certain New Jersey residents have raised environmental concerns
with respect to the visible opacity of emissions from the oil-fired units at the
Martins Creek plant.  Similar issues also are being raised by the
Pennsylvania DEP.  PPL studied the issue and as a result installed
chemical injection systems to reduce visible emissions.  If it is
determined that further actions must be taken to address the visible opacity of
these emissions, such actions could result in costs that are not now
determinable, but could be significant.

Global Climate
Change

There is
concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the
contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly, carbon
dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels.  This concern has led to
increased federal legislative proposals, actions at regional, state and local
levels, as well as litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions, including an
April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the EPA has the authority to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air
Act.  As a result of this decision, in July 2008 the EPA issued an
"Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking," proposing alternative approaches to
regulate carbon dioxide emissions.  Upon taking office in January
2009, President Obama reaffirmed statements he made during the presidential
campaign about his support for mandatory regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,
including a cap-and-trade system.  President Obama's appointee for
Administrator of the EPA has indicated that the EPA is moving forward with
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the CAIR, though the exact form of
such regulation remains unclear.  Also, increased pressure for carbon
dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by investor and environmental
organizations, and the international community.  The construction and
operation of coal-fired power plants have received particularly intense
scrutiny.

PPL
believes future legislation and regulations that cap carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants are likely, although technology to efficiently capture, remove
and sequester carbon dioxide emissions is not presently available at a
commercial scale.  At the federal level, such legislation has received
support from President Obama and the majority leadership in both the U.S. Senate
and U.S. House of Representatives.  PPL supports a national program
and has publicly supported the key concepts of the "Low Carbon Economy Act of
2007" introduced in the Senate in July 2007, including an economy-wide approach,
a gradual phase-in of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and timetables,
and cost containment measures to limit the cost to the economy.

At the
regional level, ten northeastern states signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) agreeing to establish a greenhouse gas emission cap-and-trade program,
called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).  The program
commences in January 2009 and calls for stabilization of carbon dioxide
emissions, at base levels established in 2005, from electric power plants larger
than 25 MW in capacity.  The MOU also provides for a 10% reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions from base levels by 2019.  Similar efforts
are under way in the western U.S. (the Western Regional Climate Action
Initiative (WCI)) and Midwestern states (the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Accord).

Pennsylvania
and Montana have not, at this time, established mandatory programs to regulate
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Pennsylvania has not
stated an intention to join RGGI, but has enacted the Pennsylvania Climate
Change Act of 2008 (Act).  That Act established a Climate Change
Advisory Committee to advise the DEP on the development of a Climate Change
Action Plan.  Montana has joined the WCI and is expected to
participate in any greenhouse gas emission control regulations that are adopted
by the WCI.  The WCI, which has a goal of reducing carbon dioxide
emissions 15% below the 2005 levels by 2020, currently is developing greenhouse
gas emission allocations, offsets, and reporting recommendations.

PPL has
conducted an inventory of its carbon dioxide emissions and is continuing to
evaluate options for reducing, avoiding, off-setting or sequestering its carbon
dioxide emissions.

PPL
believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material
impact on its future capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not
now determinable.  PPL also cannot predict the impact that any pending
or future federal or state climate change legislation requiring more stringent
environmental standards could have on PPL or its subsidiaries.

Water/Waste

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

Martins Creek Fly Ash
Release

In August
2005, there was a release of approximately 100 million gallons of water
containing fly ash from a disposal basin at the Martins Creek plant used in
connection with the operation of the two 150 MW coal-fired generating units
at the plant.  This resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent
roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware
River.  The leak was stopped, and PPL has determined that the problem
was caused by a failure in the disposal basin's discharge
structure.  PPL has conducted extensive clean-up and completed
studies, in conjunction with a group of natural resource trustees and the
Delaware River Basin Commission, evaluating the effects of the release on the
river's sediment, water quality and ecosystem.  These studies do not
show any environmental damage attributable to the release.

The
Pennsylvania DEP filed a complaint in Commonwealth Court against PPL Martins
Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state laws and
regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief.  The Delaware
Riverside Conservancy and several citizens were granted the right, without
objection from PPL, to intervene in the Pennsylvania DEP's
action.  PPL and the Pennsylvania DEP have settled this
matter.  The settlement required a payment of $1.5 million in
penalties and reimbursement of the DEP's costs.  PPL made this payment
in the second quarter of 2008.  The settlement also requires PPL to
submit a report on the completed studies of possible natural resource
damages.  PPL submitted the assessment report to the agencies in June
2007.  PPL met with the agencies in January 2009 to discuss the status
of their natural resource damage assessment and their review of the June 2007
report.  The agencies have not completed their assessment and will be
providing written documentation on their damage assessment at a later
date.  At this point PPL is not certain whether the agencies may
require additional studies, but PPL does expect the trustees and the Delaware
River Basin Commission will seek to recover their costs and/or restoration costs
for damages that they can demonstrate were caused by the release.

Through
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply spent $28 million for remediation and
related costs.  In the second quarter of 2008, PPL Energy Supply
reduced its remaining remediation liability by $2 million and at December 31,
2008, an immaterial remediation liability remained.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply cannot be certain of the outcome of the natural resource damage
assessment, the outcome of any lawsuit brought by the citizens and businesses or
the exact nature of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be
initiated against PPL, PPL Energy Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of
the disposal basin leak.

Basin Seepage -
Pennsylvania

Seepages
have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins at various PPL
plants, including the Montour, Brunner Island and Martins Creek generating
facilities.  PPL has completed an assessment of some of the seepages
at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities and is working with the
Pennsylvania DEP to implement abatement measures for those
seepages.  PPL is continuing to conduct assessments of other seepages
at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities as well as seepages at the Martins
Creek facility to determine the appropriate abatement actions.  PPL
currently plans to spend up to $50 million to upgrade and/or replace certain
wastewater facilities in response to the seepage and for other facility
changes.  The potential additional cost to address the identified
seepages or other seepages at all of PPL's Pennsylvania plants is not now
determinable, but could be significant.

Basin Seepage -
Montana

In May
2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs brought an action against PPL Montana and the
other owners of the Colstrip plant alleging property damage from seepage from
the freshwater and wastewater ponds at Colstrip.  In the first quarter
of 2008, PPL Montana recorded an additional reserve of $7 million ($0.01 per
share, basic and diluted, for PPL) to "Operation and maintenance" on the
Statement of Income.  In July 2008, the plaintiffs and the
owner-defendants remaining after dismissal of NorthWestern due to its
bankruptcy, executed a settlement agreement.  PPL Montana and the
other remaining owner-defendants funded the settlement, concluding the
matter.  PPL Montana's share of the settlement was approximately $8
million.  In June 2008, PPL Montana recorded an insignificant reserve
for its share of potential additional settlements with three property owners
living near the original plaintiffs but who were not parties to the
lawsuit.  PPL Montana may incur additional costs related to the
potential claims, including additional groundwater investigations and any
related remedial measures, which costs are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

In
February 2007, six plaintiffs filed a separate lawsuit in the Montana Sixteenth
Judicial District Court against the Colstrip plant owners asserting similar
property damage claims as were asserted by the plaintiffs to the May 2003
complaint.  The lawsuit is in its initial stages of discovery and
investigation, and PPL Montana is unable to predict the outcome of these
proceedings.  PPL Montana has undertaken certain groundwater
investigations and remediation at the Colstrip plant to address groundwater
contamination alleged by the plaintiffs as well as other groundwater
contamination at the plant.  PPL Montana may incur further costs based
on the outcome of this lawsuit and its additional groundwater investigations and
any related remedial measures, which costs are not now determinable, but could
be significant.

Other
Issues

The EPA
significantly increased the water quality standard for arsenic in January 2006,
but limited the standard to drinking water.  In Pennsylvania, at its
September 2008 meeting, the Environmental Quality Board approved the Triennial
Review, in which the arsenic standard had been proposed as an in-stream water
quality standard.  However, the Pennsylvania Independent Regulatory
Review Commission (IRRC) disapproved the Triennial Review because of a
molybdenum standard inserted by the DEP.  IRRC determined that the
lower standard was not justified because the DEP did not have sufficient
scientific basis for the change.  The Triennial Review will not be
finalized until the DEP either submits data to prove the scientific basis for
the standard or drops the new standard from the Triennial
Review.  Therefore, the arsenic standard will not go into effect until
the Triennial Review is finalized.  Once finalized, the revised
arsenic standard may result in action by individual states that could require
several PPL subsidiaries to further treat wastewater and/or take abatement
action at their power plants.  The cost of complying with any such
requirements is not now determinable, but could be significant.

The EPA
finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake
structures.  These requirements affect where generating facilities are
built, establish intake design standards and could lead to requirements for
cooling towers at new and modified power plants.  Another rule
finalized in 2004 that addressed existing structures has been withdrawn
following a January 2007 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.  In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions for
writs of certiorari filed by Utility Water Act Group, Public Service Enterprise
Group, Inc. and Entergy Corporation, limited to one issue.  The issue
is whether Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to compare
costs with benefits in determining the "best technology available for minimizing
adverse environmental impact" at cooling water intake structures.  The
Supreme Court heard oral arguments in December 2008.  The outcome of
the U.S. Supreme Court review, changes the EPA makes to the rule in accordance
with this decision, other issues raised by the Second Circuit Court (that will
not be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court) and actions the states may take on
their own could result in stricter standards for existing structures that could
impose significant costs on PPL subsidiaries.

The EPA
released its 2008 Effluent Guidelines Plan and has chosen not to revise the
steam electric effluent guidelines.  Instead, the EPA plans to
continue to study the industry's wastewater discharges, with a focus on
coal-fired plants and "particular interest" in Flue Gas Desulfurization
wastewater treatment, ash sluice water management and water reuse
opportunities.  The EPA plans to continue to study the industry
through 2009 and 2010 annual reviews, including sampling at selected
plants.

PPL has
signed a consent order with the Pennsylvania DEP under which it will take
further actions to minimize the possibility of fish kills at its Brunner Island
plant.  Fish are attracted to warm water in power plant discharge
channels, especially during cold weather.  In the past, some fish
kills have occurred at Brunner Island when debris at the intake pumps resulted
in a unit trip or reduction in load, causing a sudden change in water
temperature in the discharge channel when fish were present.

PPL paid
a nominal penalty to the DEP for fish kills that occurred in October 2007 and
March 2008.  In addition, PPL had committed to construct a barrier to
prevent debris from entering the intake area.  However, due to
potential impacts in the floodplain, PPL was not able to obtain the necessary
authorization from local townships and an alternative plan is being
developed.  PPL has also committed to investigate alternatives to
completely exclude fish from the discharge area.  PPL will need to
implement one of these alternatives if a fish kill occurs after construction of
the cooling towers at Brunner Island is completed in 2010.  The costs
of these measures are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

Superfund
and Other Remediation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric is a potentially responsible party at several sites listed by the EPA
under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant Site and
the Ward Transformer site.  Clean-up actions have been or are being
undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant
to PPL.  However, should the EPA require different or additional
measures in the future, or should PPL's share of costs at multi-party sites
increase significantly more than currently expected, the costs to PPL could be
significant.

PPL
Electric has been remediating several sites that were not being addressed under
another regulatory program such as Superfund, but for which PPL Electric may be
liable for remediation.  These include a number of coal gas
manufacturing facilities formerly owned or operated by a p

redecessor
to

PPL Electric.  In addition, PPL Gas Utilities was
remediating various sites including coal gas manufacturing facilities and
potential mercury contamination from gas meters and regulators and was engaged
in a program to plug abandoned wells.  On October 1, 2008, PPL Gas
Utilities was sold and, with limited exceptions, the remediation and
well-plugging liabilities were transferred.  The exceptions do not
impose material retained liabilities.

Depending
on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or
have not been completed, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be
substantial.  PPL and its subsidiaries also could incur other
non-remediation costs at sites included in the consent orders or other
contaminated sites, the costs of which are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

The EPA
is evaluating the risks associated with naphthalene, a chemical by-product of
coal gas manufacturing.  As a result of the EPA's evaluation,
individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil
cleanup.  This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more
extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing
facilities.  The costs to PPL of complying with any such requirements
are not now determinable, but could be significant.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Under the
Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated to
remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take
additional steps to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped
refuse piles.  One PPL Generation subsidiary is pumping mine water at
two mine sites and treating water at one of these sites.  Another PPL
Generation subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a
third site.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply had accrued
a discounted liability of $24 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating
groundwater at the two mine sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining
passive wetlands treatment at the third site.  PPL Energy Supply
discounted this liability based on risk free rates at the time of the mine
closures.  The weighted average rate used was
8.18%.  Expected undiscounted payments are estimated at $1 million for
each of the years from 2009 through 2013, and the expected payments for the work
after 2013 are $144 million.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Future
cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not
currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for PPL
subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time.

Electric
and Magnetic Fields

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Concerns
have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
substation equipment.  Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K.
have reviewed this issue.  The U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes,
there is no evidence that EMFs cause adverse effects.  The agency
further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with
childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without
supporting laboratory evidence.  The U.K. National Radiological
Protection Board (part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded in 2004
that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that EMFs
cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
existing exposure guidelines.  In April 2007, the Stakeholder Group on
Extremely Low Frequency EMF, set up by the U.K. Government, issued its interim
assessment which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to
EMFs.  This assessment is being considered by the U.K.
Government.  PPL and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to
determine whether EMFs cause adverse health effects should continue and are
taking steps to reduce EMFs, where practical, in the design of new transmission
and distribution facilities.  PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to
predict what effect, if any, the EMF issue might have on their operations and
facilities either in the U.S. or the U.K., and the associated cost, or what, if
any, liabilities they might incur related to the EMF issue.

Environmental Matters - WPD

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

WPD's
distribution businesses are subject to environmental regulatory and statutory
requirements.  PPL believes that WPD has taken and continues to take
measures to comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the
protection of the environment.  There are no material legal or
administrative proceedings pending against WPD with respect to environmental
matters.  See "Environmental Matters - Domestic - Electric and
Magnetic Fields" for a discussion of EMFs.

Other

Nuclear
Insurance

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

PPL
Susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage for
property damage to members' nuclear generating stations.  Facilities
at the Susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses up to
$2.75 billion under these programs.  PPL Susquehanna is also a member
of an insurance program that provides insurance coverage for the cost of
replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain
specified conditions.  Under the property and replacement power
insurance programs, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in
the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience.  At
December 31, 2008, this maximum assessment was about $38
million.

In the
event of a nuclear incident at the Susquehanna station, PPL Susquehanna's public
liability for claims resulting from such incident would be limited to about
$12.5 billion under provisions of The Price-Anderson Act Amendments under the
Energy Policy Act of 2005.  PPL Susquehanna is protected against this
liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment
program.  In the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors
covered by The Price-Anderson Act Amendments under the Energy Policy Act of
2005, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $235 million per incident, payable
at $35 million per year.

At
December 31, 2008, the property, replacement power and nuclear incident insurers
maintained a minimum A.M. Best rating of at least A-.

Guarantees and Other
Assurances

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In the
normal course of business, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric enter into
agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries.  Such agreements include, for example,
guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and
surety bonds issued by insurance companies.  These agreements are
entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to
a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities
in which these subsidiaries enter.

(PPL)

PPL fully
and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of PPL Capital
Funding.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric provide certain guarantees that are required to
be disclosed in accordance with FIN 45.  The table below details
guarantees provided as of December 31, 2008.

(a)

Represents
      the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be
      required to be made under the guarantee.

(b)

Other
      than the letters of credit, all guarantees of PPL Energy Supply also apply
      to PPL on a consolidated basis.

(c)

Except
      for a recorded liability for which payment is probable as discussed in
      "Description."

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries provide other
miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of
business.  These guarantees are primarily in the form of
indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in
duration.  The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly
stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees
cannot be reasonably estimated.  Historically, PPL, PPL Energy Supply
and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries have not made any significant payments
with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of
payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.  At December 31,
2008, the aggregate fair value of the indemnities related to arrangements
entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 was insignificant.  Among
these guarantees are:

PPL, on
behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that
covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property
damage.  The coverage requires a $4 million deductible per occurrence
and provides maximum aggregate coverage of $150 million.  This
insurance may be applicable to certain obligations under the contractual
arrangements discussed above.

In
February 2007, WPD LLP redeemed all of the 8.23% Subordinated Debentures
maturing in February 2027 that were held by SIUK Capital Trust
I.  Interest expense on this obligation was $2 million and $11 million
for 2007 and 2006.  The redemption resulted in a recorded loss of $2
million during 2007.  This interest expense and loss are both
reflected in "Interest Expense" for PPL and "Interest Expense with Affiliate"
for PPL Energy Supply on the Statements of Income.  See Note 24
for additional information on the trust.

PLR
Contracts

(PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric has power sales agreements with PPL EnergyPlus, effective July 2000 and
January 2002, in which PPL EnergyPlus will supply all of PPL Electric's PLR load
through December 31, 2009.  Under these contracts, PPL EnergyPlus
provides electricity at the predetermined capped prices that PPL Electric is
authorized to charge its PLR customers.  These purchases totaled $1.8
billion in 2008 and 2007 and $1.7 billion in 2006.  These purchases
include nuclear decommissioning recovery and amortization of an up-front
contract payment and are included in the Statements of Income as "Wholesale
energy marketing to affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Energy purchases
from affiliate" by PPL Electric.

Under one
of the PLR contracts, PPL Electric is required to make performance assurance
deposits with PPL EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than
the contract price by more than its contract collateral
threshold.  Conversely, PPL EnergyPlus is required to make performance
assurance deposits with PPL Electric when the market price of electricity is
greater than the contract price by more than its contract collateral
threshold.  PPL Electric estimated that at December 31, 2008, the
fair value of the contract was approximately $917
million.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply was
required to provide PPL Electric with performance assurance of $300 million, the
maximum amount required under the contract.  PPL Energy Supply's
deposit with PPL Electric was $300 million at both December 31, 2008 and
2007.  This deposit is shown on the Balance Sheets as "Collateral on
PLR energy supply to/from affiliate," a current asset of PPL Energy Supply and a
current liability of PPL Electric.  PPL Electric pays interest equal
to the one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% on this deposit, which is included in "Interest
Expense with Affiliate" on the Statements of Income.  PPL Energy
Supply records the receipt of the interest as affiliated interest income, which
is included in "Interest Income from Affiliates" on the Statements of
Income.  Interest related to this deposit was $10 million in 2008 and
$17 million in 2007 and 2006.

In 2001,
PPL Electric made a $90 million up-front payment to PPL EnergyPlus in connection
with the PLR contracts.  The up-front payment is being amortized by
both parties over the term of the PLR contracts.  The unamortized
balance of this payment and other payments under the contract was $12 million
and $24 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.  These balances
are reflected on the Balance Sheets as "Deferred revenue on PLR energy supply to
affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Prepayment on PLR energy supply from
affiliate" by PPL Electric.  These balances will be fully amortized
during 2009.

Under
Pennsylvania law and PUC regulations, PPL Electric is required to buy
electricity generation supply for customers who do not choose a competitive
supplier.  PPL Electric has conducted four of its six planned
competitive solicitations for generation supply in 2010, after its existing PLR
contract expires.  Competitive bids have been solicited for 3,400 MW
of generation supply, or two-thirds of PPL Electric's expected supply
requirements for these customers in 2010.  An independent company,
NERA Economic Consulting (NERA), is managing this competitive solicitation
process.  NERA compiles the results and presents them to the
PUC.  See Note 15 for additional information on the results of the
completed solicitations.  Additional bids will be sought twice in 2009
to secure the remainder of supply needed to serve PPL Electric's customers in
2010.

PPL
EnergyPlus was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive
solicitation process and has entered into an agreement with PPL Electric to
supply up to 671 MW of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42
per MWh.

Under the
standard Supply Master Agreement for the bid solicitation process, PPL Electric
requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined
credit limits.  In no instance is PPL Electric required to post
collateral to suppliers under these supply contracts.  PPL EnergyPlus
is required to post collateral with PPL Electric:  (a) when the market
price of electricity to be delivered by PPL EnergyPlus exceeds the contract
price for the forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered and (b) this
market price exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit.  Based on
the current credit rating of PPL Energy Supply, as guarantor, this credit limit
is $35 million.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply provided PPL
Electric with an insignificant letter of credit as performance
assurance.

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Electric had credit exposure to PPL EnergyPlus under the
PLR contracts and the solicitation discussed above, of $917
million.  As a result of netting and collateral arrangements, PPL
Electric's credit exposure was reduced to $445 million.

PPL
Energy Supply has credit exposure to PPL Electric under PLR
contracts.  At December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply's credit exposure
with PPL Electric was $171 million, excluding the effects of netting
arrangements.  As a result of netting arrangements, PPL Energy
Supply's credit exposure was reduced to zero.

Electric has a reciprocal contract with PPL EnergyPlus to sell electricity
purchased under contracts with NUGs.  PPL Electric purchases
electricity from the NUGs at contractual rates and then sells the electricity at
the same price to PPL EnergyPlus.  These purchases totaled $108
million in 2008, $156 million in 2007 and $157 million in 2006.  These
amounts are included in the Statements of Income as "Energy purchases from
affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Wholesale electric to affiliate" by PPL
Electric.

Allocations of Corporate Service
Costs

(PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources
and information services.  PPL Services charges the respective PPL
subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically
identified.  The cost of these services that is not directly charged
to PPL subsidiaries is allocated to certain of the subsidiaries based on an
average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and
maintenance expenses, and number of employees.  PPL Services allocated
the following amounts, which PPL management believes are reasonable, to PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric, including amounts applied to accounts that are
further distributed between capital and expense.

PPL
Energy Supply had no notes receivable from affiliates at December 31, 2008 and
2007.  Interest earned on loans to affiliates throughout the year,
included in "Interest Income from Affiliates" on the Statements of Income was $4
million, $12 million and $4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

(

PPL Electric)

In August
2004, a PPL Electric subsidiary issued a $300 million demand note to an
affiliate.  There was a balance outstanding of $300 million at
December 31, 2008, and $277 million at December 31,
2007.  Interest is due quarterly at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR
plus 1% in 2008 and 2007 and 1.25% in 2006.  This note is shown on the
Balance Sheets as "Note receivable from affiliate."  Interest earned
on the note is included in "Interest Income from Affiliate" on the Statements of
Income, and was $9 million, $19 million and $20 million for 2008, 2007 and
2006.

Intercompany Derivatives

(PPL
Energy Supply)

In 2008,
2007, and 2006, PPL Energy Supply entered into a combination of average rate
forwards and average rate options with PPL to sell British pounds
sterling.  These hedging instruments have terms identical to average
rate forwards and average rate options entered into by PPL with third parties to
protect the translation of expected income denominated in British pounds
sterling to U.S. dollars.  Gains and losses, both realized and
unrealized, on these types of hedging instruments are included in "Other income
- - net" on the Statements of Income.  For 2008, PPL Energy Supply
recorded a net gain of $9 million.  For both 2007 and 2006, PPL Energy
Supply recorded a net loss of $4 million.  None of these instruments
were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply entered into forward contracts with PPL to sell Chilean
pesos.  These hedging instruments had terms identical to forward sales
contracts entered into by PPL with third parties to protect the value of its net
investment in Emel, as well as a portion of the proceeds in excess of its net
investment expected from the then-anticipated sale of Emel.  None of
these contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.  For
2007, PPL Energy Supply's Statement of Income reflects losses of $7 million in
"Other income - net" and $23 million in Discontinued Operations related to these
contracts.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply also entered into forward contracts with PPL to sell British
pounds sterling to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in
WPD.  These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward sales
contracts entered into by PPL with third parties.  The total notional
amounts of the contracts outstanding were £68 million (approximately $134
million) at December 31, 2008 and £98 million (approximately $193 million) at
December 31, 2007.  The fair value of these positions was $34 million
and $3 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and is reflected in the foreign
currency translation adjustment component of AOCI on the Balance
Sheets.  Additionally, $16 million was reflected in "Current Assets -
Price risk management assets" on the Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008, and $18
million and $3 million was reflected in "Other Noncurrent Assets - Price risk
management assets" on the Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 and
2007.

Trademark Royalties

(PPL
Energy Supply)

A PPL
subsidiary owns PPL trademarks and bills certain affiliates for their
use.  PPL Energy Supply was allocated $48 million of this license fee
in 2008, $39 million in 2007 and $36 million in 2006.  These
allocations are primarily included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the
Statements of Income.

PPL
Energy Supply owns no domestic transmission or distribution facilities, other
than facilities to interconnect its generation with the electric transmission
system.  Therefore, PPL EnergyPlus and other PPL Generation
subsidiaries must pay PJM, the operator of the transmission system, to deliver
the energy these subsidiaries supply to retail and wholesale customers in PPL
Electric's franchised territory in eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  PJM in turn pays PPL Electric for the use of its
transmission system.  PPL eliminates the impact of these revenues and
expenses on its consolidated Statements of Income.

Fair Value Measurements

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Adoption
of SFAS 157

Effective
January 1, 2008, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 157.  SFAS 157
provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for measuring fair
value.  In addition, SFAS 157 expands the fair value disclosure
requirements of other accounting pronouncements to require, among other things,
disclosure of the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value as well as
the earnings impact of certain fair value measurement techniques.

As
defined by SFAS 157, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (an exit price).  Consistent with
the valuation techniques identified in SFAS 157, PPL and its subsidiaries use,
as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an
income approach (generally, present value techniques), and/or a cost approach
(generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or
liability.  These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as
observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management
believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to
price an asset or liability.  These inputs may incorporate, as
applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit
risk.

SFAS 157
established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
fair value into three broad levels.  The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is
classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety.  SFAS 157 recognizes that
assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that
considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  As such, PPL
and its subsidiaries' assessment of the significance of a particular input may
affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the fair value
hierarchy.

The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy as specified by SFAS 157 are:

The

Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

PPL and
its subsidiaries use the market approach to determine the fair value of cash and
cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.

Such fair
value measurements are classified as Level 1.

Short-term
Investments

PPL and
its subsidiaries use the market approach to determine the fair value of
short-term investments.  Such fair value measurements are classified
as Level 1.

Price Risk Management
Assets/Liabilities - Energy Commodities

The only
energy commodity contracts classified as Level 1 are exchange-traded derivative
gas and oil contracts.  When observable inputs are used to measure all
or most of the value of a contract, the contract is classified as Level
2.  Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are valued by traders using
quotes obtained from an exchange, binding and non-binding broker quotes, prices
posted by ISOs or published tariff rates.  PPL's risk management group
obtains quotes from the market to validate the forward price
curves.  OTC contracts include forwards, swaps, options and structured
deals for electricity, gas, oil, and/or emission allowances and may be offset
with similar positions in exchange-traded markets.  To the extent
possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted
prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.  In
certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including
standard option valuation models and standard industry models.  For
example, the fair value of a structured deal that delivers power to an illiquid
delivery point may be measured by valuing the nearest liquid trading point plus
the value of the basis between the two points.  The basis input may be
from market quotes, FTR prices, or historical prices.  When the
unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurement, the contract
is classified as Level 3.  Additionally, Level 2 and Level 3 fair
value measurements include adjustments for credit risk based on PPL's own
creditworthiness (for net liabilities) and its counterparties' creditworthiness
(for net assets).  PPL's credit department continues to assess all
reasonably available market information and currently uses probabilities of
default to calculate the credit adjustment.  PPL assumes that
observable market prices include sufficient adjustments for liquidity and
modeling risks, but for Level 3 fair value measurements, PPL also assesses the
need for additional adjustments for liquidity or modeling risks.  The
contracts classified as Level 3 represent contracts for which the delivery dates
are beyond the dates for which independent prices are available or for power
basis, which PPL generally values using historical prices.

In the
fourth quarter of 2008, PPL refined its valuation approach for FTR and PJM basis
positions, consistent with PPL's practice of pricing other less active trading
points.  As a result of these changes in valuation techniques, these
positions were transferred into Level 3.

Price Risk Management
Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate/Foreign Exchange

Treasury
instruments include forward-starting swaps, fixed-to-floating swaps, forwards
and options for foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency
swaps.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply generally use the income approach to
measure the fair value of the instruments, using common inputs such as forward
LIBOR and foreign exchange rates.  Similar to above, these fair value
measurements also include adjustments for credit risk.

Certain
contracts were transferred to Level 3 due to the significance of the credit
adjustment required at December 31, 2008.

Nuclear Plant
Decommissioning Trust Funds

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply generally use the market approach to measure the fair value of
the securities held in the nuclear plant decommissioning trust
funds.  The fair value measurement of equity securities is based on
quoted prices in active markets.  The fair value measurements of
commingled equity index funds are based on firm quotes of net asset values per
share, which are not obtained from a quoted price in an active
market.  The fair value measurements of debt securities are generally
based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as
actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities,
adjusted for observable differences.  When this information is not
available, the fair value of debt securities is measured using present value
techniques, which incorporate other observable inputs.

Auction Rate
Securities

At
December 31, 2008, the fair values of PPL and PPL Energy Supply's auction
rate securities were $24 million and $19 million.  These securities
are recorded in "Investments - Other" on the Balance Sheet.  PPL's and
PPL Energy Supply's auction rate securities include Federal Family Education
Loan Program's guaranteed student loan revenue bonds as well as various
municipal bond issues, all of which are rated investment grade.

Auction
rate securities have normally been remarketed on a short-term basis with auction
dates commonly set at seven-day, 28-day, 35-day or 49-day
intervals.  Historically, an active market existed for such
investments, and the auctions provided an opportunity for investors either to
hold an investment at a periodically reset interest rate or to sell the
investment at its par value for immediate liquidity.  In early 2008,
investor concerns about credit and liquidity in the financial markets,
generally, as well as investor concerns over specific insurers that guarantee
the credit of certain of the underlying securities, created uncertainty in the
auction rate securities market and these securities generally failed to be
remarketed through their established auction process.  These auction
failures and the resulting illiquidity continued to impact PPL's and PPL Energy
Supply's auction rate securities.  Auction rate securities were
transferred into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the first
quarter of 2008.  The failed auctions limit the amount of observable
market data that is available for measuring the fair value of these
securities.

At
December 31, 2008, the par value of these auction rate securities totaled
$29 million for PPL and $24 million for PPL Energy
Supply.  Contractual maturities for these auction rate securities are
a weighted average of approximately 28 years for both PPL and PPL Energy
Supply.  Historically, the fair value of auction rate securities
approximated their par value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates
through the auction process.  The auctions for these outstanding
securities failed in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, and PPL and
PPL Energy Supply continued to earn interest on these investments at
contractually prescribed interest rates.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply estimated the fair value of auction rate securities based on
the following criteria:  (i) the underlying structure and credit
quality of each security; (ii) the present value of future estimated interest
and principal payments discounted using interest rates for bonds with a credit
rating and remaining term to maturity similar to the stated maturity of the
auction rate securities; and (iii) consideration of the impact of auction
failures or redemption at par for each period.  These estimated fair
values could change significantly based on future market
conditions.  See Note 23 for additional information on these
securities.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Management
of Market Risk Exposures

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL and PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of
price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity
instrument.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply are exposed to market risk
from:

·

commodity
      price risk for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale
      of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity marketing
      activities, and the purchase of fuel for generating assets and energy
      trading activities;

·

interest
      rate and price risk associated with debt used to finance operations, as
      well as debt and equity securities in PPL's nuclear decommissioning trust
      funds and PPL's defined benefit plans; and

·

foreign
      currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in U.K.
      affiliates, as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than
      U.S. dollars.

PPL has a
risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk
and counterparty credit risk.  The RMC, comprised of senior management
and chaired by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, and daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations, and
other risk management metrics.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
and structured deals such as tolling agreements as part of the risk management
strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility.  All derivatives
are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet
criteria for exclusion under SFAS 133.  See discussion in "Accounting
Designations" below.

Fair
Value Hedges

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into financial contracts to hedge fluctuations in the
market value of existing debt issuances, which range in maturity through 2047
for PPL and 2011 for PPL Energy Supply.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply
also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exchange rates
associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies; however, at
December 31, 2008, there were no existing contracts of this nature.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply did not recognize significant gains or losses resulting from
hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges in
2008, 2007 or 2006.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply also did not recognize
any gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges
for these years.

Cash
Flow Hedges

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical contracts, including
forwards, futures, swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated with
electric, gas, oil and other commodities.  These contracts range in
maturity through 2017.  Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter
into financial interest rate swap contracts to hedge floating interest rate risk
associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances.  These
interest rate swap contracts range in maturity through 2039.  PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge the cash
flows associated with foreign currency-denominated debt, the exchange rates
associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and the net
investment in the U.K. operations.  These contracts range in maturity
through 2028.

Cash flow
hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted
transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time
periods.  In certain instances, amounts previously recorded in AOCI
are reclassified to earnings.  Such reclassifications were after-tax
losses of $3 million in 2007 and gains of $5 million in 2006.  There
were no such reclassifications in 2008.

For 2008,
2007 and 2006, hedge ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives was,
after tax, a gain of $12 million, a loss of $3 million, and a gain of $8
million.

Additionally,
during 2008, certain power and gas cash flow hedges failed hedge effectiveness
testing.  As prescribed by SFAS 133, hedge accounting is not permitted
for the quarter in which this occurs and, accordingly, the entire change in fair
value for the periods that failed was recorded to the income statement,
resulting in an after-tax gain of $298 million.  These transactions
were not dedesignated as hedges, since prospective regression analysis still
supports that these hedges are expected to be highly effective.  The
fair value of these positions increased significantly due to the sharp decline
in power and gas prices during the second half of 2008.

For 2008,
2007 and 2006, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate and foreign
currency derivatives was not significant.

This
table shows the accumulated net unrealized after-tax losses on qualifying
derivatives (excluding net investment hedges), which are included in
AOCI.

At
December 31, 2008, the accumulated net unrealized after-tax losses on qualifying
derivatives that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next
12 months were $35 million for PPL and $40 million for PPL Energy
Supply.  Amounts are reclassified as the energy contracts go to
delivery and as interest payments are made.

Economic
Activity

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have entered into energy derivative transactions that
economically hedge a specific risk or optimize an asset position, but do not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 or hedge accounting was not
elected.  These transactions are used to hedge the economic value of
PPL and PPL Energy Supply's generation assets and its full-requirement contracts
and retail activities.  Although these transactions do not receive
hedge accounting treatment, they are considered non-trading
activity.  In addition, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is
included in economic activity.  Unrealized gains (losses) on this
activity are reflected in the Statements of Income as follows.

The net
unrealized gains recorded in "Wholesale energy marketing" for 2008 resulted
primarily from certain full-requirement sales contracts in which PPL and PPL
Energy Supply did not elect the normal purchase/normal sale exception and the
impact of quarterly hedge ineffectiveness as discussed in the "Cash Flow Hedges"
section above.  The net unrealized losses recorded in "Energy
purchases" for 2008 resulted primarily from certain purchase contracts to supply
the full-requirement contracts noted above in which PPL and PPL Energy Supply
did not elect hedge treatment and from hedge ineffectiveness.  Since
power prices have decreased significantly during the period, these fixed-price
contracts have resulted in substantial unrealized gains and losses.

Net
Investment Hedges

Net
investment hedge activity is reported in the foreign currency translation
adjustment component of OCI.  These contracts range in maturity
through 2011.  During 2008, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recognized net
investment hedge gains, after tax, of $20 million in OCI.  During 2007
and 2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recognized hedge gains, after tax, of $2
million and insignificant amounts in OCI related to net investment hedge
activity.  At December 31, 2008, $16 million of accumulated net
investment hedge gains, after tax, were included in the foreign currency
translation adjustment component of AOCI compared with $4 million of losses at
December 31, 2007.

Accounting
Designations

For
energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the circumstances and
intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine
their accounting designation, which is subsequently verified by an independent
internal group on a daily basis.  The following summarizes the
electricity guidelines that have been provided to the marketers who are
responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts in
accordance with SFAS 133.

Any
unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment
to the extent they are highly effective are recorded in OCI.  These
unrealized gains and losses become realized when the contracts settle and are
recognized in income when the hedged transactions occur.

In
addition to energy-related transactions, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into
financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest
rate and foreign currency risk associated with both existing and anticipated
debt issuances.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign
currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated
in a foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations.  As
with energy transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time of
the transaction determine a contract's accounting designation, which is
subsequently verified by an independent internal group on a daily
basis.  The following is a summary of certain guidelines that have
been provided to PPL's Finance Department, which is responsible for contract
designation.

Credit
Concentration

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries enter into contracts with many entities for the purchase and
sale of energy.  Many of these contracts are considered a normal part
of doing business and, as such, the fair value of these contracts is not
reflected in the financial statements.  However, the fair value of
these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit
perspective.

PPL and
its subsidiaries have credit exposure to energy trading partners.  The
majority of these exposures are the fair value of multi-year contracts for
energy sales and purchases.  Therefore, if these counterparties fail
to perform their obligations under such contracts, PPL and its subsidiaries
would not experience an immediate financial loss but would experience lower
revenues or higher costs in future years to the extent that replacement sales or
purchases could not be made at the same prices as those under the defaulted
contracts.

PPL and
its subsidiaries have credit policies to manage its credit risk, including the
use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty
positions, and the use of master netting agreements.  These agreements
include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral
requirements.  PPL may request the additional credit assurance in the
event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade or
their exposures exceed an established credit limit.

(PPL)

At
December 31, 2008, PPL had credit exposure of $2.6 billion to energy trading
partners, excluding the effects of netting arrangements.  As a result
of netting arrangements and collateral, PPL's credit exposure was reduced to
$558 million.  One of the counterparties accounted for 13% of this
exposure and no other individual counterparty accounted for more than 10% of the
exposure.  Ten counterparties accounted for $326 million, or 58%, of
the total exposure.  Eight of these counterparties had an investment
grade credit rating from S&P and accounted for 83% of the top 10
exposure.  The two counterparties that are not rated investment grade
have posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit as per the terms and
conditions of their respective contracts and are current on their
obligations.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Energy Supply had credit exposure of $2.6 billion to
energy trading partners, excluding the effects of netting
arrangements.  As a result of netting arrangements and collateral, PPL
Energy Supply's credit exposure was reduced to $571 million.  One of
the counterparties accounted for 13% of this exposure and no other individual
counterparty accounted for more than 9% of the exposure.  Ten
counterparties accounted for $326 million or 57% of the total
exposure.  Eight of these counterparties had an investment grade
credit rating from S&P and accounted for 83% of the top 10
exposure.  The two counterparties that are not rated investment grade
have posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit as per the terms and
conditions of their respective contracts and are current on their
obligations.

PPL
Energy Supply has credit exposure to PPL Electric under the long-term contract
for PPL EnergyPlus to supply PPL Electric's PLR load.  This exposure
is excluded from the exposure discussed above.  See Note 16 for
additional information on the related party credit exposure.

(PPL
Electric)

At
December 31, 2008, PPL Electric had no credit exposure as a result of its two
solicitation bids in 2007 and two solicitation bids in 2008 for the 2010 PLR
supply.  The successful bidders were nine suppliers, all of which had
an investment grade credit rating from S&P.  PPL EnergyPlus was
one of the successful bidders in the first competitive solicitation
process.

Additionally,
PPL Electric has credit exposure to PPL Energy Supply under the PLR
contracts.  This exposure is excluded from the exposure discussed
above.  See Note 16 for additional information on the related party
credit exposure.

PPL
Electric's accounts receivable and revenues are primarily from customers in
eastern and central Pennsylvania; as a result, there is a concentration of
credit risk associated with this geographic concentration.  PPL
Electric requires deposits from customers deemed to have higher credit
risk.  This credit risk is also mitigated by the high number of
customers and relatively low balances on an individual customer
basis.  The net credit exposure at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $405
million and $385 million.

1,154

The
decrease of $228 million in 2008 compared with 2007, in the International
Delivery segment was due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The
decrease of $108 million in 2007 compared with 2006, in the International
Delivery segment reflects a $160 million decrease due to the sale of the Latin
American businesses.  This decrease was partially offset by increases
of $52 million primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates.  The decrease of $55 million in the Pennsylvania
Delivery segment was attributable to the transfer of goodwill associated with
the natural gas distribution and propane businesses to "Assets held for sale" on
the Balance Sheet as a result of the then-anticipated sale of these
businesses.  See Note 10 for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

As
required by SFAS 143, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded various legal
obligations to retire long-lived assets, the largest of which relates to the
decommissioning of the Susquehanna plant.  Other AROs PPL and PPL
Energy Supply recorded relate to significant interim retirements at the
Susquehanna plant and various environmental requirements for coal piles, ash
basins and other waste basin retirements at Susquehanna and other
facilities.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have recorded several conditional AROs, the most significant
of which related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing
material.

In
addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL
and PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but were
unable to reasonably estimate their fair values.  These retirement
obligations could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement
dates.  The generation plants, where significant amounts of
asbestos-containing material are located, have been well maintained and large
capital and environmental investments are being made at these
plants.  During the previous five years, the useful lives of the
plants had been reviewed and in most cases significantly
extended.  Due to these circumstances, PPL management was unable to
reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates for the
remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at the generation
plants.  If economic events or other circumstances change that enable
PPL and PPL Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these
retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that time.

Other
conditional AROs that were recorded related to treated wood poles, gas-filled
plant and fluid-filled cables.  These obligations, required by U.K.
law, had an insignificant impact on the financial
statements.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations associated with
the retirement of a reservoir and certain transmission assets that could not be
reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates.

The
changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were:

$


Changes
in ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various
AROs, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are
incorporated into the latest estimates of the obligation.  In 2008,
PPL Energy Supply changed estimated settlement dates and revised cost estimates
for remediating several AROs, the most significant being the ash basins at the
Montour and Brunner Island plants.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply
recognized additional liabilities for asbestos-containing material at several
plants.  In 2007, PPL and PPL Energy Supply changed estimated
settlement dates on several AROs, the most significant being the ash basins at
the Martins Creek plant.  The effect of these changes was to decrease
the ARO liability and related plant balances by $4 million in 2008 and increase
the ARO liability and related plant balances by $11 million in
2007.  The 2008 and 2007 income statement impact of these changes was
insignificant.

The most
significant ARO recorded by PPL and PPL Energy Supply relates to the
decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The expected cost
to decommission the Susquehanna plant is based on a 2002 site-specific study
that estimated the cost to dismantle and decommission each unit immediately
following final shutdown.  PPL Susquehanna's 90% share of the total
estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna plant was approximately $936
million measured in 2002 dollars.  This estimate includes
decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal
of non-radiological structures and materials.

The
accrued nuclear decommissioning obligation, as determined under the provisions
of SFAS 143, was $322 million and $298 million at December 31, 2008 and
2007, and is included in "Asset retirement obligations" on the Balance
Sheets.  The fair value of investments that are legally restricted for
the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant was $446 million and $555
million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and is included in "Nuclear plant
decommissioning trust funds" on the Balance Sheets.  See Notes 18 and
23 for additional information on the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds.  Accretion expense, as determined under the provisions of SFAS
143, was $24 million in 2008, $22 million in 2007 and $21 million in 2006, and
is included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of
Income.

(PPL
Electric)

PPL
Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of
certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to
indeterminable settlement dates.  These assets are located on
rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or
remove the assets.  Since this option is at the discretion of the
grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these
events may occur.

Available-for-Sale Securities

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
accordance with SFAS 115, PPL and its subsidiaries classify auction rate
securities, certain short-term investments and securities held by the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale
securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.  Unrealized
gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of tax, in OCI or are
recognized currently in earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to
be other-than-temporary.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The
following tables show the gross unrealized gains recorded in AOCI and the
related fair value of available-for-sale securities at
December 31.  See Note 18 for additional information regarding
the 2008 fair value of these securities.

$90 million, $57 million and $143 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006.  PPL
Electric did not incur any unrealized or realized gains (losses) during 2008,
2007 or 2006 as cost approximated fair value.

Nuclear

Decommissioning

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Beginning
in January 1999, in accordance with the PUC Final Order, approximately $130
million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from PPL Electric's
customers through the CTC over the 11-year life of the CTC rather than the
remaining life of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.  The recovery
includes a return on unamortized decommissioning costs.  Under the
power supply agreements between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, these revenues
are passed on to PPL EnergyPlus.  Similarly, these revenues are passed
on to PPL Susquehanna under a power supply agreement between PPL EnergyPlus and
PPL Susquehanna.

Amounts
collected from PPL Electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable
taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only be used
for future decommissioning costs.  To the extent that the actual costs
for decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds, PPL Susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the
shortfall.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, which was effective
for PPL and PPL Energy Supply beginning January 1, 2006.  Among other
things, FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 indicated that existing guidance,
particularly SAB Topic 5M, should be used to determine if a decline in a
security's value is other-than-temporary.  Clarification related to
applying the guidance in SAB Topic 5M has established the ability to hold an
investment until it recovers its value as a required element in determining if
an individual security is other than temporarily impaired.  Based on
this clarification and as a result of NRC requirements that nuclear
decommissioning trusts be managed by independent investment managers, with
discretion to buy and sell securities in the trusts, PPL Susquehanna has
concluded that it is unable to demonstrate the ability to hold an impaired
security until it recovers its value.  Accordingly, unrealized losses
below cost of the securities represent other-than-temporary impairments and
require a current period charge to earnings.  Unrealized gains
continued to be recorded to OCI.  In 2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply
recorded a charge of $6 million ($3 million after tax, or $0.01 per share for
PPL) to reflect the cumulative impact of the other-than-temporary impairment of
affected securities.  Additional pre-tax charges of $36 million and $3
million for other-than-temporary impairments were recorded in 2008 and
2007.

Auction Rate
Securities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2008, auction rate securities were recorded in "Investments -
Other" on the Balance Sheet.  At December 31, 2007, auction rate
securities were recorded in "Short-term investments" on the Balance
Sheet.  See Note 18 for additional information on these
securities.

Historically,
the fair value of auction rate securities approximated their par value due to
the frequent resetting of the interest rates through the auction
process.  The auctions for these outstanding securities failed in the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, and PPL and PPL Energy Supply
continued to earn interest on these investments at contractually prescribed
interest rates.

At
December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of these auction rate
securities for PPL and PPL Energy Supply was $5 million lower than par
value.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply intend and have the ability to hold
these securities until they can be liquidated at par value.  Based
upon the evaluation of available information, PPL and PPL Energy Supply believe
these investments continue to be of high credit quality.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to fund
operations.  Based on this assessment, the declines in fair value were
deemed temporary due to general market conditions.  In 2008,
unrealized losses of $5 million for both PPL and PPL Energy Supply have been
recorded on these securities in OCI.  In 2007, no such unrealized
gains (losses) were recorded on these securities, as cost approximated fair
value.

Other

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
December 2008, the PEDFA issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of
Exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2008A and 2008B due 2038 (Series 2008
Bonds) on behalf of PPL Energy Supply.  PPL Investment Company, a
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, acted as the initial purchaser of the Series
2008 Bonds upon issuance.  PPL Energy Supply expects that the Series
2008 Bonds will be remarketed to unaffiliated investors in 2009, subject to
market conditions.  At December 31, 2008, these investments were
reflected in "Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheet.  No
unrealized gains (losses) were recorded in 2008 on these securities, as the
carrying value represented or approximated fair value.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In
October 2008, the PEDFA issued $90 million aggregate principal amount of
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2008 (PPL Electric Utilities
Corporation Project) due 2023 (PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds) on behalf of PPL
Electric.  PPL Electric acted as the initial purchaser of the PPL
Electric Series 2008 Bonds upon issuance.  PPL Electric remarketed the
PPL Electric Series 2008 Bonds to unaffiliated investors in November
2008.  No realized or unrealized gains (losses) were recorded in 2008
on these securities, as the carrying value represented or approximated fair
value.

24.

Variable Interest Entities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
December 2001, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a $455 million
operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development, construction and
operation of a gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility located in Lower Mt.
Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.  This generation
facility has a total capacity (winter rating) of 617 MW at December 31,
2008.  The owner/lessor of this generation facility, LMB Funding, LP,
was created to own/lease the facility and incur the related financing
costs.  The initial lease term commenced on the date of commercial
operation, which occurred in May 2004, and ends in December
2013.  Under a residual value guarantee, if the generation facility is
sold at the end of the lease term and the cash proceeds from the sale are less
than the original acquisition cost, the subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply is
obligated to pay up to 70.52% of the original acquisition cost.  This
residual value guarantee protects the other variable interest holders from
losses related to their investments.  As a result, LMB Funding, LP was
determined to be a variable interest entity and the subsidiary of PPL Energy
Supply was considered the primary beneficiary that consolidates this variable
interest entity.  The lease financing, which includes $437 million of
"Long-term Debt" and $18 million of "Minority Interest," at December 31, 2008,
is secured by, among other things, the generation facility.  The debt
matures at the end of the lease.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
facility, which was included in "Property, Plant and Equipment" and "Other
intangibles" on the Balance Sheets, had a carrying value of $441 million, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization of $51 million and $40
million.  The carrying value includes leasehold improvements of $61
million and $51 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007 that are not owned by the
variable interest entity.

Prior to
February 2007, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, WPD LLP, held a significant
variable interest in SIUK Capital Trust I; however, it was not consolidated
because WPD LLP was not the primary beneficiary.  SIUK Capital Trust I
issued $82 million of 8.23% preferred securities maturing in February 2027 and
invested the proceeds in 8.23% Subordinated Debentures maturing in February 2027
issued by SIUK Limited.  Thus, the preferred securities were supported
by a corresponding amount of subordinated debentures.  SIUK Limited
owned all of the common securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and guaranteed all of
SIUK Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities.  In
2003, SIUK Limited transferred its assets and liabilities, including the common
securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and the obligations under the subordinated
debentures, to WPD LLP. Therefore, WPD LLP guaranteed all of SIUK Capital Trust
I's obligations under the preferred securities.  In February 2007, WPD
LLP redeemed all of the 8.23% subordinated debentures due 2027 that were held by
SIUK Capital Trust I.  SIUK Capital Trust I was formally terminated in
May 2007.  See Note 16 for a discussion of the redemption of the
Subordinated Debentures in February 2007 and a discussion of the presentation of
the related party transactions.

25.

New Accounting Standards Pending Adoption

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

EITF
08-5

In
September 2008, the FASB issued EITF 08-5.  EITF 08-5 applies to
liabilities issued with an inseparable third-party credit enhancement when the
liability is measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring
basis.  An issuer shall disclose the existence of a third-party credit
enhancement, and the fair value measurement of the liability shall not include
the effect of this third-party credit enhancement.

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt EITF 08-5, prospectively, effective January 1, 2009.
While this guidance will impact PPL and its subsidiaries' fair value disclosure
of certain credit-enhanced debt instruments, it will not have a material impact
on the financial statements.

FSP
APB 14-1

In May
2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1.  FSP APB 14-1 requires an issuer
to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible
debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion
in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when
interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.  The discount that
results from separating the liability and equity components will be amortized
over the life of the debt and recognized as interest expense.

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt FSP APB 14-1 effective January 1,
2009.  Early adoption is not permitted.  Retrospective
application to all prior periods presented is required.  The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on periods prior to
those presented will be recognized as of the beginning of the first period
presented as an offsetting adjustment to opening retained earnings for that
period.

FSP APB
14-1 is applicable to PPL Energy Supply's 2-5/8% Convertible Senior Notes due
2023 (Convertible Senior Notes), which upon conversion required cash settlement
of the principal amount and permitted settlement of any conversion premium in
cash or PPL common stock.

During
2008, all of the Convertible Senior Notes were either converted at the election
of the holders or redeemed at par as a result of PPL Energy Supply calling the
notes for redemption.  See Note 8 for additional information about
these Convertible Senior Notes.  Upon adoption, FSP APB 14-1 will
require only retrospective application with regard to the Convertible Senior
Notes since none of these notes are outstanding.  The retrospective
application of this FSP will impact PPL in periods prior to 2006.  As
such, PPL expects to reduce the 2008 opening balance of "Earnings reinvested" by
$13 million with a corresponding increase to "Capital in excess of par value"
upon adoption effective January 1, 2009.

FSP
EITF 03-6-1

In June
2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1.  FSP EITF 03-6-1 addresses
whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are
participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in
the earnings allocation in computing EPS under the two-class method described in
SFAS 128.  FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires companies to include in the
computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method, unvested share-based
payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
equivalents.

FSP EITF
03-6-1 applies to restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under
PPL's stock-based compensation plans.

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt FSP EITF 03-6-1, retrospectively, effective January
1, 2009.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The
retrospective application of this FSP will not have a material impact on PPL and
its subsidiaries.

FSP
FAS 132(R)-1

In
December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, which amends SFAS 132(R) to
provide guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan assets of defined
benefit plans.  The objectives of the disclosures are to provide users
of financial statements with an understanding of:

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt FSP FAS 132(R)-1, prospectively, effective December
31, 2009.  FSP FAS 132(R)-1 was issued to provide greater transparency
within disclosures; therefore, the adoption is not expected to have a material
impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial statements.

SFAS
141(R)

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), which replaces SFAS
141.  PPL and its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 141(R), prospectively,
effective January 1, 2009.  The most significant changes to business
combination accounting pursuant to SFAS 141(R) includes requirements or
amendments to:

The
adoption of SFAS 141(R) will impact the accounting for business combinations for
which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009.  As noted
above, it will also impact all changes to tax uncertainties and income tax
valuation allowances established for business combinations that have occurred
prior to January 1, 2009.  Early adoption is
prohibited.  The January 1, 2009 adoption of SFAS 141(R) is not
expected to have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries; however, the
impact in periods subsequent to adoption could be material.

SFAS

See Note
1 for information regarding PPL and its subsidiaries' election to defer the
application of SFAS 157 for eligible nonfinancial assets and
liabilities.

SFAS

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160.  The objective of SFAS 160 is
to improve the relevancy, comparability, and transparency of the financial
information an entity provides when it has a noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary and when it deconsolidates a subsidiary.  SFAS 160 requires
that:

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 160, prospectively, effective January 1, 2009,
concurrent with the adoption of SFAS 141(R), except for the presentation and
disclosure requirements, which require retrospective application.  The
adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material impact on PPL and its
subsidiaries' financial statements.

SFAS

In March
2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, which applies to all derivative instruments,
including bifurcated derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to SFAS 133, as well
as related hedged items accounted for under SFAS 133.  SFAS 161 requires
entities to expand its disclosures to provide greater transparency about (a) how
and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments
and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and (c) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 161, prospectively, effective January 1,
2009.  SFAS 161 permits early adoption and encourages, but does not
require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
adoption.  SFAS 161 was issued to provide greater transparency by
enhancing existing disclosures; therefore, the adoption is not expected to have
a material impact on PPL and its subsidiaries' financial
statements.

26.
Cost Reduction Initiative

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On
February 24, 2009, PPL announced that a cost reduction initiative has resulted
in the elimination of approximately 200 management and staff positions across
PPL's domestic operations, or approximately 6% of PPL's non-union, domestic
workforce.  Most of the affected employees have been
separated.

As a
result of the workforce reductions, PPL will record a one-time after-tax charge
of between $12 and $15 million, or $0.03 to $0.04 per share, for the three
months ended March 31, 2009.  The costs to be incurred by PPL will consist
primarily of enhanced pension and severance benefits under PPL’s Pension and
Separation Policy.

As a
result of the workforce reduction, PPL Energy Supply will record a one-time
after-tax charge of between $7 and $9 million for the three months ended March
31, 2009.  Included in the charge is an allocation of the costs
associated with the elimination of positions at PPL Services.

As a
result of the workforce reduction, PPL Electric will record a one-time after-tax
charge of between $5 and $6 million for the three months ended March 31,
2009.  Included in the charge is an allocation of the costs

associated with the

elimination
of positions at PPL Services.

(a)

Primarily
      related to uncollectible accounts written-off.

(b)

Partially
      related to the reductions of reserves established for receivables from
      Enron.

(c)

Primarily
      related to the change in foreign net operating loss carryforwards
      including the change in foreign currency exchange
  rates.

(a)

Quarterly
      results can vary depending on, among other things, weather and the forward
      pricing of power.  In addition, earnings in 2008 and 2007 were
      affected by special items.  Accordingly, comparisons among
      quarters of a year may not be indicative of overall trends and changes in
      operations.

(b)

The
      sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal annual earnings per share due
      to changes in the number of common shares outstanding during the year or
      rounding.

(c)

PPL
      has paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock in every year since
      1946.  Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board
      of Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows,
      financial requirements and other
factors.

(a)

Quarterly
      results can vary depending on, among other things, weather and the forward
      pricing of power.  In addition, earnings in 2008 and 2007 were
      affected by special items.  Accordingly, comparisons among
      quarters of a year may not be indicative of overall trends and changes in
      operations.

(a)

PPL
      Electric's business is seasonal in nature, with peak sales periods
      generally occurring in the winter and summer months.  In
      addition, earnings in 2007 were affected by a special
      item.  Accordingly, comparisons among quarters of a year may not
      be indicative of overall trends and changes in
  operations.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE

PPL
Corporation, PPL Energy Supply, LLC and PPL Electric Utilities
Corporation

None.

Management
      of PPL's non-accelerated filer companies, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
      Electric, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
      Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  PPL's internal control over financial
      reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's
      management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
      control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
      misstatements.

Under
      the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
      our principal executive officers and principal financial officers, we
      conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal Control -
      Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under the
      framework in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework," our management
      concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
      as of December 31, 2008.  This annual report does not include an
      attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the companies' independent
      registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over
      financial reporting.  Management's report was not subject to
      attestation by the companies' registered public accounting firm pursuant
      to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
      the companies to provide only management's report in this annual
      report.

Approval of Fees

The Audit Committee of
PPL has procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided
by the independent auditor.  The procedures are designed to ensure the
continued independence of the independent auditor.  More specifically,
the use of the independent auditor to perform either audit or non-audit services
is prohibited unless specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee of
PPL.  As a result of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL
has established specific categories of services and authorization
levels.  All services outside of the specified categories and all
amounts exceeding the authorization levels are reviewed by the Chair of the
Audit Committee of PPL, who serves as the Committee designee to review and
approve audit and non-audit related services during the year.  A
listing of the approved audit and non-audit services is reviewed with the full
Audit Committee of PPL no later than its next meeting.

The Audit
Committee of PPL approved 100% of the 2008 and 2007 services provided by
EY.
