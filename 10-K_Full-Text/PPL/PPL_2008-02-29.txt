EnergyPlus purchases electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level, and
also sells electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level under FERC
market-based tariffs.  PPL EnergyPlus enters into these agreements to
market available energy and capacity from PPL Generation's assets and to profit
from market price fluctuations.  PPL EnergyPlus actively manages its
portfolios to maximize the value of PPL's generating assets and to limit
exposure to price fluctuations.  PPL EnergyPlus also purchases and
sells energy forward and futures contracts as well as other commodity-based

Pennsylvania Delivery
      Segment -

Includes
      the regulated electric and gas delivery operations of PPL Electric and PPL
      Gas Utilities.

PPL
      Electric

PPL
Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a
10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  The largest cities in this territory are Allentown,
Bethlehem, Harrisburg, Hazleton, Lancaster, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and
Williamsport.

In
addition to delivering electricity in its service territory in Pennsylvania, PPL
Electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory
as a PLR.  As part of the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric agreed to
supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through
2009.  PPL Electric has executed two contracts to purchase electricity
from PPL EnergyPlus sufficient for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates.  PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009 will be determined by the PUC pursuant to PLR regulations
and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those
regulations.  Both the regulations and the policy statement became
effective in September 2007.  Refer to "Power Supply" for additional
information, as well as Notes 15 and 16 to the Financial
Statements.

During
2007, about 95% of PPL Electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated
electricity delivery and supply as a PLR.  About 5% of 2007 operating
revenues were from wholesale sales, primarily the sale to PPL EnergyPlus of
power purchased from NUGs.  During 2007, about 43% of electricity
delivery and PLR revenues were from residential customers, 37% from commercial
customers, 19% from industrial customers and 1% from other customer
classes.

PPL
Electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of PJM, which operates
the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-Atlantic
and Midwest regions of the U.S.  Bulk electricity is transmitted to
wholesale users throughout a geographic area including all or part of Delaware,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia.  As of January 1, 2006, PPL Electric became a member of the
RFC.  The purpose of the RFC is to preserve and enhance electric
service reliability and security for the interconnected electric systems within
its territory and to be a regional entity under the framework of the
NERC.  The RFC's key functions are the development of regional
standards for reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and
non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both NERC and
regional standards.

PJM
serves as a FERC-approved RTO in order to accommodate greater competition and
broader participation in the region.  An RTO, like an ISO, is a
designation provided by the FERC to a FERC-approved independent entity that
operates the transmission system and typically administers a competitive power
market.  PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity
and ancillary services.  A primary purpose of the RTO/ISO is to
separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market
participants that buy or sell electricity in the same
markets.  Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets,
but the RTO/ISO directs the control and operation of the transmission
facilities.  PPL Electric is entitled to fully recover from retail
customers the charges that it pays to PJM for transmission-related
services.  PJM imposes these charges pursuant to its FERC-approved
Open Access Transmission Tariff.

PPL
Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain of
its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal
Power Act.

PPL
Electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state
and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental
matters.  Certain operations of PPL Electric are subject to the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and comparable state
statutes.

In
November 2004, Pennsylvania enacted the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards
legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as PPL
Electric, and electric generation suppliers serving retail load to ultimately
provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania from
alternative sources within 15 years (by 2020).  Under this new state
legislation, alternative sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal,
landfill methane and fuel cells.  An electric distribution company
will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 for each MWh that it is short
of its required alternative energy supply percentage.  Since PPL
Electric's PLR generation rates are capped through 2009 as described above and
the legislation allows for a cost recovery exemption period, PPL Electric will
not be subject to the requirements of this legislation until 2010.  In
that year, PPL Electric will have to supply about 9% of the total amount of
electricity it delivers to its PLR customers from alternative energy
sources.  At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the impact of this
legislation on its future results of operations because the impact will depend
on a number of factors that will not be known until 2010, including customer
load requirements, PLR contract terms and available alternative energy sources
in the market.

In
February 2007, the Governor of Pennsylvania announced an Energy Independence
Strategy (Strategy).  The Strategy included initiatives aimed at
encouraging the development of energy conservation, energy management and
alternative energy resources and proposed the creation of an $850 million Energy
Independence Fund (Fund) to support the Strategy objectives through rebates,
grants and loans to qualifying programs.  The Fund would be
capitalized with revenue bonds and financed through a non-bypassable charge on
retail electric bills.  The Strategy also included three
initiatives to address PLR issues, such as a proposal to phase-in over three
years any initial generation rate increase approved by the PUC and a requirement
that PLR providers obtain a "least cost portfolio" of supply by purchasing power
in the spot market and through contracts of varying
lengths.  Additionally, providers would be required to procure energy
conservation resources before acquiring additional power to meet load
growth.  In addition, PLR providers could enter into long-term
contracts with large energy users and alternative energy
developers.  A special legislative session on energy issues began in
September 2007 and is continuing in 2008.  The announcement of this
Strategy and the special legislative session are the first steps in an expected
long legislative process involving all of the affected
stakeholders.  In 2007 and 2008, numerous bills have been introduced
on issues incorporated in or related to those addressed by the Strategy,
including demand-side management measures.  It is uncertain at this
time whether the details of implementing the Strategy, including the issues of
deferral of costs and recovery of interest for the customer rate phase-in
program and the timing of PUC approval for PLR supply portfolios, will be
included in legislation or delegated to the PUC.  At this time, PPL
cannot predict the final outcome of this legislative and regulatory process or
its ultimate impact.  See PPL's "Results of Operations - Segment
Results - Pennsylvania Delivery Segment - 2008 Outlook" in Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for
additional information regarding PPL Electric's efforts to provide default
electricity supply for periods after 2009.

PPL Gas
      Utilities

PPL Gas
Utilities was formed in 1946, and PPL acquired it in 1998.  PPL Gas
Utilities operates a natural gas distribution and propane business in portions
of various counties in Pennsylvania, as well as in a small area of Maryland and
Delaware, providing natural gas and propane services to approximately 110,000
customers.  PPL Gas Utilities provides natural gas services in
Pennsylvania subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC.  PPL
Gas Utilities also provides intrastate and interstate natural gas storage
service from storage fields in Pennsylvania.  The intrastate storage
service is regulated by the PUC and the interstate storage service is regulated
by the FERC.  However, under a 1992 FERC Order, rates for interstate
storage services are the rates set by the PUC for intrastate
service.  The propane delivery service is not subject to the
regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC or the FERC.

In July
2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for PPL Gas Utilities and
announced its intention to sell these businesses.  PPL expects the
sale to be completed in the second half of 2008, following execution of a sales
agreement and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.  See Note 10
to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Â·

International Delivery
      Segment -

Includes
      WPD, a regulated electricity distribution company in the
    U.K.

WPD,
through indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, operates two electric distribution
companies that together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users in the
U.K.  WPD (South West) serves 1.5 million customers from Bristol to
Bath in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest England.  WPD (South
Wales) serves an area of Wales opposite the Bristol Channel from WPD (South
West)'s territory.  Its 1.1 million customers occupy 4,550 square
miles of Wales.

PPL
Global had controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution
companies serving customers in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia until their
respective sales in 2007.  In March 2007, PPL completed a review of
strategic options for its Latin American businesses and announced its intention
to sell them.  In May 2007, PPL completed the sale of its El
Salvadoran business, DelSur, for $180 million in cash.  In July 2007,
PPL sold its Bolivian businesses, Elfec and Integra, to a group organized by
local management and employees of the companies.  In November 2007,
PPL completed the sale of its entire interest in its Chilean business, Emel, for
$660 million in cash.  These Latin American businesses had served
approximately 1.1 million customers.  See Note 10 to the Financial
Statements for additional information on these sales.

Seasonality

Demand
for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather.  As a
result, PPL's overall operating results in the future may fluctuate
substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather
conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more
pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on
the nature and location of the facilities PPL owns and the terms of the
contracts to purchase or sell electricity.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION

See
PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this
information.

CAPITAL
EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

See
"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in PPL's, PPL Energy
Supply's and PPL Electric's "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning
estimated capital expenditure requirements for the years
2008-2012.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
information concerning expected capital expenditures for environmental
matters.

COMPETITION

The
unregulated businesses and markets in which PPL and its subsidiaries participate
are highly competitive.  Over the last 15 years, there has been
increased competition in U.S. energy markets because of federal and state
deregulation initiatives.  For instance, in 1992, the Energy Act
amended the Federal Power Act to provide open access to electric transmission
systems for wholesale transactions.  In 1996, the Customer Choice Act
was enacted in Pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry
to create a competitive market for electricity generation.  Certain
other states in which PPL's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer
choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity
supplier.  PPL and its subsidiaries believe that competition in
deregulated energy markets will continue to be intense.  See "Item 1A.
Risk Factors" for more information concerning the risks PPL faces with respect
to competition in the deregulated energy markets.

Pursuant
to PPL Electric's authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service
area.  Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its
distribution business.  Although WPD operates in non-exclusive
concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little or no competition with
respect to residential customers.  See "Franchises and Licenses" for
more information.

POWER
SUPPLY

PPL
Generation's system capacity (winter rating) at December 31, 2007 was
11,418 MW.  The capacity of generating units is based upon a number of
factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units,
and may be revised periodically to reflect changed circumstances.  See
"Item 2. Properties" for a description of PPL Generation's plants at
December 31, 2007.

During
2007, PPL Generation's plants generated the following amounts of
electricity.

This
generation represented a 2% increase above the output for 2006.  Of
this generation, 56% of the energy was generated by coal-fired stations, 31%
from nuclear operations at the Susquehanna station, 8% from hydroelectric
stations and 5% from oil/gas-fired stations.

PPL
estimates that, on average, approximately 91% of its expected annual generation
output for the period 2008 through 2009 will be used to meet:

Â·

PPL
      EnergyPlus' obligation under two contracts to provide electricity for PPL
      Electric to satisfy its PLR obligation under the Customer Choice Act
      through 2009;

Â·

PPL
      EnergyPlus' obligation under contracts to provide electricity to
      NorthWestern; and

Â·

contractual
      sales to other counterparties for terms of various
  lengths.

PPL has
started to and will continue to enter into new power sales contracts over the
next few years to obtain firm commitments for a portion of the output of its
generating facilities, in advance of the expiration of the PLR
contracts.  PPL has already entered into commitments of varying
quantities and terms for the years 2010 and beyond.  Based on
developments in the wholesale markets over the last several years, PPL expects
that new baseload output contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter
duration than the PLR contracts which, at inception, had terms of approximately
nine years.

These
contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are integral to, PPL's supply
business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse
movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit
risk.  This strategy includes matching PPL's anticipated energy supply
(including generation as well as purchase commitments) with load, or customer
demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy
counterparties.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more
information regarding PPL's wholesale energy commitments and Note 16 for more
information regarding the PLR contracts.

A
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply funds, develops, constructs, owns and operates
plants that produce renewable energy.  PPL EnergyPlus markets the
energy produced by these plants and renewable energy credits to commercial,
industrial and institutional customers.

Another
subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply has existing projects throughout Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with capacity of approximately 23
MW.  During 2007, these projects generated 44 million
kWh.  PPL EnergyPlus purchases the output from two wind farms in
Pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 MW.  A subsidiary of PPL
Energy Supply plans to invest at least $100 million in new renewable projects
through 2011.  In addition, PPL Generation is planning to expand by
156 MW the renewable energy provided by hydroelectric facilities.  The
cost of this expansion is expected to be $544 million.

FUEL
SUPPLY

Coal and Synthetic
Fuel

Pennsylvania

Through
December 31, 2007, PPL Coal Supply, LLC (PPL Coal Supply) provided coal to Iris
Energy LLC (Iris Energy) for the production of synthetic fuel.  In
2007, synthetic fuel from Iris Energy provided 66% of the fuel requirements for
three Pennsylvania power plants operated by PPL Generation.  The
contract to provide coal to Iris Energy and the contract for Iris Energy to
supply synthetic fuel to PPL Generation, along with the IRS synthetic fuel tax
credit program, terminated on December 31, 2007.  As part of that
termination, PPL purchased Iris Energy's membership interest in PPL Coal Supply
for $7 million.  PPL Generation's coal supply costs are expected to
increase by approximately $20 million in 2008 as a result of the synthetic fuel
supply contract ending.

Effective
December 31, 2007, PPL Coal Supply, which provided the balance of the
Pennsylvania plants' coal requirements, was merged into PPL
Generation.  PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus,
actively manages PPL's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from
mines located in central and northern Appalachia.

During
2007, PPL Coal Supply purchased about 92% of the coal delivered to PPL
Generation's wholly-owned Pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term
contracts and obtained 8% through spot market purchases.  These
contracts provided PPL Generation about 7.0 million tons of
coal.  Contracts currently in place are expected to provide
approximately 7.3 million tons in 2008.  At December 31, 2007, the
wholly-owned Pennsylvania plants had sufficient supply for about 31 days of
operations.  The amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time
depending on market conditions and plant operations.

In 2006,
PPL Generation, by and through its agent PPL EnergyPlus, entered into a
long-term coal purchase agreement with CONSOL Energy Inc.  The
contract will provide more than one-third of PPL Generation's projected annual
coal needs for the Pennsylvania power plants from 2010 through
2018.  PPL Generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide
additional coal supply for PPL's projected annual needs from 2008 through
2012.

Also at
December 31, 2007, a PPL Generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in the
Keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the Conemaugh station.  The
owners of the Keystone station had a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel
supplier, which terminated at the end of 2007, and provided 4.4 million tons in
2007.  The Keystone station contracts with Keystone Fuels, LLC for the
balance of its requirements.  The owners of the Conemaugh station also
had a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel supplier, which terminated at the
end of 2007 and provided 2.6 million tons in 2007.  The balance of the
Conemaugh station requirements is purchased under contract from Conemaugh Fuels,
LLC.  PPL's share of Keystone and Conemaugh coal supply costs are
expected to increase by $4 million in 2008 due to termination of the synthetic
fuel contracts.

Initial
deliveries of limestone in preparation for startup of the scrubbers being
installed at the Montour power plant began in October 2007.  Contracts
are in place for all the limestone requirements for the four planned scrubbers
at PPL Generation's wholly-owned Pennsylvania stations for 2008 through
2010.  When all four scrubbers are fully operational, it is projected
that annual limestone requirements will be approximately 700,000
tons.

Montana

PPL
Montana has a 50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 30%
leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit 3.  PPL Montana, along with the
other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements
with defined quality characteristics and specifications.  The current
coal supply contract for Units 1 and 2 is in effect through December 31,
2009.  In 2007, PPL Montana entered into a new long-term purchase and
supply agreement with the current supplier for Units 1 and 2 that will begin
January 1, 2010.  The new contract will provide these units with 100%
of the coal requirements through December 31, 2014, and at least 85% of such
requirements from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019.  The coal
supply contract for Unit 3 is in effect through December 31, 2019, and will
provide 100% of the coal requirements of this unit.

Coal
supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality
characteristics and specifications for PPL Montana's Corette
station.  The contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements
in 2007.  Similar contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of
the expected coal requirements through 2010.

Oil and Natural
Gas

PPL
Generation's Martins Creek Units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural
gas.  PPL EnergyPlus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural
gas supply for all PPL Generation operations.  During 2007, 100% of
the physical oil and gas requirements for the Martins Creek units were purchased
on the spot market.  As of December 31, 2007, PPL EnergyPlus had no
long-term agreements for these oil requirements.

As of
December 31, 2007, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to
purchase natural gas for the University Park facility.

PPL
EnergyPlus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected
pipeline transportation requirements of the Wallingford facility, but has no
long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas.

PPL
EnergyPlus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place
for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the Lower Mt. Bethel
facility, but has no long-term supply agreement to purchase natural
gas.

Nuclear

The
nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service
components:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium
concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a
gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel
assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage
and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

PPL
Susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates,
for nuclear fuel materials and services.  These contracts are expected
to provide sufficient fuel to permit Unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of
2012 and Unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2013.  PPL
Susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued
operation of the nuclear units.

Federal
law requires the federal government to provide for the permanent disposal of
commercial spent nuclear fuel.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
(NWPA), the DOE initiated an analysis of a site in Nevada for a permanent
nuclear waste repository.  There is no definitive date by which this
repository will be operational.  As a result, it was necessary to
expand Susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity.  To support
this expansion, PPL Susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a
spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage
technology.  The facility is modular, so that additional storage
capacity can be added as needed.  The facility began receiving spent
nuclear fuel in 1999.  PPL Susquehanna estimates that there is
sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site
spent fuel storage facility at Susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged
through approximately 2017, under current operating
conditions.  If necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can
be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that,
together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will
accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current
licensed life of the plant.

In 2002,
President Bush approved the Congressional override of a veto by the State of
Nevada, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the site for development of a
permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste.  The next step
is for the DOE to submit a license application to the NRC to build and then
operate the Yucca Mountain repository.  The DOE currently plans to
submit a license application by the end of 2008.

In 1996,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the
NWPA imposed on the DOE an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent
nuclear fuel on or before January 31, 1998.  In 1997, the Court ruled
that the contracts between the utilities and the DOE provide a potentially
adequate remedy if the DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by
January 31, 1998.  The DOE did not, in fact, begin to accept spent
nuclear fuel on that date.  The DOE continues to contest claims that
its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages.  In January
2004, PPL Susquehanna filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for
unspecified damages suffered as a result of the DOE's breach of its contract to
accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  PPL cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings.

PROVIDER
OF LAST RESORT SUPPLY

The
Customer Choice Act requires electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric,
to act as a PLR of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will
be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure
default electricity supply in 2010 -- after its current supply agreements with
PPL EnergyPlus expire -- for retail customers who do not choose an alternative
competitive supplier.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric has
completed two of six competitive supply solicitations and has contracted for
one-third of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential,
small commercial and small industrial customers.  See PPL's "Results
of Operations - Segment Results - Pennsylvania Delivery Segment - 2008 Outlook"
in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," for additional information regarding PPL Electric's
efforts to provide default electricity supply for periods after
2009.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

Certain
PPL subsidiaries, including PPL Electric and PPL Generation subsidiaries, are
subject to certain present and developing federal, regional, state and local
laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other
environmental matters.  See PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's "Financial
Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information
concerning environmental expenditures during 2007 and estimated expenditures
during 2008-2012.  Certain environmental laws, regulations and
developments that may have a substantial impact on PPL are discussed
below.  See "Environmental Matters" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for information regarding these laws and regulations and the status
of PPL's and its subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as
legal and regulatory proceedings involving PPL and its
subsidiaries.

Air

The Clean
Air Act includes, among other things, provisions that:  (a) restrict
the construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and
substantially modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b)
authorize the EPA to impose substantial per day noncompliance penalties for each
facility found to be in violation of the requirements of an applicable state
implementation plan.  State agencies administer the EPA's air quality
regulations through state implementation plans and have concurrent authority to
impose penalties for noncompliance.

In 2005,
the EPA finalized its Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) requiring substantial
reductions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions in 28 midwestern and
eastern states, including Pennsylvania.  Pursuant to a separate rule
finalized in 2005, the EPA also required mercury reductions
nationwide.  However, a federal appeals court has negated the EPA
mercury rule.  The ruling is not expected to affect PPL's current
plans to comply with state regulations in Pennsylvania and
Montana.  PPL continues to review the federal court opinion to
determine whether it has any effect on state regulations in the long
term.

Global Climate
Change

There is
a growing concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and
the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly,
carbon dioxide.  This concern has led to increased federal legislative
proposals, actions at state or local levels, as well as litigation relating to
greenhouse gas emissions, including an April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision
holding that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from
new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA has also agreed,
following this decision, to a remand of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)
applicable to stationary sources to reconsider its approach to including
greenhouse gases under such rules.  If the EPA concludes greenhouse
gases from motor vehicles pose an endangerment to public health or welfare, this
could lead to regulation of stationary source carbon dioxide
emissions.  The EPA might also proceed directly under the NSPS to
regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources.  Also, increased
pressure for carbon dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by investor
and environmental organizations and the international community.  In
addition, a nuisance claim brought by a number of states against other large
electric generating companies was dismissed by a federal district court in New
York but remains pending on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.

PPL
believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material
impact on its capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not now
determinable.

PPL also
cannot predict the impact that any pending or future federal or state
legislation regarding more stringent environmental standards could have on PPL
or its subsidiaries.

Water

To
implement the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972,
as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987, the
EPA has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric
stations.  The states administer the EPA's effluent standards through
state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges
and water quality.  The standards adopted by the EPA pursuant to the
Clean Water Act may have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain
PPL subsidiaries, depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments
to regulations.  The EPA plans to finalize the 2008 Effluent
Guidelines Plan by August 2008, in which the EPA will make a decision about
whether to revise the steam electric effluent guidelines.  The EPA is
presently conducting a sampling study of industry discharges to obtain
information needed to make that decision.

As a
result of a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision in January
2007, the EPA has withdrawn and is revising its rules for reducing the adverse
impact to aquatic organisms during operation of cooling water intakes at
existing facilities.  While the EPA revises the rule, some states are
moving forward to independently implement this section of the Clean Water
Act.  Changes the EPA will make to the rule in accordance with this
decision and the actions of states will likely result in requirements to install
technologies to reduce the impact to aquatic life.  The cost of these
technologies is not now determinable but could be significant.

Pursuant
to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977, the OSM has adopted effluent
guidelines which are applicable to PPL subsidiaries as a result of their past
coal mining and coal processing activities.  The EPA and the OSM
limitations, guidelines and standards also are enforced through the issuance of
NPDES permits.  In accordance with the provisions of the Clean Water
Act and the Reclamation Act of 1977, the EPA and the OSM have authorized the
states to implement the NPDES program.  Compliance with applicable
water quality standards is assured by state imposition of NPDES permit
conditions and requirements to address acid mine drainage.

Solid and Hazardous
Waste

The
provisions of Superfund authorize the EPA to require past and present owners of
contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site to
clean-up the site or pay the EPA or the state for the costs of
clean-up.  The generators and past owners can be liable even if the
generator contributed only a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the
site.  Present owners can be liable even if they contributed no
hazardous substances to the site.

State
laws such as the Pennsylvania and Montana Superfund statutes and the
Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act also give state agencies broad authority
to identify contaminated sites or sites with waste that has been improperly
disposed of, and to order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the
sites.  If responsible parties cannot or will not perform the
clean-up, the agency can hire contractors to clean-up the sites and then require
reimbursement from the responsible parties after the clean-up is
completed.  Another Pennsylvania statute, the Land Recycling and
Environmental Remediation Standards, encourages voluntary clean-ups by allowing
responsible parties to choose from a menu of clean-up standards and providing
liability protection commensurate with the clean-up standard
chosen.

Furthermore,
the EPA and several states, including Montana, are considering establishing
regulations that could impact the disposal and management of coal combustion
products including ash and scrubber wastes and other by-products.  PPL
cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, such regulations would have on
its operating facilities.

Certain
federal and state statutes, including federal and state Superfund statutes, also
impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged
natural resources.

Low-Level Radioactive
Waste

Under
federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive
waste generated in that state.  States may join in regional compacts
to jointly fulfill their responsibilities.  The states of
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia are members of the
Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.  Efforts to
develop a regional disposal facility in Pennsylvania were suspended by the
Pennsylvania DEP in 1998.  The Commonwealth retains the legal
authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it be
necessary.  Low-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation
of the Susquehanna facility is currently being sent to independently operated
facilities in Barnwell, South Carolina, and Clive, Utah for
disposal.  In the event these or other emergent disposal options
become unavailable or are no longer cost-effective, low-level radioactive waste
will be stored on-site at Susquehanna, in a facility licensed for that purpose
by the NRC.  The Barnwell facility has announced that it will stop
receiving waste from most states, including Pennsylvania, in June
2008.  Beginning at that time, PPL will send most of its low-level
radioactive waste to the Clive, Utah facility and the remainder will be stored
at the Susquehanna storage facility.  PPL Susquehanna cannot predict
the future availability of independently operated low-level waste disposal
facilities or the cost of disposal at such facilities.  PPL believes
that its licensed storage facility located at Susquehanna is sufficient for the
foreseeable future to replace the portion of storage capability at the Barnwell
facility that will not be shifted to Clive, Utah.

Electric and Magnetic
Fields

Concerns
have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
substation equipment.  Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K.
have reviewed this issue.  The U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes,
there is no evidence that EMFs cause adverse effects.  The agency
further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with
childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without
supporting laboratory evidence.  The U.K. National Radiological
Protection Board (part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded in 2004
that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that EMFs
cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
existing exposure guidelines.  In April 2007, the Stakeholder Group on
Extremely Low Frequency EMF, set up by the U.K. Government, issued its interim
assessment, which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to
EMFs.  This assessment is being considered by the U.K.
Government. PPL and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to
determine whether EMFs cause adverse health effects should continue and are
taking steps to reduce EMFs, where practical, in the design of new transmission
and distribution facilities.  PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to
predict what effect, if any, the EMF issue might have on their operations and
facilities either in the U.S. or the U.K., and the associated cost, or what, if
any, liabilities they might incur related to the EMF issue.

General

PPL and
its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving
environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities
and operations.  In complying with statutes, regulations and actions
by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of
water and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic
substances, PPL's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease
operating certain of their facilities.  PPL's subsidiaries may also
incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which
are not now determinable, but could be significant.

FRANCHISES
AND LICENSES

PPL
Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its
service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in
corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies to which it has succeeded and
as a result of certification by the PUC.  PPL Electric is granted the
right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain
conditions.  In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance,
resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local
political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

See
"Background - Supply Segment" for a discussion of PPL EnergyPlus' licenses in
various states.  PPL EnergyPlus also has an export license from the
DOE to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in Canada.

PPL
Susquehanna operates Units 1 and 2 pursuant to NRC operating
licenses.  In September 2006, PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for
20-year license renewals for each of the Susquehanna units to extend their
expiration dates, from 2022 to 2042 for Unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit
2.  PPL cannot predict whether or when NRC approval will be
obtained.

In
December 2007, PPL announced that PPL Susquehanna will ask the NRC to approve a
COLA for a new nuclear generating unit to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna
plant.  See Note 9 to Financial Statements for additional
information.

PPL
Holtwood operates the Holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a
license renewed by the FERC in 1980 and expiring in 2014.  PPL
Holtwood operates the Wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to
a license renewed by the FERC in 2005 and expiring in 2044.  PPL
Holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of Safe Harbor Water Power
Corporation (Safe Harbor), which holds a project license that extends the
operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030.  The
total capacity of the Safe Harbor generating station is 420 MW, and PPL Holtwood
is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity.

In
December 2007, PPL asked the FERC for permission to expand its Holtwood plant by
125 MW.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

The 11
hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from Montana Power
in 1999 are licensed by the FERC.  These licenses expire periodically,
and the generating facilities must be relicensed at such times.  The
current FERC license for the Mystic facility expires in 2009; the Thompson Falls
and Kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for
the nine Missouri-Madison facilities expire in 2040.  In December
2007, the FERC issued a new license for the Mystic facility for a 40-year term,
effective January 1, 2010.

In
connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, the FERC may,
under applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee,
or the U.S. government may take over the facility.  If the original
licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the
facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable
damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing.

WPD is
located in the U.K. and is authorized by the U.K. government to provide electric
distribution services within its concession areas and service territories,
subject to certain conditions and obligations.  For instance, WPD is
subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality
of service it must provide, and WPD can be fined or even have its licenses
revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.

WPD
operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by
Ofgem.  The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue
is normally determined every five years.  The most recent review was
completed in late-2004, and new prices became effective April 1,
2005.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric face various risks associated with our
businesses.  While we have tried to identify below the risks we
currently consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we
face.  Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently
deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  Our
businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  In addition,
this report also contains forward-looking and other statements that involve a
number of risks and uncertainties.  See "Forward-Looking Information,"
"Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks,
uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial
results.

As used
in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to PPL and its
consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to PPL Energy Supply and its
consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Supply and International
Delivery segment discussions, or PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities and their
consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Delivery
segment discussion.

Risks
Related to Supply Segment

(

PPL and PPL Energy
Supply

)

Adverse
changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy
margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Our
energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power
exceed our costs of supplying power, are impacted by changes in the market
prices for electricity, as well as fluctuations in the prices for fuel, fuel
transportation, emission allowances, renewable energy credits, electricity
transmission and related congestion charges and other costs.  Unlike
most other commodities, there is limited ability to store electric power and it
must be consumed at the time of production.  As a result, the
wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over
relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.  Among the
factors that can influence such prices are:

See
Exhibit 99(b) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in
wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five
years.

Whether
we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power
sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements in order to mitigate
market price and supply risk may affect our earnings.

As a
result of the PLR contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion
of our anticipated generation production and capacity value is currently
committed through 2009 under power sales agreements of various terms that
include fixed prices for our electric power.  In connection with such
agreements, we have entered into longer-term fuel purchase and fuel
transportation agreements that include fixed prices for a significant portion of
our forecasted needs.  Whether we decide to, or are able to, continue
to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements and the market
conditions at that time will affect our financial performance.  For
instance, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would sell the
energy, capacity and other products from our facilities into the competitive
wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current
market prices.

Although the current
forward prices for electricity significantly exceed the prices available under
some of our current power sales agreements, this situation may not
continue.  In addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel
purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our power generation facilities,
our fuel costs (and the associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed the
revenues that we derive from our energy sales.  Given the volatility
and potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and
fuel and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity
sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be
subject to increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel
costs (and the associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may
be materially adversely affected.

Marketing
energy for the period after expiration of the PLR contracts poses other risks to
the Supply segment.

The
existing full requirements PLR contracts between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric
expire at the end of 2009.  In connection with PPL Electricâs
PUC-approved procurement plan for default electricity supply in 2010 for retail
customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier, PPL EnergyPlus
was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive solicitation process
and in July 2007 entered into an agreement with PPL Electric to supply up to 671
MW of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42 per
MWh.  At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which PPL
EnergyPlus will sell additional power to PPL Electric after 2009.  In
anticipation of the expiration of the PLR contracts at the end of 2009, our
energy marketing and trading operation continues to enter into other new supply
contracts for the post-2009 period, including bilateral and load-following
contracts with new counterparties at market prices.

The electricity
supply obligations under these new contracts will be met by generation we own
and electricity and other energy-related products purchased from other
parties.  In connection with these activities and as part of the
continued expansion of our energy marketing and trading operation, we are
hedging the future energy production capability of our generation facilities and
the related fuel costs; buying and selling energy, capacity, fuel, transmission
and other products in the wholesale energy markets; and entering into various
forms of financial and physical contracts to capture additional energy margins
as well as to hedge various exposures in our generation portfolio and generally
manage risk.  All of the above hedging and trading activity may cause
volatility in future cash flows and results of operations.

Disruptions
in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability to
operate our generation facilities.

We
purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Disruption in the delivery
of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation
difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental
regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely
affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales
and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of
operations.

Our
generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our
expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our
financial performance.

Our
ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is
critical to our financial performance.  Operation of our power plants
at expected capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or
failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel
interruption.  In addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt
our generation plants.  Weather conditions also have a direct impact
on the river flows required to operate our hydroelectric plants at expected
capacity levels.  Depending on the timing and duration of both planned
and unplanned complete or partial outages at our power plants (in particular, if
such outages are during peak periods or during periods of, or caused by, severe
weather), our revenues from energy sales could be significantly decreased and
our expenses significantly increased, and we could be required to purchase power
at then-current market prices to satisfy our energy sales commitments or, in the
alternative, pay penalties and damages for our failure to satisfy
them.  Many of our generating units are reaching mid-life, and we are
faced with the potential for more frequent unplanned outages and the possibility
of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in
major component replacements at these facilities.

Changes
in technology may impair the value of our power plants.

A basic
premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants
achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low
price.  There are alternate technologies for producing electricity,
most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar)
cells.  Research and development activities are ongoing to seek
improvements in the alternate technologies.  It is possible that
advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electric production to a
level that is equal to or below that of most central station electric
production.  Also, as new technologies are developed and become
available, the quantity and the pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by
customers could change, thus allowing them to reduce their purchases and the
corresponding revenues that the generators receive.  If this were to
happen, the value of our generation facilities may be significantly
impaired.

We
rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to
deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas.  If transmission is
disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our
ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered.

We depend
on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and
other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to the
wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric
generation facilities.  If transmission is disrupted (as a result of
weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by
ISOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell
and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or
we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms.

The FERC
has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to
be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis.  Although
these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access
to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission
capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we
desire.  We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result
of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific
markets or whether ISOs in applicable markets will operate the transmission
networks, and provide related services, efficiently.

The
PLR contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply and demand
significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy
margins.

PPL
Electric is obligated to provide electricity supply to its PLR customers at
predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into PUC-approved, full
requirements energy supply agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at the rates PPL
Electric is entitled to charge its PLR customers in order to fulfill its PLR
obligation.  If PPL Electric's customers obtain electricity from
alternate suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, PPL EnergyPlus'
sales of electricity under the PLR contracts may decrease.

Alternatively,
demand that we satisfy pursuant to the PLR contracts could increase as a result
of severe weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over which
we have no control.  We satisfy our electricity supply obligations
through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation
assets, contractual relationships and market purchases.

At December 31, 2007,
the PLR requirements required about 80% of the normal operating capacity of our
existing Pennsylvania generation assets

.

A significant
increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins because we are
required under the terms of the PLR contracts to provide the energy supply to
fulfill this increased demand at the capped rates, which we expect to remain
significantly below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase the
additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at
which we could otherwise sell the additional supply.  Accordingly, any
significant increase in demand could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial position.

We
face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely
affect our ability to operate profitably.

Unlike
our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured of
any rate of return on our capital investments through predetermined rates, and
our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our ability to operate
in a competitive environment.  An important focus of our supply
business over the next several years will be the enhancement and expansion of
our wholesale marketing and trading of electricity and related products and
services, but we may not be successful because of the intense competition that
we face in the deregulated electricity markets.  Competition is
impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by
others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the
actions of regulatory authorities and other factors.  These
competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and
related products and services and the prices which we may charge for such
products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations
and our ability to grow our business.

Following
the expiration of our existing power sales agreements, we currently expect to
sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets
through contracts of various durations.  Competition in the wholesale
power markets will occur principally on the basis of the price of products and,
to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability.  We
expect the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in
the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity will continue
to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market in those
regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the prices we receive for
electricity.

We also
face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary
services.  We primarily compete with other electricity merchants based
on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different
sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and
transmission from electric utilities and ISOs.  We also compete
against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and
access to credit sources, and many of our competitors have greater financial
resources than we have.

Competitors
in the wholesale power markets in which PPL Generation subsidiaries and PPL
EnergyPlus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies,
non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated
utilities.  In the past, PUHCA significantly restricted mergers and
acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility
sector.  Entirely new competitors, including financial institutions,
may enter the energy markets as a result of the repeal of PUHCA.  The
repeal of PUHCA also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in
competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we
have.

If
the present trend towards competitive markets is reversed, discontinued or
delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Some
deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price
volatility.  In some of these markets, state legislators, government
agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to delay market
restructuring, change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of
these markets that have previously been deregulated or permit electricity
delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities.  In
certain states, elements and implications of the electricity market
restructurings are being investigated by legislators and regulators or are the
subject of ongoing litigation.  In 2001, the FERC instituted a series
of price controls designed to mitigate (or cap) prices in the entire western
U.S. to address the extreme volatility in the California electricity
markets.  These price controls have had the effect of significantly
lowering spot and forward electricity prices in the western
market.  In addition, the ISOs that oversee the transmission systems
in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized
to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the
power markets.  These types of price limitations and other mechanisms
may reduce the profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business
would have realized based on competitive market conditions absent such
limitations and mechanisms.  Although we generally expect electricity
markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our
industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric
power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or
reversed in the states in which we currently, or may in the future,
operate.

At this
time, there are various ongoing regulatory and legislative activities in
Pennsylvania regarding PLR supply after 2009.  We cannot predict the
final outcome of these regulatory and legislative activities or their ultimate
impact on PPL and PPL Energy Supply, along with PPL Electric.  For
additional information on PLR issues after 2009, see

"Conditions affecting PPL Electricâs
PLR supply after 2009 are currently uncertain"

under the "Risks Related
to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment" discussion.

We
are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and
marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets.

We
purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs
authorized by the FERC throughout the United States and also enter into
short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our
generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price
fluctuations.  If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and
electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay
damages.  These damages would generally be based on the difference
between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the
contract price of the undelivered capacity or electricity.  Depending
on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be
significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation
facility outages, transmissions disruptions, and other factors could affect our
ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market
price of replacement capacity and electricity.

In
addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post
collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy
varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds.  At
December 31, 2007, we posted $469 million of collateral, in the form of
letters of credit, under these contracts.  Although we currently
believe that we have sufficient liquidity facilities to fulfill our potential
collateral obligations under these contracts, we increased our available
liquidity facilities to $3.9 billion in 2007, in order to satisfy these
collateral obligations and to maintain our credit ratings.  The
increase was needed, in significant part, due to the potential collateral
requirements under these contracts, and to support contracts that we expect to
enter as we seek to expand our wholesale marketing and trading business,
including power contracts for the sale of electricity that will become available
following the expiration of our PLR contracts with PPL Electric.

We also
face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their
performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a
lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at
the time of contract.  Whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these
risks through various means, including through agreements that require our
counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy
varies from the contract prices beyond certain thresholds.  However,
there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty
nonperformance.  Counterparty nonperformance could adversely impact
our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn
subject us to claims for damages.

We
do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price
volatility.

We
attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity
sales arrangements by either reserving generation capacity to deliver
electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and
services through the competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales
contracts.  We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and
electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to weather
conditions, fuel requirements and other electricity-related
commodities.  However, based on economic and other considerations, we
may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price
volatility.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price
volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely
affected.

Our
risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices,
interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned,
and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs.

We
actively manage the market risk inherent in our energy-related, debt, foreign
currency and counterparty credit positions.  We have implemented
procedures to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management policy and
programs, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification of
risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting
of various risk measurement metrics.  Nonetheless, our risk management
programs may not work as planned.  For instance, actual electricity
and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the
historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management
positions.  Similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange
rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were
not set up to address.  As a result, we cannot always predict the
impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events lead
to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions were intended to
hedge.  If our risk management positions are ineffective in this way,
we could be subject to mark-to-market accounting with respect to certain of our
risk management contracts, which could lead to significant volatility in our
earnings and our financial position.

In
addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed to
the credit risk that counterparties that owe us money, electricity or fuel will
breach their obligations.  We have established a risk management
policy and programs, including credit risk programs, to evaluate counterparty
credit risk.  However, if counterparties to these arrangements fail to
perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current
market prices.  In that event, our financial results are likely to be
adversely affected.

Despite
federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject
to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or
prevent or delay operation of our facilities.

Our U.S.
generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale
market.  Generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC.  The FERC has
authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our
marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices.  The FERC retains the
authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose
"cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not workably
competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and
reasonable rates.  Any reduction by the FERC in the rates we may
receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could
materially adversely affect our results of operations.  See "FERC
Market-Based Rate Authority" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the FERC's
market-based rate authority program.

In
addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity
generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and
certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies.  We
may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory
approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory
approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to
comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and
our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to
additional costs.

We
are actively pursuing growth of generation capacity, which involves a number of
uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.

We are
actively pursuing expansion of our generation capacity over the next several
years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the
potential construction of new power plants and the potential acquisition of
existing plants.  The acquisition, development and construction of
additional generation capacity through any of these means involve numerous
risks.  Any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns,
reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs.  With
respect to the construction of new plants or the acquisition of existing plants,
we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering,
permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses in preparation for
competitive bids that we may not win or before it can be established whether a
project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being
financed.  The success of both a new project and a newly-acquired
plant would likely be contingent upon, among other things, the negotiation of
satisfactory fuel supply and power sales contracts, as well as acceptable
financing conditions.  Our success in developing a new plant or
expanding existing generation capacity would likely be contingent upon, among
other things, negotiation of satisfactory engineering and construction
contracts, receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals and
satisfactory completion of construction.  If we were unable to
complete the construction or expansion of a facility, we would generally not be
able to recover our investment in the project.  Furthermore, we may be
unable to run any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which
could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced
earnings.

For
example, as discussed in more detail in Note 9 to the Financial Statements, we
have announced our intention to file a COLA with the NRC by the end of 2008 to
construct a new nuclear unit.  We are making substantial expenditures
on this COLA process, but we have not yet committed to construction of this new
nuclear unit and such construction is subject to numerous
uncertainties.  In addition to the general uncertainties discussed
above for our generation expansion plans, these uncertainties include NRC and
other governmental approvals, potential public opposition, the continuing NRC
review of the Evolutionary Power Reactor technology involved, the cost and
availability of acceptable financing including under the DOE's loan guarantee
and other governmental programs, acceptable arrangements with project partners
and vendors, schedule delays, legislative and regulatory changes, competitive
market structure and the prospect for cost recovery, among other
factors.

Our
costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to
continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital
expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely
affect our profitability and liquidity.

Our
business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and
regulations relating to environmental protection.  To comply with
existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary
pollution control measures we may take, we expect to spend substantial amounts
in the future on environmental control and compliance.

As a
result of existing and recently-enacted federal environmental laws and
regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-burning plants, PPL's
current installation plan for the scrubbers and other pollution control
equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate, nitrogen oxides and
mercury emissions reduction) through 2012 reflects a total estimated cost of
approximately $1.6 billion, of which PPL has already spent $0.9
billion.  While installation of this pollution control equipment
remains on schedule, a delay in such installation could require us to purchase
additional pollution control emission allowances at market prices or decrease
the expected value of excess emission allowances that we could sell at market
prices as a result of the scheduled installation of this
equipment.  Such a delay also could require us to burn higher cost,
lower sulfur coal at these facilities.  Many states and environmental
groups have challenged certain of the federal laws and regulations relating to
air emissions as not being sufficiently strict.  As a result, it is
possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose
more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently in effect, which
could require us to incur significantly greater capital expenditures for
pollution control equipment.

We may
not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals
necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary to
our business.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required
environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply
with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or
subjected to additional costs.  Furthermore, at some of our older
facilities it may be uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment,
which may cause us to shut down those generation units.

There
also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global
warming).  Various legislative proposals are being considered in
Congress, and several states already have passed legislation capping carbon
dioxide emissions.

For more
information regarding environmental matters, including the existing and proposed
federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are
subject, see "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements.

We
are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our
Susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety
requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and
uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its
licensed life.

Nuclear
generation accounted for about 31% of our 2007 generation output.  The
risks of nuclear generation generally include:

Â·

the
      potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting
      from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and
      disposal of radioactive materials;

Â·

limitations
      on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover
      losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear
      operations; and

Â·

uncertainties
      with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning
      nuclear plants at the end of their licensed
  lives.

The NRC
has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as well
as security-related and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
generation facilities.  In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the
authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is
achieved.  In addition, revised security or safety requirements
promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital or operating
expenditures at our Susquehanna nuclear plant.  In addition, although
we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our Susquehanna
plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and
injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.

Risks
Related to International Delivery Segment

(

PPL and PPL Energy
Supply

)

Our
U.K. delivery business is also subject to risks with respect to rate regulation
and operational performance.

Our U.K.
delivery business is rate-regulated.  In addition, its ability to
manage operational risk is critical to its financial
performance.  Accordingly, this business is subject to the same
general risks as those described below under "Risks Related to Pennsylvania
Delivery Segment."

Our
U.K. delivery business exposes us to risks related to laws of other countries,
taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
political and regulatory conditions and policies of foreign
governments.  These risks may reduce our results of operations from
our delivery business.

The
acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the U.K. entail
significant financial risks, including:

Risks
Related to Pennsylvania Delivery Segment

(

PPL and PPL
Electric

)

Regulators
may not approve the rates we request.

Our
Pennsylvania delivery business is rate-regulated.  While such
regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs,
including energy supply costs for customers, and a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are
subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory
authorities.  There is no guarantee that the rates authorized by
regulators will match our actual costs or provide a particular return on
invested capital at any given time.

Our
transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which may
increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect
on our financial performance.

Our
ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and
distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery
business.  Our delivery business also faces several risks, including
the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due
to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes and other
factors.  Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may
result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance
costs.

We
are subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of PJM's
regional transmission expansion plan (RTEP) process.

PJM and
the FERC have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional
transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission
owners.  As discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements, we will
be making substantial expenditures to construct a major new transmission line
that PJM has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional
transmission grid.  Although we have applied to the FERC for incentive
rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot predict the ultimate cost and
regulatory treatment.  We also cannot predict the in-service schedule
for these facilities or whether delays may occur due to public opposition and
other factors.  Delays could result in significant cost increases for
these facilities and decreased reliability of the regional transmission
grid.  As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or
operational impact of this project or other RTEP projects on PPL
Electric.

We
could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory
reliability standards.

Under the
Energy Policy Act, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system
are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and
enforced by the FERC.  Compliance with new reliability standards may
subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and
violations of these standards could result in substantial
penalties.  As discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, as a
result of its self-reporting to the RFC of a potential violation of certain
reliability standards, PPL Electric could be subject to substantial penalties
for such violation.

PPL
Electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able to
obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge to
its PLR customers.

In order
to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply
through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates we may charge to our PLR
customers, we have entered into PUC-approved, full requirements energy supply
agreements with PPL EnergyPlus at these capped rates.  Under one of
the PLR contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits with
PPL EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract
price by more than our contract collateral threshold.  Conversely, PPL
EnergyPlus is required to make performance assurance deposits with us when the
market price of electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its
contract collateral threshold.  Over the past few years, market prices
for electricity have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at
December 31, 2007, the market price of electricity exceeded the contract price
in total by approximately $2.5 billion.  Accordingly, at
December 31, 2007, PPL EnergyPlus was required to provide us with
performance assurance of $300 million, the maximum amount of collateral required
under the contract.  If PPL EnergyPlus is unable to satisfy its energy
supply obligations to us under the PLR contracts, we would be required to obtain
energy supply in the wholesale market at then-current market rates to meet our
PLR obligation.  While the Customer Choice Act provides generally for
PLR costs to be borne by customers, it is not clear whether we would be able to
pass on to our customers any costs of this replacement energy supply that exceed
the predetermined capped rates.

Conditions
affecting PPL Electric's PLR supply after 2009 are currently
uncertain.

Uncertainty
driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009 when its full requirements contracts with PPL EnergyPlus
expire presents a risk for the electricity delivery business.  The
Customer Choice Act requires electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric,
to act as a PLR of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will
be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the
PUC.  There are a number of ongoing regulatory and legislative
activities that may affect PPL Electric's recovery of supply costs after
2009.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure
default electricity supply in 2007-2009 for retail customers who do not choose
an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant to this plan,
PPL Electric has contracted for one-third of the 2010 electricity supply it
expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial
customers.  In November 2007, PPL Electric filed a plan with the PUC,
which is still pending, under which its residential and small commercial
customers, beginning in mid-2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the
impact of price increases when generation rate caps expire in
2010.  In September 2007, the PUC regulations regarding the obligation
of Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond became effective.  Later this year, PPL Electric plans to
file for PUC approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan under these
regulations.  In addition to this regulatory activity, the Governor of
Pennsylvania has proposed an Energy Independence Strategy which, among other
things, contains initiatives to address PLR issues including a requirement that
PLRs will obtain a "least-cost portfolio" of electric supply.  The
Pennsylvania legislature has convened and continues a special session to address
the proposals in the Governor's Strategy and other energy issues.  In
addition, certain Pennsylvania legislators have introduced legislation to extend
generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in PPL
Electric's case is December 31, 2009.  PPL and PPL Electric have
expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential consequences of such
legislation on customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation
supply and PPL Electric's financial viability.  If such legislation or
similar legislation is enacted, PPL Electric could be faced with severe
financial impacts including operating losses and significant cash flow
shortfalls.  In addition, continuing uncertainty regarding PPL
Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its
business after 2009 could adversely impact its credit quality, financing costs
and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its
business.

Whether
we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into power purchase contracts in
order to mitigate market price and delivery risk, and our ability to recover
costs associated with such contracts, may affect our earnings.

In order
to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply
after 2009, when the full requirements energy supply agreements with PPL
EnergyPlus expire, we have entered into power purchase agreements that include
fixed prices.  Whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter
into such agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect our
financial performance.  For instance, in the absence of power purchase
agreements, we would purchase the energy, capacity and other products in the
competitive wholesale power markets at then-current market
prices.  The current forward prices for electricity exceed the prices
available under some of our current power sales agreements, and our financial
performance will be affected by our ability to enter into new supply contracts,
the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to prevailing market
conditions, and the regulatory treatment for such contracts and the associated
recovery of our supply costs.  Depending on these factors, our
financial results may be materially adversely affected.

Other
Risks Related to All Segments

(

PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric

)

Our
operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of
severe weather conditions.

Our
businesses are seasonal.  For example, in some markets demand for, and
market prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other
markets such peaks occur in the cold winter months.  As a result, our
overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a
seasonal basis, especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves,
extreme cold weather or storms make such fluctuations more
pronounced.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on
the nature and location of the facilities we acquire or develop and the terms of
our contracts to sell electricity.

We
cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently
being conducted with respect to our current and past business
activities.  An adverse determination could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

We are
involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing
state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the
most significant of which are summarized in "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues"
and in "Environmental Matters - Domestic" in Note 15 to the Financial
Statements.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters,
nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially
result from a negative outcome in each case.

We
may need significant additional financing to pursue growth
opportunities.

We
continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may enter
into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the
future.  An acquisition agreement or development commitment may
require access to substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable
terms.  We also may need external financing to fund capital
expenditures, including capital expenditures necessary to comply with
environmental regulations or other regulatory requirements.  Our
ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are dependent on numerous
factors, including general economic conditions, credit availability and our
financial performance.  The inability to obtain sufficient financing
on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to pursue
acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital
expenditures.

A
downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access
capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new
debt.

Our
current credit ratings by Moody's, Fitch and S&P are listed in "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital
Resources."  While we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability
to fund our short-term liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any
ratings downgrades could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively
affect our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new
long-term debt.

Significant
increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including our health care
and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and
liquidity.

We
continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and
maintenance expenses.  However, we expect to continue to face
increased cost pressures in our operations, including with respect to materials
and labor costs as a result of general inflation, increased nationwide plant
construction and other factors.  In addition, pursuant to our
collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide
specified levels of health care and pension benefits to current employees and
retirees covered by the contracts.  We provide a similar level of
benefits to our management employees.  These benefits give rise to
significant expenses.  Due to general inflation with respect to such
costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have
experienced significant health care cost inflation in the last few years, and we
expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue
to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to continue to take
to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their
health care benefits.  In addition, we expect to continue to
experience significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans
that we sponsor for our employees and retirees.  The measurement of
our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities
is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors
beyond our control.  These assumptions include investment returns,
interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases
and the demographics of plan participants.  If our assumptions prove
to be inaccurate, our costs could be significantly increased.

There
is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for
certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our
earnings.

Under
GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets
may be impaired.  While no goodwill impairments were required based on
our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2007, we are unable to predict
whether any impairment charges may be necessary in the future.

We also
review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.

During
2007, PPL impaired certain transmission rights, certain domestic
telecommunications assets, certain assets of the natural gas distribution and
propane businesses, and the net assets of our Bolivian businesses prior to their
sale in July.

During 2006, PPL recorded a loss on the sale of
our interest in the Griffith plant and fully impaired our synfuel-related
assets.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the Financial
Statements.  In addition, we are in the process of selling our natural
gas distribution and propane businesses, which may result in a loss on
sale.  We are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other
losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in the
future.

PPL CORPORATION

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL is an
energy and utility holding company with headquarters in Allentown,
PA.  Please refer to Exhibit 99(a) in Item 15 for a listing of the
current corporate organization and to "Item 1. Business - Background," for
descriptions of PPL's reportable segments, which are Supply, International
Delivery and Pennsylvania Delivery.  Through its subsidiaries, PPL is
primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key
markets - the northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity
in Pennsylvania and the U.K.  In 2007, PPL sold its regulated
electricity delivery businesses in Latin America, which were included in the
International Delivery segment.  In July 2007, PPL announced its
intention to sell its natural gas distribution and propane businesses, which are
included in the Pennsylvania Delivery segment.  See Note 10 to the
Financial Statements for information on the sales and planned
divestitures.  PPL's overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth
in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and
earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in regulated electricity
delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer and
regulatory relations.  More specifically, PPL's strategy for its
electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with
load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy
counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy
and fuel price volatility and counterparty credit risk.  PPL's
strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these
businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer
service and reliability.

PPL faces
several risks in its generation business.  The principal risks are
electricity and capacity wholesale price risk, fuel supply and price risk, power
plant performance, evolving regulatory frameworks and counterparty credit
risk.  PPL attempts to manage these risks through various
means.  For instance, PPL operates a portfolio of generation assets
that is diversified as to geography, fuel source, cost structure and operating
characteristics.  PPL currently expects to expand its generation
capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of its
existing power plants, the potential construction of new plants and the
potential acquisition of existing plants or businesses.  PPL is and
will continue to remain focused on the operating efficiency and availability of
its existing and any newly constructed or acquired power plants.  In
addition, PPL has executed and continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths
for energy sales and fuel supply, and other means to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse changes in the difference, or margin, between the cost
to produce electricity and the price at which PPL sells it.  PPL's
future profitability will be affected by whether PPL decides to, or is able to,
continue to enter into long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel
purchase agreements or renew its existing agreements and prevailing market
conditions.  Currently, PPL's commitments for energy sales are
satisfied through its own generation assets and supply purchased from third
parties.  PPL markets and trades around its physical portfolio of
generating assets through integrated generation, marketing and trading
functions.

PPL has
in place risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to
monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to
changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its
generating units.

The
principal challenge that PPL faces in its electricity delivery businesses is to
maintain high quality customer service and reliability in a cost-effective
manner.  PPL's electricity delivery businesses are
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, these businesses are subject to
regulatory risk with respect to costs that may be recovered and investment
returns that may be collected through customer rates.  In particular,
uncertainty driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL
Electric's PLR obligation after 2009, when its full requirements supply
contracts with PPL EnergyPlus expire, presents a risk for the domestic
electricity delivery business.  The Customer Choice Act requires
electricity delivery companies, like PPL Electric, to act as a PLR of
electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such
companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the PUC.  As
discussed in more detail in "Results of Operations - Segment Results -
Pennsylvania Delivery Segment - 2008 Outlook," there are a number of ongoing
regulatory and legislative activities that may affect PPL Electric's recovery of
supply costs after 2009.  In May 2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's
plan to procure default electricity supply in 2007-2009 for retail customers who
do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010.  Pursuant
to this plan, PPL Electric has contracted for one-third of the 2010 electricity
supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial
customers.  In November 2007, PPL Electric filed a plan with the PUC,
which is still pending, under which its residential and small commercial
customers, beginning in mid-2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the
impact of price increases when generation rate caps expire in
2010.  In September 2007, the PUC regulations regarding the obligation
of Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond became effective.  Later this year, PPL Electric plans to
file for PUC approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan under these
regulations.  In addition to this regulatory activity, the Governor of
Pennsylvania has proposed an Energy Independence Strategy which, among other
things, contains initiatives to address PLR issues including a requirement that
PLRs will obtain a "least-cost portfolio" of electric supply.  The
Pennsylvania legislature has convened and continues a special session to address
the proposals in the Governor's Strategy and other energy issues.  In
addition, certain Pennsylvania legislators have introduced legislation to extend
generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for
Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in PPL
Electric's case is December 31, 2009.  PPL and PPL Electric have
expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential consequences of such
legislation on customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation
supply and PPL Electric's financial viability.

PPL faces
additional financial risks in conducting international operations, such as
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  PPL attempts to
manage these financial risks through its risk management programs.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for
PPL's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL
continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and
liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning the material risks that PPL
faces in its businesses.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL's past and
expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the
risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

The
information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL's
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

Supply
Segment

The
Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
Supply.  In August 2007, PPL completed the sale of its domestic
telecommunication operations.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.

The
Supply segment results in 2006 and 2005 reflect the reclassification of PPL's
interest in the Griffith plant's operating revenues and expenses from certain
income statement line items to Discontinued Operations.  The Supply
segment results in 2005 also reflect the reclassification of the Sundance
plant's revenues and expenses to Discontinued Operations.  See Note 10
to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The
      mark-to-market impact on transactions, which do not qualify for hedge
      accounting under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
      Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted, and are probable of going
      to physical delivery, is economically neutral to PPL.  These
      transactions are intended to economically hedge a specific risk and do not
      represent speculative trading activity.  See "Changes in
      Domestic Gross Energy Margins by Region" and Note 18 to the Financial
      Statements for additional information regarding economic
      activity.

(b)

In
      the first quarter of 2005, PPL recognized a charge for a loss contingency
      related to litigation with NorthWestern.  In September 2005, PPL
      and NorthWestern reached a final agreement to settle this
      litigation.

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL projects lower 2008 earnings for its Supply segment compared
with 2007 as a result of the loss of synfuel-related earnings and higher
depreciation for scrubbers being installed at both coal-fired generation units
at the Montour power plant and at Unit 3 of the Brunner Island power plant,
which are expected to be placed in service in 2008.  PPL expects these
negative effects to be partially offset by higher energy margins as a result of
higher-valued wholesale energy contracts and higher expected baseload generation
compared with 2007.

International Delivery
Segment

The
International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
electricity.  PPL Global's major remaining international business is
located in the U.K.  In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Latin
American businesses.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

The
International Delivery segment results in 2007, 2006 and 2005 reflect the
reclassification of Latin American revenues and expenses to Discontinued
Operations.

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL projects the earnings of its International Delivery segment
will decline in 2008 compared with 2007, due to the 2007 sale of PPL's Latin
American businesses and higher U.S. income taxes, primarily driven by the U.S.
income tax benefits realized in 2007.  Partially offsetting the impact
of these negative earnings drivers is lower pension expense at WPD.

Pennsylvania Delivery
Segment

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric and gas delivery
operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.  In July 2007, PPL
announced its intention to sell its natural gas distribution and propane
businesses.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment results in 2007, 2006 and 2005 reflect the

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL projects higher earnings for its Pennsylvania Delivery
segment, driven by higher revenues as a result of PPL Electric's new
distribution rates effective January 1, 2008.

In March
2007, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase distribution rates
by approximately $84 million (subsequently amended to $77
million).  In August 2007, PPL Electric entered into a settlement
agreement with the parties to increase its distribution rates by $55 million,
effective January 1, 2008, for an overall revenue increase of 1.7% over PPL
Electric's 2007 rates.  In December 2007, the PUC approved this
settlement without modification.

In May
2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure default electricity supply
in 2007-2009 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive
supplier in 2010 after PPL Electric's PLR contract with PPL EnergyPlus
expires.  Under the plan, PPL Electric was approved to issue a series
of competitive bids for such supply in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In July
2007, the PUC approved bids for the first of six competitive solicitations and
PPL Electric entered into supply contracts for 850 MW, or one-sixth of its
expected electricity supply needs in 2010 for residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers who do not choose a competitive
supplier.  The average generation supply prices from the first bid
process were $101.77 per MWh for residential customers and $105.11 per MWh for
small commercial and small industrial customers.  In October 2007, the
PUC approved bids for the second competitive solicitation and PPL Electric
entered into contracts for another 850 MW of 2010 generation supply for these
customers.  The average generation supply prices from the second bid
process were $105.08 per MWh for residential customers and $105.75 per MWh for
small commercial and small industrial customers.  As a result, PPL
Electric has contracted for one-third of the electricity supply it expects to
need for 2010.  If the average prices paid for the supply purchased so
far were to be the same for the remaining four purchases, the average
residential customer's monthly bill in 2010 would increase about 34.5% over 2009
levels, while small commercial and small industrial bills would increase in the
range of 22.8% to 42.2%.  The estimated increases include Pennsylvania
gross receipts tax and an adjustment for line losses, and exclude PPL Electric's
January 1, 2008 rate increase.  Actual 2010 prices will not be known
until all six supply purchases have been made.  The third solicitation
will be conducted in March 2008.

In May
2007, the PUC approved final regulations regarding the obligation of
Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond.  The new regulations provide that default service
providers will acquire electricity supply at prevailing market prices pursuant
to procurement and implementation plans approved by the PUC.  The
regulations also address the utilities' recovery of market supply
costs.  The final regulations became effective in September
2007.

In
addition, the Governor of Pennsylvania proposed an Energy Independence Strategy
(Strategy) in early 2007 which, among other things, contains initiatives to
address PLR issues.  For example, under the Strategy, retail customers
could elect to phase-in over three years any initial generation rate increase
approved by the PUC.  Also, PLR providers would be required to obtain
a "least cost portfolio" of supply by purchasing power in the spot market and
through contracts of varying lengths, and the provider would be required to
procure energy conservation resources before acquiring additional
power.  In addition, PLR providers could enter into long-term
contracts with large energy users and alternative energy
developers.  It is uncertain at this time whether the details of
implementing the Strategy, including the issues of deferral of costs and
recovery of interest for the customer rate phase-in program and the timing of
PUC approval for PLR supply portfolios, will be delegated to the
PUC.

Components
of the Strategy are included in various bills.  One such bill that
passed in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (House) in February 2008,
contains conservation and demand-side management targets and mandatory
deployment of smart metering technology.  The bill provides for full
and current cost recovery through an energy efficiency and demand-side
management recovery mechanism.

In
September 2007, the Pennsylvania General Assembly convened a special session to
address the proposals in the Governor's Strategy.  Central to the
Governor's Strategy is an $850 million Energy Independence Fund to support
alternative and renewable energy sources and energy conservation that would be
funded through revenue bonds and a surcharge on electricity
bills.  The Pennsylvania Senate (Senate) has formed a special
committee to manage legislation for the special legislative
session.  As an alternative to the Governor's $850 million Energy
Independence Fund, the full Senate has approved a bill that would create a $650
million fund for clean energy projects, conservation and energy efficiency
initiatives and pollution control projects that would be funded through revenue
bonds and gross receipts tax revenue, which will increase as rate caps
expire.  The House is also considering similar legislation to create
an $850 million dollar fund, also to be funded through revenue bonds and gross
receipts tax revenue.

PPL and
PPL Electric currently are working with Pennsylvania legislators, regulators and
other stakeholders to develop constructive measures to help customers transition
to market rates after 2009, including a variety of rate mitigation, educational
and energy conservation programs, consistent with several initiatives being
developed by the state administration and legislature.  In this
regard, in November 2007, PPL Electric requested the PUC to approve a plan under
which its residential and small commercial customers could smooth the impact of
price increases when generation rate caps expire in 2010.  The
proposed phase-in plan would provide customers the option of paying
additional amounts on their electric bills beginning in mid-2008 and
continuing through 2009.  Funds collected during 2008 and 2009,
plus accrued interest, would be applied to 2010 and 2011 electric bills,
mitigating the impact of the rate cap expiration.  PPL Electric
requested expedited consideration by the PUC.  Ten parties have filed
responses to PPL Electric's petition, primarily because PPL Electric's proposal
would offer the program on an "opt-out" basis (i.e., customers would be enrolled
automatically and affirmatively have to "opt-out" if they choose not to
participate).

The
parties have reached a settlement of this proceeding under which PPL Electric
has agreed to change the "opt-out" approach to an "opt-in" approach (i.e.,
customers would have to affirmatively enroll).  In addition, PPL
Electric has agreed to make the program available to customers enrolled in
budget billing.  On February 27, 2008, the settlement agreement was
filed with the Administrative Law Judge assigned to this case.  The
settlement must be approved by the Administrative Law Judge and the
PUC.

Certain
Pennsylvania legislators have introduced or are contemplating the introduction
of legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery
through rates for Pennsylvania utilities beyond their transition periods, which
in PPL Electric's case would be December 31, 2009.  PPL and PPL
Electric have expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential
consequences of such legislation on customer service, system reliability,
adequate future generation supply and PPL Electric's financial
viability.  If such legislation or similar legislation is enacted, PPL
Electric could experience operating losses, cash flow shortfalls and other
adverse financial impacts.  In addition, continuing uncertainty
regarding PPL Electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of
operation after 2009 could adversely impact its credit quality, financing costs
and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its
business.  In addition, PPL and PPL Electric believe that such an
extension of rate caps, if enacted into law, would violate federal law and the
U.S. Constitution.  At this time, PPL and PPL Electric cannot predict
the final outcome or impact of this legislative and regulatory
process.

(a)

Adjusted
      to exclude the impact of any revenues and costs not associated with
      domestic gross energy margins, consistent with the way management reviews
      domestic gross energy margins internally.  These exclusions
      include revenues and energy costs related to the international operations
      of PPL Global, the domestic delivery operations of PPL Electric, revenues
      prior to 2007 associated with the settlement of Wallingford cost-based
      rates (see Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information)
      and an accrual for the loss contingency related to the PJM billing dispute
      in 2005 and 2006 (see Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
      information).  Also adjusted to include the margins of the
      Griffith and Sundance plants prior to their sales in June 2006 and May

      and maintenance" expenses on the Statements of
  Income.

Changes in Domestic Gross
Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
gross energy margins are generated through PPL's non-trading and trading
activities.  PPL manages its non-trading energy business on a
geographic basis that is aligned with its generation
assets.  Additionally, beginning in 2006, PPL further segregates
non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and
economic activity.  Economic activity represents the net unrealized
effect of derivative transactions that are entered into as economic hedges, and
that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting was not
elected, under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended and interpreted.

Eastern
U.S.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $119 million higher in 2007 compared with 2006. This
increase was primarily due to new full requirements supply contracts and higher
wholesale market prices for electricity.  Also contributing to the
improvement was increased generation output from PPL's nuclear and coal
generating facilities.  Nuclear generation was 2% higher in
2007.  Coal generation was up slightly in 2007 despite the retirement
of Martins Creek Units 1 and 2 in September.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $61 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This change relates to gains in electricity positions,
including a $19 million increase in the fair value of capacity contracts in PJM
related to PJM's implementation of its Reliability Pricing Model
(RPM).  Prior to the RPM, PPL recorded valuation reserves for capacity
contracts due to the lack of liquidity and reliable, observable prices in the
marketplace.  With the implementation of the RPM and the completion of
PJM capacity auctions, forward capacity prices became sufficiently observable
and PPL no longer reserves for capacity contracts in PJM.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $166 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
due to higher PLR sales prices and higher wholesale prices.  PLR sales
prices were 8.4% higher in 2006, in accordance with the schedule established by
the PUC Final Order.  Partially offsetting these higher margins was
lower nuclear generation of 3%, as well as higher coal and nuclear fuel prices,
which were up 12% and 10%.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $5 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005.

Western
U.S.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $30 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to higher market prices for
electricity combined with increased generation from the coal-fired generating
facilities.  Coal generation was 6% higher in 2007.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $3 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $10 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
due to higher wholesale prices.  Also contributing to the increase was
a 6% increase in hydroelectric generation.  Partially offsetting these
improvements were higher coal prices, which were up 14%, and the sale of PPL's
50% interest in the Griffith plant in June 2006 and the sale of PPL's Sundance
plant in May 2005.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on these sales.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $2 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005.

Net
Energy Trading

PPL
enters into energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL may at times create a net open
position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do
not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The margins from
these trading activities are reflected in the Statements of Income as "Net
energy trading margins."  These physical and financial contracts cover
trading activity associated with electricity, gas and oil.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $6 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  Energy trading margins from realized transactions decreased $10
million and were partially offset by an increase in unrealized transactions of
$4 million.

Net
energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2006 compared with
2005.  Energy trading margins from unrealized transactions increased
$14 million and were partially offset by a decrease in realized transactions of
$1 million.  This change in unrealized transactions was primarily due
to contracts reclassified as trading activity from hedge (non-trading)
transactions related to the Griffith plant after the announced plan to sell
PPL's interest in the plant.

The
increases in utility revenues for 2007 compared with 2006, excluding foreign
currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to:

Â·

higher
      PLR revenues and electric delivery revenues, primarily due to a 4%
      increase in sales volume.  This increase was primarily due to
      the impact of favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial
      sales and to normal load growth; and

Â·

higher
      U.K. utility revenues, primarily due to an increase in prices effective
      April 1, 2007, favorable changes in customer mix and an increase in
      engineering services performed for third parties.  The increase
      was partially offset by a 3% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to
      milder weather in 2007.

The
increases in utility revenues for 2006 compared with 2005, excluding foreign
currency exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to:

Â·

higher
      PLR revenues resulting from an 8.4% rate increase, offset by a decrease in
      domestic electric delivery revenues, resulting from a decrease in sales
      volume due in part to milder weather in 2006; and

Â·

higher
      U.K. utility revenues, primarily due to higher average prices and
      favorable changes in customer mix.

Energy-related
Businesses

Energy-related
businesses contributed $27 million more to operating income in 2007 compared
with 2006.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Â·

$61
      million of higher pre-tax contributions from synfuel
      projects.  This reflects a $66 million net gain on the
      settlement of options purchased to hedge the risk associated with the
      phase-out of the synthetic fuel tax credits and an impairment charge of
      $10 million on the synfuel-related assets in 2006, partially offset by $15
      million of higher operating losses due to higher production levels in
      2007; and

Â·

a
      $9 million increase related to PPL's mechanical contracting and
      engineering subsidiaries; partially offset by

Â·

a
      $39 million impairment of domestic telecommunication assets that were sold
      in August 2007 (see Note 9 to the Financial
  Statements).

Energy-related
businesses contributed $29 million more to operating income in 2006 compared
with 2005.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Â·

$18
      million of lower pre-tax losses from synfuel projects.  This
      reflects $29 million of lower operating losses due to lower production
      levels, partially offset by an impairment charge of $10 million recorded
      in 2006 on the synfuel-related assets; and

Â·

an
      $8 million increase from its domestic telecommunications subsidiary, due
      to an increase in transport-related sales, as well as reduced spending on
      a product line (before depreciation, interest expense and income
      taxes).

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the shutdown of the
synfuel facilities in 2007.

Discontinued
Operations

In the
third quarter of 2007, PPL recognized a $23 million deferred tax charge in
connection with the anticipated sale of PPL's natural gas distribution and
propane businesses.

In the
fourth quarter of 2007, PPL recorded a $21 million impairment, net of a $1
million tax benefit.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
additional information on the operating results recorded in 2007, 2006 and
2005.

In the
second quarter of 2007, PPL recorded an $89 million gain, net of a $5 million
tax expense, in connection with the sale of its El Salvadoran regulated
electricity delivery business.  In the third quarter of 2007, PPL also
sold its Bolivian businesses.  In connection with this sale, PPL
recorded a $20 million impairment, net of a $17 million tax
benefit.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, PPL recorded a $197 million
gain, net of a $109 million tax expense, in connection with the sale of its
Chilean business.

In 2006,
PPL recorded a $23 million loss, net of a $16 million tax benefit, in connection
with the sale of its ownership interest in the Griffith plant.  Also
included in Discontinued Operations is the acceleration of $7 million, after
tax, of net unrealized gains on derivatives associated with the Griffith
plant.

In 2005,
PPL recorded a $47 million loss, net of a $26 million tax benefit, in connection
with the sale of its Sundance plant.

See Note
10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the above sales,
and information regarding operating results recorded prior to the
sales.

Cumulative
Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

In 2005,
PPL adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143."  FIN 47 clarifies that an
entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional
ARO when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably
estimated.  FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an
ARO.  Application of the interpretation resulted in a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle that decreased net income by $8
million in 2005.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

PPL is
focused on maintaining its investment grade credit profile by maintaining an
appropriate liquidity position and a strong balance sheet.  PPL
believes that its cash on hand, short-term investments, operating cash flows,
access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken as a
whole, provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements,
future security maturities and estimated future capital
expenditures.  PPL currently expects cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments at the end of 2008 to be approximately $500 million and
expects to increase its credit facility capacity up to approximately $5.0
billion in 2008.  However, PPL's cash flows from operations and access
to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and
uncertainties including, but not limited to:

At
December 31, PPL had the following:

At
December 31, 2007, PPL had $15 million of auction rate securities in its
portfolio of short-term investments.  Recent investor concerns over
insurers who guarantee the credit of certain of the underlying securities and
other conditions have resulted in some investors of auction rate securities
being unable to sell such securities at auction.  This has resulted in
investors continuing to own these securities, generally at higher interest
rates, until the subsequent auction.  As of December 31, 2007, PPL did
not have material exposure to loss given the high quality of the underlying
securities and the amount of auction rate securities held.

The
changes in PPL's cash and cash equivalents position resulted from:

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased by 11%, or $187 million, in 2007
compared with 2006, primarily as a result of increased expenditures for fuel and
increased U.S. income tax payments, a portion of which related to taxes incurred
in connection with the sale of PPL's Latin American businesses, partially offset
by higher revenues in 2007 compared with 2006.  The higher revenues
resulted primarily from higher wholesale market prices for electricity in the
U.S. and increased domestic sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of
favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial sales and normal load
growth.

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased by 27%, or $370 million, in 2006
compared with 2005, primarily as a result of higher domestic retail electric
revenues resulting from an 8.4% increase in PLR sales prices and increased
international delivery revenues, predominantly related to price increases and
changes in customer mix.  The increase from 2005 to 2006 was also due,
to a lesser extent, to reduced expenditures for oil in 2006 as a result of
building up inventory in 2005.  These increases were partially offset
by a decrease in domestic delivery revenues resulting from a decrease in sales
volumes, due in part to milder weather in 2006, increased expenditures for coal
and increased U.S. income tax payments, primarily due to lower utilization of
foreign tax credits in 2006.

PPL
expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating activities as
a result of its power sales commitments from wholesale and retail customers and
long-term fuel purchase contracts.  PPL estimates that, on average,
approximately 91% of its expected annual generation output for the period 2008
through 2009 is committed under power sales contracts.  PPL has and
will continue to layer in power sales contracts in the wholesale markets for the
capacity and energy currently committed under the PLR supply contracts with PPL
Electric, which expire at the end of 2009.  Based on the way in which
the wholesale markets have developed over the last several years, PPL expects
that new contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter duration than the
PLR supply contracts, which at inception had terms of approximately nine
years.

PPL's
contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash
collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or terminations of a
portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a
downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in
market prices.  For example, in addition to limiting its trading
ability, if PPL's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment
grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL estimates that, based on its
December 31, 2007 positions, it would have had to post additional collateral of
approximately $829 million, compared with $387 million at December 31,
2006.  PPL has in place risk management programs that are designed to
monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes
in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of its generating
units.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2007 and projected expenditures for the years 2008
through 2012.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 62%, or $1.0 billion, in 2007 compared
with 2006 primarily as a result of aggregate proceeds of $898 million received
from the sale of PPL's Latin American businesses and telecommunication
operations in 2007 compared to $110 million received from the sale of its
interest in the Griffith plant in 2006, as well as a change of $555 million from
purchases and sales of short-term investments and a change of $104 million from
purchases and sales of emission allowances.  These increases were
partially offset by an increase of $291 million in capital expenditures,
primarily as a result of the construction of pollution control equipment at
coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, and an increase of $113 million in the
additional amount of cash that became restricted.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 108%, or $838 million, in 2006 compared
with 2005.  There were a few items that contributed to this
increase.  Capital expenditures increased $583 million, primarily as a
result of the construction of pollution control equipment at coal-fired plants
in Pennsylvania, as discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, and $107
million related to the purchase of leased equipment.  See Note 11
to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2006 purchase of
leased equipment in connection with the termination of the related master lease
agreements.  Additionally, there was a change of $298 million from
purchases and sales of short-term investments, and PPL received $80 million less
in proceeds from the sale of power plants in 2006 compared with
2005.  The impact of the above items was partially offset by a change
of $75 million from purchases and sales of emission allowances and a decrease of
$22 million in the additional amount of cash that became
restricted.

Financing
Activities

Net cash
used in financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2007, compared with net cash
provided by financing activities of $95 million in 2006 and net cash used in
financing activities of $676 million in 2005.  The change from 2006 to
2007 primarily reflects reduced issuances of long-term debt and equity
securities in 2007, as well as repurchases of common stock under a $750 million
stock repurchase program approved by PPL's Board of Directors in June
2007.  The change from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflects increased
issuances of long-term debt, as well as the issuance of preference stock in
2006.

In 2007,
cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of
$170 million, the repurchase of 14,929,892 shares of common stock for $712
million and common and preferred dividends paid of $477 million, partially
offset by $32 million of common stock sale proceeds.  See Note 8 to
the Financial Statements for a discussion of the common stock repurchase
program.

In 2006,
cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances
of $277 million, net proceeds of $245 million from the issuance of preference
stock and $21 million of common stock sale proceeds, partially offset by common
and preferred dividends paid of $419 million.  See Note 7 to the
Financial Statements for information regarding the preference stock issued by
PPL Electric.

In 2005,
cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of
$340 million and common and preferred dividends paid of $349 million, partially
offset by common stock sale proceeds of $37 million.

See
"Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL's plans to issue debt and

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in the near
term, including various credit facilities, commercial paper programs, an
asset-backed commercial paper program, operating leases and, in the second half
of 2008, the anticipated sale of its natural gas distribution and propane
businesses.  PPL also expects to continue to have access to debt and
equity capital markets, as necessary, for its long-term financing
needs.

Credit

December 31, 2007, PPL's total committed borrowing capacity under credit
facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

In
addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
agreements contain various other covenants.  Failure to comply with
the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of
repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  PPL
monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular basis.  At
December 31, 2007, PPL was in material compliance with these
covenants.  At this time, PPL believes that these covenants and other
borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding
sources.

During
2008, PPL intends to maintain its existing credit facility capacity, which may
require the renewal and extension of certain facilities.  In addition,
PPL expects to increase its credit facility capacity by up to $500 million in
2008.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion
of PPL's credit facilities.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric maintain commercial paper programs for up to $500
million for PPL Energy Supply and for up to $200 million for PPL Electric to
provide an additional financing source to fund their short-term liquidity needs,
if and when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by
certain credit agreements of each company.  Neither PPL Energy Supply
nor PPL Electric had commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  During 2008, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric may issue
commercial paper from time to time to facilitate short-term cash flow
needs.  Additionally, PPL Energy Supply expects to increase the size
of its commercial paper program to $1.0 billion in 2008.

Asset-Backed
Commercial Paper Program

PPL
Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
it obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
receivable and unbilled revenues to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary
on an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure
loans of up to an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit
sponsored by a financial institution.  PPL Electric uses the proceeds
from the program for general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize
letters of credit.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, loan balances
outstanding were $41 million and $42 million, all of which were being used to
cash collateralize letters of credit.   See Note 8 to the
Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial paper
program.

Operating
Leases

PPL and
its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are provided through
operating leases.  PPL's subsidiaries lease office space, land,
buildings and certain equipment.  These leasing structures provide PPL
with additional operating and financing flexibility.  The operating
leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements, such as
maintaining insurance, maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of
rent and other fees.

PPL,
through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1
and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year, non-cancelable operating
leases.  These operating leases are not recorded on PPL's Balance
Sheets.  The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana's
ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare
dividends.  At this time, PPL believes that these restrictions will
not limit access to these funding sources or cause acceleration or termination
of the leases.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of other dividend restrictions related to PPL
subsidiaries.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
leases.

Anticipated
Sale of Gas and Propane Businesses

In 2007,
PPL announced its intention to sell its natural gas distribution and propane
businesses.  PPL expects the sale to be completed during the second
half of 2008.  Proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to
invest in growth opportunities in PPL's core electricity supply and delivery
businesses and/or for the repurchase of securities, including PPL common
stock.

Long-Term
Debt and Equity Securities

Subject
to market conditions in 2008, PPL and its subsidiaries currently plan to issue
up to $600 million in long-term debt securities.  PPL expects to use
the proceeds primarily to fund capital expenditures, to fund redemptions of
existing debt and for general corporate purposes.  PPL currently does
not plan to issue significant amounts of common stock in 2008.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL currently expects to incur future
cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment
of dividends on its common and preferred securities and possibly the repurchase
of a portion of its common stock, beginning in 2009.

PPL's
capital expenditure projections for the years 2008-2012 total approximately $7.5
billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to
reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  This table includes projected costs related to the
planned 331 MW incremental capacity increases.  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the installation cost
of sulfur dioxide scrubbers and other pollution control equipment, which
comprise most of the "Environmental" expenditures noted above.

PPL plans
to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2008 with cash on hand, cash from
operations and the issuance of debt securities.

Contractual
Obligations

PPL has
assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of
conducting its business.  At December 31, 2007, the estimated

Dividends

PPL views
dividend growth as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to
continue its trend of common stock dividend increases.  In 2007, PPL
increased the annualized dividend rate on its common stock from $1.10 to $1.22
per share, effective with the April 1, 2007 dividend payment.  In
2008, PPL increased the annualized dividend rate on its common stock from $1.22
to $1.34 per share, effective with the April 1, 2008 dividend
payment.  Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the
Board of Directors and will depend upon available earnings, cash flows,
financial requirements and other relevant factors at the time.  As
discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, PPL may not declare or pay any
cash dividend on its common stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding
defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due
2067.

PPL
Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

See Note
8 to the Financial Statements for other restrictions related to distributions on
capital interests for PPL subsidiaries.

Common
Stock Repurchase

Given its
strong internal cash flows and credit profile, PPL expects to repurchase
additional shares of its common stock beginning in 2009, absent better
opportunities to enhance shareowner value at that time through business growth
investments.  Any such repurchases will require the approval of PPL's
Board of Directors.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
preferred securities of PPL and its subsidiaries.  Based on their
respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings
revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it
issues.  The credit ratings of PPL and its subsidiaries are based on
information provided by PPL and other sources.  The ratings of
Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any
securities of PPL or its subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to
revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated
independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the
securities.  A downgrade in PPL's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings
could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
markets.

following table summarizes the credit ratings of PPL and its rated subsidiaries

The
rating agencies took the following actions related to PPL and its rated
subsidiaries in 2007:

Ratings
Triggers

PPL
Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are convertible upon
the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term credit ratings
assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB and Ba2, or
either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes.  The terms of the
notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the
notes.  See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information
concerning the Convertible Senior Notes.

WPD
(South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material
adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD
(South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled $943 million at December
31, 2007.

PPL and
its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity exposures caused by a
ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would accelerate the due dates
of borrowings.  However, if PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's debt ratings
had been below investment grade at December 31, 2007, PPL and PPL Energy Supply
would have had to post an additional $132 million of collateral to
counterparties.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

PPL
provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements
that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees contain
financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the
consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time,
PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding
sources.

PPL has
entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of FIN 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
34."  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
guarantees.

Risk
Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
Risk

Background

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL may incur as a result of price changes associated
with a particular financial or commodity instrument.  PPL is exposed
to market risk from:

PPL has a
risk management policy approved by its Board of Directors to manage market risk
and counterparty credit risk.  Credit risk is discussed
below.  The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the
Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations and
other risk measurement metrics.

The
forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur
in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on
model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from
those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of
expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible
losses.

Contract
Valuation

PPL
utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured
deals, such as tolling agreements, as part of its risk management strategy to
minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price,
interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

When available, quoted
market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial
instrument.  This may include exchange prices, quotes obtained from
brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source, such as a
bank.  However, market prices for energy or energy-related contracts
may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity.  If no
active trading market exists, contract valuations may include the use of
internally developed models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal
group.  Although PPL believes that its valuation methods are
reasonable, changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly
different values and realization in future periods.

To record
energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL discounts the forward values, as
appropriate, using the U.S. Utility BBB Curve.  Additionally, PPL
adjusts derivative carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty
credit quality, potential market illiquidity for net open positions and the risk
that modeled values may be inaccurate, as follows:

Accounting
and Reporting

To
account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted (together, "SFAS 133"); EITF
02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities;" and EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading
Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3."  In accordance with SFAS 133,
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an
asset or liability (unless they meet SFAS 133's criteria for exclusion), and
changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

In
accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL reflects its net realized and unrealized gains
and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in
the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of Income.

In
accordance with EITF 03-11, non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at major
market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those
same delivery points.  A major market delivery point is any delivery
point with liquid pricing available.

These
contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  Short-term derivative
positions are included in "Current Assets" and "Current
Liabilities."  Long-term derivative positions are included in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other
Noncurrent Liabilities."

Accounting
Designation

Energy
contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
treatment.  For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a
derivative, the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy
transactions are entered into determine their accounting
designation.  In addition to commodity transactions, PPL enters into
financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest
expense and foreign currency risk associated with both existing and anticipated
debt issuances.  PPL also enters into foreign currency swap contracts
to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and
net investments in foreign operations.  As with commodity
transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the
transaction determine a contract's accounting designation.  These
designations are verified by an independent internal group on a daily
basis.  See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a summary of the
guidelines used for the designation of derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
price risk is one of PPL's most significant risks due to the level of investment
that PPL maintains in its generation assets.  Several factors
influence price levels and volatilities.  These factors include, but
are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available
generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability
within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of
current and potential federal and state regulations.

To hedge
the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL's energy-related assets,
liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs
throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
over-the-counter contracts.  PPL's non-trading commodity derivative
contracts mature at various times through 2017.  PPL segregates its
non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and
economic activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge
activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133.  The
majority of PPL's energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge
accounting.  The economic activity category includes transactions that
address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which
hedge accounting was not elected.  Included in this category are
certain load-following energy obligations and related supply contracts, FTRs,
crude oil swaps to hedge rail transportation charges and hedges of synthetic
fuel tax credits.  Although they do not receive hedge accounting
treatment, these contracts are considered non-trading activity.  The
fair value of economic activity at December 31, 2007, including net premiums on
options, was $67 million.

Within
PPL's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy contracts is
influenced by the expected value of PPL's generation.  In determining
the number of MWhs that are available to be sold forward, PPL reduces the
maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors - planned
maintenance, unplanned outages and economic conditions.  The potential
output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due
to planned maintenance on a particular unit.  Another reduction,
representing the unplanned outage rate, is the amount of MWhs that historically
is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment
breakage.  Finally, the potential output of certain plants (such as
peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow
them to economically run during all hours.

PPL's
non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts that
qualify for accrual accounting.  The net obligation to serve these
contracts changes minute by minute.  Anticipated usage patterns and
energy peaks are affected by expected load changes, regional economic drivers
and seasonality.  PPL analyzes historical on-peak and off-peak usage
patterns, expected load changes, regional economic drivers, and weather
patterns, among other factors, to determine a monthly level of a block of
electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings
volatility.  To satisfy its full requirements obligations, PPL may
enter into contracts to purchase unbundled products of electricity, capacity,
renewable energy credits and other ancillary products.  Alternatively,
PPL may reserve a block amount of generation for full requirements contracts
that is expected to be the best match with anticipated usage patterns and energy
peaks.  The majority of purchases to supply full requirements sales
contracts receive hedge accounting treatment.

Besides
energy commodities, PPL implemented a program in 2006 to hedge its exposures to
changes in market prices of certain metals necessary for the scrubbers PPL is
installing at the Brunner Island and Montour generating plants.  These
contracts qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

commodity derivative contracts.

positions and options in natural gas and electricity and natural gas basis swaps
at points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker quotes are
available.

The
"Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the value
of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as
a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the
market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC
broker.  This category includes the fair value of transactions
completed in auction markets, where contract prices represent the market value
for load-following bundled energy prices delivered at illiquid delivery
points.

Because
of PPL's efforts to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets, PPL
sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward
basis, resulting in open contractual positions.  If PPL were unable to
deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its
agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay
damages.  These damages would be based on the difference between the
market price and the contract price of the commodity.  Depending on
price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be
significant.  Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant
outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their
own counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could
affect PPL's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in
the market price of replacement energy.  Although PPL attempts to
mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully
meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for
failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance
in the future.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of
the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by approximately $513
million, compared with a decrease of $303 million at December 31,
2006.  For purposes of this calculation, an increase in the market
price for electricity is considered an adverse movement because PPL's
electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position, and a decrease in
the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement because PPL's
commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase
position.  PPL enters into those commodity contracts to reduce the
market risk inherent in the generation of electricity.

Starting
in 2007, PPL elected to use an alternative method for disclosing quantitative
information about certain market risk sensitive instruments.  This
method utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity price risk in its non-trading
and trading portfolios.  This approach is consistent with how PPL's
Risk Manager assesses the market risk of its commodity business.  VaR
is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss, under normal
market conditions, based on historical market price volatility.  PPL
calculates VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, which uses historical
data from the past 12 month period.  The VaR is the estimated nominal
loss of earnings based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence
interval.  At December 31, 2007, the VaR for PPL's non-trading
portfolio was $12 million.

Commodity
Price Risk (Trading)

PPL also
executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL may at times create a net open
position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do
not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The margins from
these trading activities are shown in the Statements of Income as "Net energy
trading margins."

PPL's
trading contracts mature at various times through 2012.  The following

contracts.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices
across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of
the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $27 million, compared with a
decrease of $37 million at December 31, 2006.

At
December 31, 2007, the VaR for PPL's trading portfolio was $3
million.

Synthetic
Fuel Tax Credit Risk

PPL
expected the high level and the volatility of crude oil prices to reduce the
amount of synthetic fuel tax credits it would receive through synthetic fuel
production.  The tax credits are reduced if the annual average
wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase-out
range.  The tax credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds
the phase-out range.  See "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax
Credits" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
the phase-out of the tax credits.

PPL
implemented a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of the variability of
cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel tax credits by
hedging the risk that 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead prices for domestic
crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

PPL had
net purchased options for 2007 to mitigate its tax credit phase-out risk due to
an increase of the average wellhead price in 2007.  These positions
did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  The settlement value
of these positions at December 31, 2007, was a gain of $100
million.  The proceeds were received in January 2008.

Commodity
Price Risk Summary

In
accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL does not completely hedge its
generation output or fuel requirements.  PPL estimates that for its
entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and physical and financial
energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices across all geographic
zones and time periods would not have a material effect on expected 2008 gross
margins.  Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices
would decrease expected 2008 gross margins by $20 million.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL and
its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations, which exposes
them to interest rate risk.  PPL utilizes various financial derivative
products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt
portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in treasury rates
(and interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation of future financing,
when appropriate.  Risk limits under the risk management program are
designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes
in the fair value of PPL's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level
of interest rates.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL's potential annual exposure to increased interest
expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $8 million, compared
with $10 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL is
also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt
portfolios.  At December 31, 2007, PPL estimated that its potential
exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10%
adverse movement in interest rates, was $336 million, which is comparable with
the amount at December 31, 2006.

PPL
utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the
expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments.  These
risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding
variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing.  While PPL is
exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any changes in the
fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified
into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects
earnings.  At December 31, 2007, the market value of these
instruments, representing the amount PPL would pay upon their termination, was
$12 million.  PPL estimated that its potential additional exposure to
a change in the fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement
in the hedged exposure, was $11 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $19
million at December 31, 2006.

PPL also
utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and
floating interest rates in its debt portfolio.  While PPL is exposed
to changes in the fair value of these instruments, any change in market value is
recorded with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being
hedged.  At December 31, 2007, the market value of these instruments,
representing the amount PPL would receive upon their termination, was $20
million.  PPL estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the
fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in interest
rates, was $19 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $18 million at
December 31, 2006.

WPDH
Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $527 million to
hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds
with maturity dates ranging from December 2008 to December 2028.  The
estimated value of this position at December 31, 2007, being the amount WPDH
Limited would pay to terminate it, including accrued interest, was $152
million.  At December 31, 2007, WPDH Limited estimated that its
potential additional exposure to a change in the market value of these
instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, was $122 million.  At December 31, 2006, the
potential additional exposure for the cross-currency swaps outstanding at that
time was $115 million for a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates.

Foreign
Currency Risk

PPL is
exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in U.K.
affiliates.  In addition, PPL's domestic operations may make purchases
of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

PPL has
adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain
foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or
liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.  In
addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign
currency translation risk of expected earnings.

In 2007,
PPL executed forward sale contracts totaling Â£98 million to protect the value of
a portion of its net investment in WPD.  The settlement dates of these
contracts range from January 2008 through June 2011.  At December 31,
2007, the market value of these positions, representing the amount PPL would
receive upon their termination, was $3 million.  PPL estimated that
its potential exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments,
through a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates, was $18
million at December 31, 2007.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear
station.  As of December 31, 2007, these funds were invested
primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities
and are reflected at fair value on PPL's Balance Sheet.  The mix of
securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund Susquehanna's
decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning
costs.  However, the equity securities included in the trusts are
exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate,
fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates.  PPL
actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset
allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy
statement.  At December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 10% increase in
interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an
estimated $40 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared
with a $38 million reduction at December 31, 2006.  See Note 21
to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds.

Defined
Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional
information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan
assets.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL would incur as a result of
nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations.  PPL maintains credit policies and procedures with
respect to counterparties (including requirements that counterparties maintain
certain credit ratings criteria) and requires other assurances in the form of
credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit
counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL has concentrations of
suppliers and customers among electric utilities, natural gas distribution
companies and other energy marketing and trading companies.  These
concentrations of counterparties may impact PPL's overall exposure to credit
risk, either positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly
affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.  As
discussed above in "Contract Valuation," PPL records certain nonperformance
reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are
out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint) will default in its
performance.  In this case, PPL would have to sell into a lower-priced
market or purchase from a higher-priced market.  These reserves are
reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in "Price risk management assets"
on the Balance Sheets.  PPL also records reserves to reflect the
probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries PPL has
made but not yet billed.  These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled
revenues" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL also has established a reserve
with respect to certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL has not yet
been paid, which is reflected in accounts receivable on the Balance
Sheets.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

Acquisitions,
Development and Divestitures

PPL
continuously evaluates strategic options for its business segments and, from
time to time, PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third
parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets, joint
ventures and development projects, which may or may not result in definitive
agreements.  Any such transactions may impact future financial
results.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the Financial Statements for
information regarding such recent transactions.

PPL is
currently planning incremental capacity increases of 331 MW at several existing
domestic generating facilities.  Offsetting this increase is an
expected 30 MW reduction in net generation capability at each of the Brunner
Island and Montour plants, due to the estimated increases in station service
usage during the scrubber operation.  See Note 15 to the Financial
Statements for additional information, as well as information regarding the
shutdown of two 150 MW generating units at Martins Creek in September
2007.

PPL

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL's
financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods,
assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting
policies.  The following accounting policies are particularly
important to the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, and
require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments included
within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the
information presented in the Financial Statements.  (These accounting
policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
Statements.)  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical
accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with its
Audit Committee.  In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed
the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting
policies with the Audit Committee.

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements."  Among other
things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for
measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157
through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to
FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair
Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under
Statement 13" and  FSP FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 157."  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its scope,
certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 delays the effective date of
SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
annually).

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL will partially adopt SFAS 157, as amended,
effective January 1, 2008.  The January 1, 2008 adoption, although not
expected to be significant, is expected to affect the fair value component of
PPL's critical accounting policies related to "Price Risk Management" and
"Defined Benefits" in future periods.  As permitted by this guidance,
PPL will adopt SFAS 157, as amended, effective January 1, 2009, for nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis.  The January
1, 2009 adoption could affect the fair value component of PPL's critical
accounting policies related to "Asset Impairment" and "Asset Retirement
Obligations."  See Note 23 to the Financial Statements for additional
information regarding SFAS 157, as amended.

Defined
Benefits

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans applicable to the majority of the employees of PPL and its
subsidiaries.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these defined
benefits.  In addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement
date provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31,
2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL and its
subsidiaries are required to record an asset or liability to recognize the
funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to other
comprehensive income (OCI) or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit
plans is now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL no longer recognizes
additional minimum liability adjustments in OCI.  See Note 13 to
the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the
accounting for defined benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated
results are recorded in OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  These amounts in accumulated OCI or regulatory assets
for certain regulated subsidiaries are amortized to income over future
periods.  This delayed recognition in income of actual results allows
for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who
benefit under the plans.  The primary assumptions are:

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL starts
with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 500 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$350 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2007, PPL increased the discount
rate for its domestic pension plans from 5.94% to 6.39% as a result of this
assessment and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit
plans from 5.88% to 6.26%.

A similar
process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its
base.  At December 31, 2007, PPL increased the discount rate for its
international pension plans from 5.17% to 6.37% as a result of this
assessment.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the
plans.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's expected return on plan assets was
reduced from 8.50% to 8.25% for its domestic pension plans and increased from
7.75% to 7.80% for its other postretirement benefit plans.  For its
international plans, PPL's expected return on plan assets was reduced from 8.09%
to 7.90% at December 31, 2007.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's
rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic
plans.  For its international plans, PPL's rate of compensation
increase was increased from 4.0% to 4.25% at December 31, 2007.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's
health care cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2008, gradually declining to 5.5% for
2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated
subsidiaries.  While the charts below reflect either an increase or
decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would impact the accrued
defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined
benefit costs and OCI or regulatory assets for certain regulated subsidiaries by
a similar amount in the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below
reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption
and does not include income tax effects.

In 2007,
PPL recognized net periodic defined benefit costs charged to operating expenses
of $102 million.  This amount represents a $17 million increase from
2006.  This increase in expense was primarily attributable to PPL's
international plans and increased amortization from accumulated OCI of prior
losses.

Asset
      Impairment

PPL
performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including intangibles, which
are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with SFAS 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  PPL
tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a
long-lived asset's carrying value may not be recoverable.  Examples of
such events or changes in circumstances are:

For a
long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum
of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset.  If the asset is impaired, an
impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its
estimated fair value.

In
determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
value of the assets and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those
identified and recorded in the financial statements.  For determining
fair value, the FASB has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets
are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are
unavailable, other valuation techniques may be used.  PPL has
generally used discounted cash flow to estimate fair
value.  Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash
flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present
value of the cash flow streams.

PPL has
determined that, when considering alternative courses of action to recover the
carrying value of a long-lived asset, it uses estimated cash flows from the
"most likely" approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is clearly the
most likely outcome.  If no scenario is clearly most likely, then a
probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash
flows from the alternative scenarios.  For assets tested for
impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used
in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the
balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the future
sale of the assets.  That assessment made as of the balance sheet date
is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet
date.

In 2007,
PPL recorded impairments of certain long-lived assets.  See Note 9 to
the Financial Statements for a discussion of the impairment of PPL's domestic
telecommunication assets, Note 10 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
of the impairment of certain Latin American businesses and the natural gas
distribution and propane businesses, and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
a discussion of the impairment of certain transmission
rights.

PPL
performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets."  SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested
for impairment at the reporting unit level.  PPL has determined its
reporting units to be at or one level below its operating
segments.  PPL performs an annual impairment test for goodwill, or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair
value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired.  If the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The
second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of
goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That
is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was
the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied
fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying
value of that goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the implied
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the
reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2007,
no second-step assessments were required for goodwill in any reporting
units.  PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill
impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair
values.  PPL estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted
cash flows.  For the U.K. reporting unit, an increase of the discount
rate by 25 basis points or a 10% reduction in cash flows would have resulted in
the failure of the first-step assessment and required the performance of the
second-step assessment.  The second-step assessment would have
required a purchase price allocation based on the guidance from SFAS 141,
"Business Combinations."  It would have taken a significant change in
the fair value of the assets and liabilities of WPD to result in an impairment
of goodwill in the second-step assessment.  A decrease in the
forecasted cash flows of 10% or an increase of the discount rates by 25 basis
points for the other goodwill tests would not have resulted in an impairment of
goodwill in other reporting units.

PPL also
performs a review of the residual value of leased assets in accordance with SFAS
13, "Accounting for Leases."  PPL tests the residual value of these
assets annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that a leased asset's residual value may have declined.  The
residual value is defined by SFAS 13 as the estimated fair value of the leased
property at the end of the lease term.  If the review produces a lower
estimate of residual value than was originally recorded, PPL is required to
determine whether the decline is other than temporary.  If it is other
than temporary, the residual value will be revised using the new
estimate.  This reduction in the residual value will be recognized as
a loss in the period in which the estimate was changed.  If the review
provides a higher estimate of residual value than was originally recorded, no
adjustment will be made.

In
testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
assumptions to estimate:  future cash flows; the useful lives of the
leased assets; fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in
significantly different outcomes from those identified and recorded in the
financial statements.  PPL uses discounted cash flow to determine the
estimated fair value of the leased assets at the end of the lease
term.

In 2007,
PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain leased
assets.  This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes to the
residual value.  PPL's estimate was based on using projections of
electric and fuel prices and any firm sale and purchase
agreements.  An increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points or a
10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would not have resulted in a
reduction of the residual value of these leased assets.

4)

Leasing

PPL
applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," to all leasing
transactions.  In addition, PPL applies the provisions of numerous
other accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the EITF that provide
specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various
leasing arrangements.  In general, there are two types of leases from
a lessee's perspective:  operating leases (leases accounted for
off-balance sheet); and capital leases (leases capitalized on the balance
sheet).

In
accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or
capital.  Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference
between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital
lease, thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the
financial statements.

In
addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
they involve:  real estate and/or related integral equipment;
sale/leaseback accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously
owned the leased assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating
lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax
accounting purposes); and lessee involvement in the construction of leased
assets.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
transaction.  In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the
Colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to
PPL Montana under four 36-year leases.  This transaction is accounted
for as an operating lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements
related to sale/leaseback arrangements.  If for any reason this
transaction did not meet the requirements for off-balance sheet operating lease
treatment as a sale/leaseback, PPL would have recorded approximately $231
million of additional assets and approximately $292 million of additional
liabilities on its balance sheet at December 31, 2007, and would have recorded
additional expenses estimated at $6 million, after-tax, in 2007.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
leases.

5)

Loss
      Accruals

PPL
periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions,
situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes.  PPL's
accounting for such events is prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting for
Contingencies," and other related accounting guidance.  SFAS 5 defines
a contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances
involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will
ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  SFAS 5 does not permit the
accrual of contingencies that might result in gains.  PPL continuously
assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation
claims, regulatory penalties and other events.

PPL also
has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
events have occurred.  For example, estimated losses were accrued when
long-term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements
and when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.  Under
regulatory accounting, PPL Electric recorded the above-market cost of energy
purchases from NUGs as part of its purchased power costs on an as-incurred
basis, since these costs were recovered in regulated rates.  When the
generation business was deregulated, the estimated loss associated with these
long-term purchase commitments to make above-market NUG purchases was recorded
because PPL Electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market
prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated
rates.  PPL considers these losses to be similar to asset impairments
or inventory write-downs.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include:  (1) the
initial identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of
triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing
assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All
three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant
judgment by PPL's management.

Initial Identification and
Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL uses
its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers), as
necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and
the amount (or range) of the loss.

Two
significant loss accruals were initially recorded in 2005.  One was
the loss accrual related to the PJM billing dispute.  Another involved
the accrual of remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the
Martins Creek generating station.  Significant judgment was required
by PPL's management to perform the initial assessment of these
contingencies.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on both of these
contingencies and see "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" below for a
discussion of the year-end assessments of these contingencies.

There
were no significant loss accruals initially recorded in 2007 or
2006.

PPL has
identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but that do not
meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5.  SFAS 5 requires
disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is "reasonably
possible" that a loss has been incurred.  The FASB defines "reasonably
possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or events occurring
is more than remote but less than likely."  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that
have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS 5.

Reducing Recorded Loss
Accruals

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL identifies, where applicable, the triggering
events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The triggering
events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual
loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

The
largest loss accrual on PPL's balance sheet, and the loss accrual that changed
most significantly in 2007, was for an impairment of above-market NUG purchase
commitments.  This loss accrual reflects the estimated difference
between the above-market contract terms, under the purchase commitments, and the
expected fair value of the electricity to be purchased at the date these
contracts were impaired.  This loss accrual was originally recorded at
$879 million in 1998, when PPL Electric's generation business was
deregulated.

When the
loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be
reduced.  A schedule was established to reduce the liability based on
projected purchases over the lives of the NUG contracts.  This loss
accrual was transferred to PPL EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000, corporate
realignment.  PPL EnergyPlus continues to reduce the above-market NUG
liability based on the aforementioned schedule.  As PPL EnergyPlus
reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases, it offsets the actual
cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in
line with expected market prices.  The above-market loss accrual was
$71 million at December 31, 2007.  This loss accrual will be
significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts
expires.  The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in
2014.

Ongoing Assessment of
Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded
potential loss exposures are sufficient.  This involves ongoing
communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers,
operation management and other parties.

As part
of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL's management
re-assessed the loss accruals recorded in 2005, for the two contingencies
described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
Accrual."

Â·

In
      December 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC, pursuant to a
      November 2006 order, a modified offer of settlement (Compliance
      Filing).  Under the Compliance Filing, PPL Electric would make a
      single payment through its monthly PJM bill of $38 million, plus interest
      through the date of payment, and PJM would include a single credit for
      this amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill.  Through December 31,
      2006, the estimated interest on this payment was $4 million, for a total
      payment of $42 million.  Based on the Compliance Filing, PPL
      reduced the recorded loss accrual by $5 million at December 31,
      2006.

In
      March 2007, the FERC entered an order approving the Compliance
      Filing.  In April 2007, PPL Electric paid PJM the full
      settlement amount of $43 million, including additional interest of $1
      million recorded during the three months ended March 31,
      2007.  This proceeding is now terminated and no contingency
      exists at December 31, 2007.

Â·

In
      2005, PPL also re-assessed the contingency for the Martins Creek ash basin
      remediation.  Based on the ongoing remediation efforts and
      communications with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate agencies,
      at December 31, 2005, PPL's management concluded that $48 million was the
      best estimate of the cost of the remediation effort.

In
      2006, PPL reduced the estimate of costs to $37 million, primarily due to
      an insurance claim settlement.  At December 31, 2007,
      management's best estimate of the probable loss associated with the
      Martins Creek ash basin leak remains at $37 million.  Based on
      actual costs incurred and recorded to date, at December 31, 2007, the
      remaining contingency for this remediation was $9 million.  PPL
      cannot predict the final cost of the remediation, the outcome of the
      action initiated by the Pennsylvania DEP, the outcome of the natural
      resource damage assessment, the outcome of the lawsuit brought by the
      citizens and businesses and the exact nature of any other regulatory or
      other legal actions that may be initiated against PPL as a result of the
      disposal basin leak.  PPL also cannot predict with certainty the
      extent of the fines or damages that may be sought in connection with any
      such actions or the ultimate financial impact on PPL.  PPL's
      management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency
      in future periods.

6)

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

SFAS 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
liability in the financial statements.  The initial obligation should
be measured at the estimated fair value.  An equivalent amount should
be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated
to expense over the useful life of the asset.  Until the obligation is
settled, the liability should be increased, through the recognition of accretion
expense in the income statement, for changes in the obligation due to the
passage of time.

FIN 47,
"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 143," clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS
143.  FIN 47 specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when
incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to
calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed through consideration
of estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the
anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was
incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different
results than those identified and recorded in the financial
statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect
the carrying value of various AROs and the related assets, are reviewed
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the
latest estimate of the obligations.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL had AROs totaling $376 million recorded on the Balance
Sheet.  Of this amount, $298 million or 79% relates to PPL's nuclear
decommissioning ARO.  PPL's most significant assumptions surrounding
AROs are the forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates and the inflation
rates.  A variance in the forecasted retirement costs, the discount
rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact on the ARO
liabilities.

The
following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear
decommissioning ARO liability at PPL as of December 31, 2007, associated
with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial
recognition.  There is no significant change to the annual
depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO
liability as a result of changing the assumptions.  Each sensitivity
below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
assumption.

Income
      Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL's provision for income
taxes.  This is primarily due to uncertainty in various tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the determination of deferred tax
assets, liabilities and valuation allowances and estimating the phase-out range
for synthetic fuel tax credits that is not published by the IRS until April of
the following year.

Prior to
January 1, 2007, and in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
PPL evaluated uncertain tax positions and accrued charges for probable exposures
based on management's best estimate of the amount of benefit that should be
recognized in the financial statements.  This assessment resulted in
management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax
year.  In addition, management considered the reversal of temporary
differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in initially recording and reevaluating the need for valuation
allowances.

In June
2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."  In May 2007, the FASB
amended this guidance by issuing FSP FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No. 48."  PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48, as
amended, effective January 1, 2007.  The adoption of FIN 48 alters the
methodology PPL previously used to account for income tax
uncertainties.  Effective with the adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax
positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in accordance
with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 continues to require significant management judgment in
determining the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain
tax position.  FIN 48 requires PPL to evaluate its tax positions
following a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to
determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax
position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50 percent chance) that the
tax position will be sustained.  This determination assumes that the
relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the
relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires
an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position
that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  The
measurement of the benefit equals the largest amount of benefit that has a
likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50
percent.  PPL's management considers a number of factors in assessing
the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a
settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL reassesses its uncertain tax positions by considering
information known at the reporting date.  Based on management's
assessment of new information, PPL may subsequently recognize a tax benefit for
a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize a previously recognized tax
position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously recognized tax
position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues
raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and
may materially impact PPL's financial statements in the future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by paying cash, within one year of the reporting
date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated
each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of
a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in
assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of
temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this
assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding synthetic
fuel tax credits.

PPL ENERGY SUPPLY, LLC

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
Energy Supply is an energy company with headquarters in Allentown,
PA.  Please refer to Exhibit 99(a) in Item 15 for a listing of its
principal subsidiaries and to "Item 1. Business - Background," for descriptions
of PPL Energy Supply's domestic and international businesses.  PPL
Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International
Delivery.  Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply is primarily
engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets - the
northeastern and western U.S. - and in the delivery of electricity in the
U.K.  In 2007, PPL sold its regulated electricity delivery businesses
in Latin America, which were included in the International Delivery
segment.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on
the sales.  PPL Energy Supply's overall strategy is to achieve
disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both
cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable, long-term growth in
the regulated international electricity delivery business through efficient
operations and strong customer and regulatory relations.  More
specifically, PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its electricity generation and
marketing business is to match energy supply with load, or customer demand,
under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture
profits while effectively managing exposure to energy and fuel price volatility
and counterparty credit risk.  PPL Energy Supply's strategy for its
international electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these
businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining high quality customer
service and reliability.

PPL
Energy Supply faces several risks in its generation business.  The
principal risks are electricity and capacity wholesale price risk, fuel supply
and price risk, power plant performance, evolving regulatory frameworks and
counterparty credit risk.  PPL Energy Supply attempts to manage these
risks through various means.  For instance, PPL Energy Supply operates
a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography, fuel
source, cost structure and operating characteristics.  PPL Energy
Supply currently expects to expand its generation capacity over the next several
years through power uprates at certain of its existing power plants, the
potential construction of new plants and the potential acquisition of existing
plants or businesses.  PPL Energy Supply is and will continue to
remain focused on the operating efficiency and availability of its existing and
any newly constructed or acquired power plants.  In addition, PPL
Energy Supply has executed and continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths
for energy sales and fuel supply, and other means to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse changes in the difference, or margin, between the cost
to produce electricity and the price at which PPL Energy Supply sells
it.  PPL Energy Supply's future profitability will be affected by
whether PPL Energy Supply decides to, or is able to, continue to enter into
long-term or intermediate-term power sales and fuel purchase agreements or renew
its existing agreements and prevailing market conditions.  Currently,
PPL Energy Supply's commitments for energy sales are satisfied through its own
generation assets and supply purchased from third parties.  PPL Energy
Supply markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets
through integrated generation, marketing and trading functions.

PPL
Energy Supply has in place risk management programs that, among other things,
are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to earnings and cash flow
volatility related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating
performance of its generating units.

The
principal challenge that PPL Energy Supply faces in its international
electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high quality customer service and
reliability in a cost-effective manner.  PPL Energy Supply's
international electricity delivery businesses are
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, these businesses are subject to
regulatory risk with respect to the costs that may be recovered and investment
returns that may be collected through customer rates.  PPL Energy
Supply faces additional financial risks in conducting international operations,
such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  PPL Energy
Supply attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management
programs.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL
Energy Supply's business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit
profile.  PPL Energy Supply continually focuses on maintaining an
appropriate capital structure and liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning the material risks that PPL
Energy Supply faces in its businesses.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Energy Supply's
past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing
the risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

The
information provided in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with PPL
Energy Supply's Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying
Notes.

Segment

The
Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, domestic
generation and domestic development operations of PPL Energy
Supply.  In August 2007, PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its
domestic telecommunication operations.  See Note 9 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

The
Supply segment results in 2006 and 2005 reflect the reclassification of PPL
Energy Supply's interest in the Griffith plant's operating revenues and expenses
from certain income statement line items to Discontinued
Operations.  The Supply segment results in 2005 also reflect the
reclassification of the Sundance plant's revenues and expenses to Discontinued
Operations.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

(a)

The
      mark-to-market impact on transactions, which do not qualify for hedge
      accounting under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
      Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted, and are probable of going
      to physical delivery, is economically neutral to PPL Energy
      Supply.  These transactions are intended to economically hedge a
      specific risk and do not represent speculative trading
      activity.  See "Changes in Domestic Gross Energy Margins by
      Region" and Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information
      regarding economic activity.

(b)

In
      the first quarter of 2005, PPL Energy Supply recognized a charge for a
      loss contingency related to litigation with NorthWestern.  In
      September 2005, PPL Energy Supply and NorthWestern reached a final
      agreement to settle this
litigation.

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL Energy Supply projects lower 2008 earnings for its Supply
segment compared with 2007 as a result of the loss of synfuel-related earnings
and higher depreciation for scrubbers being installed at both coal-fired
generation units at the Montour power plant and at Unit 3 of the Brunner Island
power plant, which are expected to be placed in service in 2008.  PPL
Energy Supply expects these negative effects to be partially offset by higher
energy margins as a result of higher-valued wholesale energy contracts and
higher expected baseload generation compared with 2007.

International Delivery
Segment

The
International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
electricity.  PPL Global's major remaining international business is
located in the U.K.  In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Latin
American businesses.  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

The
International Delivery segment results in 2007, 2006 and 2005 reflect the
reclassification of Latin American revenues and expenses to Discontinued
Operations.

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL Energy Supply projects the earnings of its International
Delivery segment will decline in 2008 compared with 2007, due to the 2007 sale
of PPL Energy Supply's Latin American businesses and higher U.S. income taxes,
primarily driven by the U.S. income tax benefits realized in
2007.  Partially offsetting the impact of these negative earnings
drivers is lower pension expense at WPD.

      include revenues and energy costs related to the international operations
      of PPL Global, revenues prior to 2007 associated with the settlement of
      Wallingford cost-based rates (see Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
      additional information) and an accrual for the loss contingency related to
      the PJM billing dispute in 2005 and 2006 (see Note 15 to the Financial

      included in "Other operation and maintenance" expenses on the Statements
      of Income.

Changes in Domestic Gross
Energy Margins By Region

Domestic
gross energy margins are generated through PPL Energy Supply's non-trading and
trading activities.  PPL Energy Supply manages its non-trading energy
business on a geographic basis that is aligned with its generation
assets.  Additionally, beginning in 2006, PPL Energy Supply further
segregates non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity
and economic activity.  Economic activity represents the net
unrealized effect of derivative transactions that are entered into as economic
hedges, and that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or for which hedge
accounting was not elected, under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted.

$


Eastern
U.S.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $119 million higher in 2007 compared with 2006. This
increase was primarily due to new full requirements supply contracts and higher
wholesale market prices for electricity.  Also contributing to the
improvement was increased generation output from PPL Energy Supply's nuclear and
coal generating facilities.  Nuclear generation was 2% higher in
2007.  Coal generation was up slightly in 2007 despite the retirement
of Martins Creek Units 1 and 2 in September.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $61 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This change relates to gains in electricity positions,
including a $19 million increase in the fair value of capacity contracts in PJM
related to PJM's implementation of its Reliability Pricing Model
(RPM).  Prior to the RPM, PPL Energy Supply recorded valuation
reserves for capacity contracts due to the lack of liquidity and reliable,
observable prices in the marketplace.  With the implementation of the
RPM and the completion of PJM capacity auctions, forward capacity prices became
sufficiently observable and PPL Energy Supply no longer reserves for capacity
contracts in PJM.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $166 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
due to higher PLR sales prices and higher wholesale prices.  PLR sales
prices were 8.4% higher in 2006, in accordance with the schedule established by
the PUC Final Order.  Partially offsetting these higher margins was
lower nuclear generation of 3%, as well as higher coal and nuclear fuel prices,
which were up 12% and 10%.

Eastern
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $5 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005.

Western
U.S.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $30 million higher in 2007 compared with
2006.  This increase was primarily due to higher market prices for
electricity combined with increased generation from the coal-fired generating
facilities.  Coal generation was 6% higher in 2007.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $3 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins, excluding results from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness, were $10 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily
due to higher wholesale prices.  Also contributing to the increase was
a 6% increase in hydroelectric generation.  Partially offsetting these
improvements were higher coal prices, which were up 14%, and the sale of PPL
Energy Supply's 50% interest in the Griffith plant in June 2006 and the sale of
PPL Energy Supply's Sundance plant in May 2005.  See Note 10 to the
Financial Statements for additional information on these sales.

Western
U.S. non-trading margins that resulted from economic activity and hedge
ineffectiveness were $2 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005.

Net
Energy Trading

PPL
Energy Supply enters into energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a
net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if
prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The
margins from these trading activities are reflected in the Statements of Income
as "Net energy trading margins."  These physical and financial
contracts cover trading activity associated with electricity, gas and
oil.

Net
energy trading margins decreased by $6 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  Energy trading margins from realized transactions decreased $10
million and were partially offset by an increase in unrealized transactions of
$4 million.

Net
energy trading margins increased by $13 million in 2006 compared with
2005.  Energy trading margins from unrealized transactions increased
$14 million and were partially offset by a decrease in realized transactions of
$1 million.  This change in unrealized transactions was primarily due
to contracts reclassified as trading activity from hedge (non-trading)
transactions related to the Griffith plant after the announced plan to sell PPL
Energy Supply's interest in the plant.

Higher
U.K. utility revenues for 2007 compared with 2006, excluding foreign currency
exchange rate impacts, were primarily due to an increase in prices effective
April 1, 2007, favorable changes in customer mix and an increase in engineering
services performed for third parties.  The increase was partially
offset by a 3% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to milder weather in
2007.

Higher
U.K. utility revenues for 2006 compared with 2005, excluding foreign currency

Energy-related
Businesses

Energy-related
businesses contributed $29 million more to operating income in 2007 compared
with 2006.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Â·

$61
      million of higher pre-tax contributions from synfuel
      projects.  This reflects a $66 million net gain on the
      settlement of options purchased to hedge the risk associated with the
      phase-out of the synthetic fuel tax credits and an impairment charge of
      $10 million on the synfuel-related assets in 2006, partially offset by $15
      million of higher operating losses due to higher production levels in
      2007; and

Â·

a
      $9 million increase related to PPL Energy Supply's mechanical contracting
      and engineering subsidiaries; partially offset by

Â·

a
      $39 million impairment of domestic telecommunication assets that were sold
      in August 2007 (see Note 9 to the Financial
  Statements).

Energy-related
businesses contributed $21 million more to operating income in 2006 compared
with 2005.  The increase was primarily attributable to:

Â·

$18
      million of lower pre-tax losses from synfuel projects.  This
      reflects $29 million of lower operating losses due to lower production
      levels, partially offset by an impairment charge of $10 million recorded
      in 2006 on the synfuel-related assets; and

Â·

a
      $3 million increase from its domestic telecommunications subsidiary, due
      to an increase in transport-related sales, as well as reduced spending on
      a product line (before depreciation, interest expense, and income
      taxes).

Discontinued
Operations

In the
second quarter of 2007, PPL Energy Supply recorded an $89 million gain, net of a
$5 million tax expense, in connection with the sale of its El Salvadoran
regulated electricity delivery business.  In the third quarter of
2007, PPL Energy Supply also sold its Bolivian businesses.  In
connection with this sale, PPL Energy Supply recorded a $20 million impairment,
net of a $17 million tax benefit.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, PPL
Energy Supply recorded a $197 million gain, net of a $109 million tax expense,
in connection with the sale of its Chilean business.

In 2006,
PPL Energy Supply recorded a $23 million loss, net of a $16 million tax benefit,
in connection with the sale of its ownership interest in the Griffith
plant.  Also included in Discontinued Operations is the acceleration
of $7 million, after tax, of net unrealized gains on derivatives associated with
the Griffith plant.

In 2005,
PPL Energy Supply recorded a $47 million loss, net of a $26 million tax benefit,
in connection with the sale of its Sundance plant.

See Note
10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the above sales,
and information regarding operating results recorded prior to the
sales.

Cumulative
Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

In 2005,
PPL Energy Supply adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143."  FIN 47
clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value
of a conditional ARO when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be
reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an
ARO.  Application of the interpretation resulted in a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle that decreased net income by $8
million in 2005.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for
additional information.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

PPL
Energy Supply is focused on maintaining its investment grade credit profile by
maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and a strong balance
sheet.  PPL Energy Supply believes that its cash on hand, short-term
investments, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and
borrowing capacity, taken as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund its
ongoing operating requirements, future security maturities and estimated future
capital expenditures.  PPL Energy Supply currently expects cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments at the end of 2008 to be approximately
$400 million and expects to increase its credit facilities up to approximately
$5.0 billion in 2008.  However, PPL Energy Supply's cash flows from
operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to
risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to:

At
December 31, PPL Energy Supply had the following:

      and cash equivalents

Short-term
      investments

$


$


Short-term
      debt

$


$


At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply had $10 million of auction rate securities
in its portfolio of short-term investments.  Recent investor concerns
over insurers who guarantee the credit of certain of the underlying securities
and other conditions have resulted in some investors of auction rate securities
being unable to sell such securities at auction.  This has resulted in
investors continuing to own these securities, generally at higher interest
rates, until the subsequent auction.  As of December 31, 2007, PPL
Energy Supply did not have material exposure to loss given the high quality of
the underlying securities and the amount of auction rate securities
held.

The
changes in PPL Energy Supply's cash and cash equivalents position resulted

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased by 12%, or $146 million, in 2007
compared with 2006, primarily as a result of increased expenditures for fuel and
increased U.S. income tax payments, a portion of which related to taxes incurred
in connection with the sale of PPL Energy Supply's Latin American
businesses.  These increased uses of cash were partially offset by
higher revenues in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily related to higher
wholesale market prices for electricity in the U.S. and increased sales volumes
to PPL Electric under the PLR contracts to support the PLR load.

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased by 48%, or $402 million, in 2006
compared with 2005, primarily as a result of an 8.4% increase in sales prices
under the PLR contracts and increased international delivery revenues,
predominantly related to price increases and changes in customer
mix.  The increase from 2005 to 2006 was also due, to a lesser extent,
to reduced expenditures for oil in 2006 as a result of building up inventory in
2005.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues
under the PLR contracts resulting from a decrease in sales volumes, due in part
to milder weather in 2006, increased expenditures for coal and increased U.S.
income tax payments, primarily due to lower utilization of foreign tax credits
in 2006.

PPL
Energy Supply expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating
activities as a result of its power sales commitments from wholesale and retail
customers and long-term fuel purchase contracts.  PPL Energy Supply
estimates that, on average, approximately 91% of its expected annual generation
output for the period 2008 through 2009 is committed under power sales
contracts.  PPL Energy Supply has and will continue to layer in power
sales contracts in the wholesale markets for the capacity and energy currently
committed under the PLR supply contracts with PPL Electric, which expire at the
end of 2009.  Based on the way in which the wholesale markets have
developed over the last several years, PPL Energy Supply expects that new
contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter duration than the PLR supply
contracts, which at inception had terms of approximately nine
years.

PPL
Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel
often require cash collateral or other credit enhancements, or reductions or
terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the
event of a downgrade of PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's credit ratings
or adverse changes in market prices.  For example, in addition to
limiting its trading ability, if PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiary's ratings
were lowered to below "investment grade" and energy prices increased by 10%, PPL
Energy Supply estimates that, based on its December 31, 2007 positions, it would
have had to post additional collateral of approximately $829 million, compared
with $387 million at December 31, 2006.  PPL Energy Supply has in
place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its
exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel
prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit
quality and the operating performance of its generating units.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2007 and projected expenditures for the years 2008
through 2012.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 76%, or $956 million, in 2007 compared
with 2006 primarily as a result of aggregate proceeds of $898 million received
from the sale of PPL Energy Supply's Latin American businesses and
telecommunication operations in 2007 compared to $110 million received from the
sale of its interest in the Griffith plant in 2006, as well as a change of $529
million from purchases and sales of short-term investments and a change of $104
million from purchases and sales of emission allowances.  These
increases were partially offset by an increase of $326 million in capital
expenditures, primarily as a result of the construction of pollution control
equipment at coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, and an increase of $96 million
in the additional amount of cash that became restricted.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 135%, or $724 million, in 2006 compared
with 2005.  There were a few items that contributed to this
increase.  Capital expenditures increased $440 million, primarily as a
result of the construction of pollution control equipment at coal-fired plants
in Pennsylvania, as discussed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements, and $29
million related to the purchase of leased equipment.  See Note 11 to
the Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2006 purchase of leased
equipment in connection with the termination of the related master lease
agreements.  Additionally, there was a change of $312 million from
purchases and sales of short-term investments, and PPL Energy Supply received
$80 million less in proceeds from the sale of power plants in 2006 compared with
2005.  The impact of the above items was partially offset by a change
of $75 million from purchases and sales of emission allowances.

Financing
Activities

Net cash
used in financing activities was $963 million in 2007, compared with net cash
provided by financing activities of $315 million in 2006 and net cash used in
financing activities of $437 million in 2005.  The change from 2006 to
2007 primarily reflects reduced issuances of long-term debt and increased
distributions to Member in 2007 in support of the repurchase of PPL common stock
under PPL's stock repurchase program.  The change from 2005 to 2006
primarily reflects increased issuances of long-term debt in 2006.

In 2007,
cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of
$180 million and $1.5 billion of distributions to Member, partially offset by
$700 million in contributions from Member.  In 2006, cash provided by
financing activities primarily consisted of net debt issuances of $950 million
and $115 million of contributions from Member, partially offset by $712 million
in distributions to Member.  In 2005, cash used in financing
activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of $200 million,
including affiliate debt, and $278 million of distributions to Member, partially
offset by $50 million in contributions from Member.

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
Energy Supply expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available
in the near term, including various credit facilities, a commercial paper
program, operating leases and contributions from Member.  PPL Energy
Supply also expects to continue to have access to debt capital markets, as
necessary, for its long-term financing needs.

Credit
Facilities

In
addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, these credit
agreements contain various other covenants.  Failure to comply with
the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of
repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  PPL
Energy Supply monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular
basis.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply was in material
compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply
believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit
access to these funding sources.

During
2008, PPL Energy Supply intends to maintain its existing credit facility
capacity, which may require the renewal and extension of certain
facilities.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply expects to increase its
credit facility capacity by up to $500 million in 2008 to support potential
collateral requirements under contracts that it expects to enter into in
connection with expanding its wholesale marketing and trading
business.  See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of PPL Energy Supply's credit facilities.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million to
provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
if and when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by
certain credit agreements of PPL Energy Supply.  PPL Energy Supply had
no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  During
2008, PPL Energy Supply may issue commercial paper from time to time to
facilitate short-term cash flow needs.  Additionally, PPL Energy
Supply expects to increase the size of its commercial paper program to $1.0
billion in 2008.

Operating
Leases

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries also have available funding sources that are
provided through operating leases.  PPL Energy Supply's subsidiaries
lease office space, land, buildings and certain equipment.  These
leasing structures provide PPL Energy Supply with additional operating and
financing flexibility.  The operating leases contain covenants that
are typical for these agreements, such as maintaining insurance, maintaining
corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees.

PPL
Energy Supply, through its subsidiary PPL Montana, leases a 50% interest in
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3, under four 36-year,
non-cancelable operating leases.  These operating leases are not
recorded on PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets.  The leases place
certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell
assets and declare dividends.  At this time, PPL Energy Supply
believes that these restrictions will not limit access to these funding sources
or cause acceleration or termination of the leases.  See Note 8 to the
Financial Statements for a discussion of other dividend restrictions related to
PPL Global subsidiaries.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the operating
leases.

Long-Term
Debt Securities and Contributions from Member

Subject
to market conditions in 2008, PPL Energy Supply currently plans to issue up to
$600 million in long-term debt securities.  PPL Energy Supply expects
to use the proceeds primarily to fund capital expenditures, to fund redemptions
of its existing debt and a maturity of existing tax-exempt debt of PPL Electric,
and for general corporate purposes.

From time
to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Energy Supply's Member,
PPL Energy Funding, makes capital contributions to PPL Energy
Supply.  PPL Energy Supply uses these contributions for general
corporate purposes, including funding redemptions of existing debt.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, PPL Energy Supply currently expects to
incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual
obligations and distributions to its Member.

approximately $5.4 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised
periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  This table includes projected costs related to the
planned 331 MW incremental capacity increases.  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the installation cost
of sulfur dioxide scrubbers and other pollution control equipment, which
comprise most of the "Environmental" expenditures noted above.

PPL
Energy Supply plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2008 with cash on
hand, cash from operations, contributions from Member and the issuance of debt
securities.

Contractual

corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
preferred securities of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries.  Based
on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain
ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it
issues.  The credit ratings of PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries
are based on information provided by PPL Energy Supply and other
sources.  The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of PPL Energy Supply or its
subsidiaries.  Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal
by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other
and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  A
downgrade in PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could
result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital
markets.

Moody's
did not take any actions related to PPL Energy Supply and its rated subsidiaries
during 2007.  In March 2007, Fitch affirmed its BBB rating of PPL
Montana's 8.903% Pass Through Certificates due 2020.  In December
2007, S&P completed its annual review of PPL Energy Supply and affirmed its
credit ratings and stable outlook noted in the table above for PPL Energy
Supply.

Ratings
Triggers

PPL
Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are convertible upon
the occurrence of certain events, including if the long-term credit ratings
assigned to the notes by Moody's and S&P are lower than BB and Ba2, or
either Moody's or S&P no longer rates the notes.  The terms of the
notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the
notes.  See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for more information
concerning the Convertible Senior Notes.

WPD
(South West)'s 1.541% Index-linked Notes due 2053 and 2056 and WPD (South
Wales)'s 4.80436% Notes due 2037 may be put by the holders back to the issuer
for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes by Moody's,
S&P or Fitch are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies or reduced to a
non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring
event.  A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material
adverse change to, the distribution license under which WPD (South West) and WPD
(South Wales) operate.  These notes totaled $943 million at December
31, 2007.

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity
exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below "investment grade" that would
accelerate the due dates of borrowings.  However, if PPL Energy
Supply's debt ratings had been below investment grade at December 31, 2007, PPL
Energy Supply would have had to post an additional $132 million of collateral to
counterparties.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

PPL
Energy Supply provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing
arrangements that enable certain transactions.  Some of the guarantees
contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict
the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements,
require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated
affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  At this time,
PPL Energy Supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the
relevant funding sources.

PPL
Energy Supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the
scope of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34."  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of guarantees.

Risk
Management - Energy Marketing & Trading and Other

Market
Risk

Background

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of price
changes associated with a particular financial or commodity
instrument.  PPL Energy Supply is exposed to market risk
from:

PPL
Energy Supply has a risk management policy approved by PPL's Board of Directors
to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk.  Credit risk is
discussed below.  The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired
by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations and
other risk measurement metrics.

The
forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur
in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on
model assumptions.  Actual future results may differ materially from
those presented.  These disclosures are not precise indicators of
expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible
losses.

Contract
Valuation

PPL
Energy Supply utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and
structured deals, such as tolling agreements, as part of its risk management
strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility.

When available, quoted
market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial
instrument.  This may include exchange prices, quotes obtained from
brokers, or an independent valuation by an external source, such as a
bank.  However, market prices for energy or energy-related contracts
may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity.  If no
active trading market exists, contract valuations may include the use of
internally developed models, which are then reviewed by an independent, internal
group.  Although PPL Energy Supply believes its valuation methods are
reasonable, changes in underlying assumptions could result in significantly
different values and realization in future periods.

To record
energy derivatives at their fair value, PPL Energy Supply discounts the forward
values, as appropriate, using the U.S. Utility BBB
Curve.  Additionally, PPL Energy Supply adjusts derivative carrying
values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality, potential market
illiquidity for net open positions and the risk that modeled values may be
inaccurate, as follows:

Accounting
and Reporting

To
account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk, PPL
Energy Supply follows the provisions of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted (together, "SFAS
133"); EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities;" and EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on
Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held
for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3."  In accordance
with SFAS 133, all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet as an asset or liability (unless they meet SFAS 133's criteria for
exclusion), and changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized currently
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

In
accordance with EITF 02-3, PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and
unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for
trading purposes in the "Net energy trading margins" line on the Statements of
Income.

In
accordance with EITF 03-11, non-trading bilateral sales of electricity at major
market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those
same delivery points.  A major market delivery point is any delivery
point with liquid pricing available.

These
contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets" and "Price risk
management liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.  Short-term derivative
positions are included in "Current Assets" and "Current
Liabilities."  Long-term derivative positions are included in "Other
Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent
Liabilities."

Accounting
Designation

Energy
contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting
treatment.  For commodity contracts that meet the definition of a
derivative, the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy
transactions are entered into determine their accounting
designation.  In addition to commodity transactions, PPL Energy Supply
enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge
interest expense and foreign currency risk associated with both existing and
anticipated debt issuances.  PPL Energy Supply also enters into
foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments
denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign
operations.  As with commodity transactions, the circumstances and
intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract's accounting
designation.  These designations are verified by an independent
internal group on a daily basis.  See Note 18 to the Financial
Statements for a summary of the guidelines used for the designation of
derivative energy contracts.

Commodity
Price Risk (Non-trading)

Commodity
price risk is one of PPL Energy Supply's most significant risks due to the level
of investment that PPL Energy Supply maintains in its generation
assets.  Several factors influence price levels and
volatilities.  These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal
changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within
regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions,
market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and
state regulations.

To hedge
the impact of market price fluctuations on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related
assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL EnergyPlus sells and
purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs
throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and
over-the-counter contracts.  PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity
derivative contracts mature at various times through 2017.  PPL Energy
Supply segregates its non-trading activities into two
categories:  hedge activity and economic
activity.  Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity
qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133.  The majority
of PPL Energy Supply's energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge
accounting.  The economic activity category includes transactions that
address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which
hedge accounting was not elected.  Included in this category are
certain load-following energy obligations and related supply contracts, FTRs,
crude oil swaps to hedge rail transportation charges and hedges of synthetic
fuel tax credits.  Although they do not receive hedge accounting
treatment, these contracts are considered non-trading activity.  The
fair value of economic activity at December 31, 2007, including net premiums on
options, was $67 million.

Within
PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio, the decision to enter into energy
contracts is influenced by the expected value of PPL Energy Supply's
generation.  In determining the number of MWhs that are available to
be sold forward, PPL Energy Supply reduces the maximum potential output that a
plant may produce by three factors - planned maintenance, unplanned outages and
economic conditions.  The potential output of a plant is first reduced
by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a
particular unit.  Another reduction, representing the unplanned outage
rate, is the amount of MWhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to
such factors as equipment breakage.  Finally, the potential output of
certain plants (such as peaking units) is reduced because their higher cost of
production will not allow them to economically run during all
hours.

PPL
Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy
contracts that qualify for accrual accounting.  The net obligation to
serve these contracts changes minute by minute.  Anticipated usage
patterns and energy peaks are affected by expected load changes, regional
economic drivers and seasonality.  PPL Energy Supply analyzes
historical on-peak and off-peak usage patterns, expected load changes, regional
economic drivers, and weather patterns, among other factors, to determine a
monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in
order to minimize earnings volatility.  To satisfy its full
requirements obligations, PPL Energy Supply may enter into contracts to purchase
unbundled products of electricity, capacity, renewable energy credits and other
ancillary products.  Alternatively, PPL Energy Supply may reserve a
block amount of generation for full requirements contracts that is expected to
be the best match with anticipated usage patterns and energy
peaks.  The majority of purchases to supply full requirements sales
contracts receive hedge accounting treatment.

Besides
energy commodities, PPL Energy Supply implemented a program in 2006 to hedge its
exposures to changes in market prices of certain metals necessary for the
scrubbers PPL Energy Supply is installing at the Brunner Island and Montour
generating plants.  These contracts qualified for hedge accounting
treatment.

The
"Prices actively quoted" category includes the fair value of exchange-traded
options and futures contracts, which have quoted prices through
2013.

The
"Prices provided by other external sources" category includes PPL Energy
Supply's forward positions and options in natural gas and electricity and
natural gas basis swaps at points for which over-the-counter (OTC) broker quotes
are available.

The
"Prices based on models and other valuation methods" category includes the value
of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as
a result of the long-dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the
market point, or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or OTC
broker.  This category includes the fair value of transactions
completed in auction markets, where contract prices represent the market value
for load-following bundled energy prices delivered at illiquid delivery
points.

Because
of PPL Energy Supply's efforts to hedge the value of energy from its generation
assets, PPL Energy Supply sells electricity, capacity and related services and
buys fuel on a forward basis, resulting in open contractual
positions.  If PPL Energy Supply were unable to deliver firm capacity
and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain
circumstances it could be required to pay damages.  These damages
would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price
of the commodity.  Depending on price volatility in the wholesale
energy markets, such damages could be significant.  Extreme weather
conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions,
nonperformance by counterparties (or their own counterparties) with which it has
energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL Energy Supply's ability to
meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of
replacement energy.  Although PPL Energy Supply attempts to mitigate
these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its
firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to
perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the
future.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement in
market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
the value of the commodity contracts in its non-trading portfolio by
approximately $513 million, compared with a decrease of $303 million at
December 31, 2006.  For purposes of this calculation, an increase
in the market price for electricity is considered an adverse movement because
PPL Energy Supply's electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position,
and a decrease in the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement
because PPL Energy Supply's commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net
purchase position.  PPL Energy Supply enters into those commodity
contracts to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of
electricity.

Starting
in 2007, PPL Energy Supply elected to use an alternative method for disclosing
quantitative information about certain market risk sensitive
instruments.  This method utilizes a VaR model to measure commodity
price risk in its non-trading and trading portfolios.  This approach
is consistent with how PPL's Risk Manager assesses the market risk of its
commodity business.  VaR is a statistical model that attempts to
predict risk of loss, under normal market conditions, based on historical market
price volatility.  PPL Energy Supply calculates VaR using a Monte
Carlo simulation technique, which uses historical data from the past 12 month
period.  The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of earnings based on a
one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval.  At
December 31, 2007, the VaR for PPL Energy Supply's non-trading portfolio
was $12 million.

Commodity
Price Risk (Trading)

PPL
Energy Supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market
opportunities.  As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a
net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if
prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.  The
margins from these trading activities are shown in the Statements of Income as
"Net energy trading margins."

PPL
Energy Supply's trading contracts mature at various times through
2012.  The following chart sets forth the net fair market value of PPL

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement in
market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased
the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by $27 million,
compared with a decrease of $37 million at December 31, 2006.

At
December 31, 2007, the VaR for PPL Energy Supply's trading portfolio was $3
million.

Synthetic
Fuel Tax Credit Risk

PPL
Energy Supply expected the high level and the volatility of crude oil prices to
reduce the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits it would receive through
synthetic fuel production.  The tax credits are reduced if the annual
average wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase-out
range.  The tax credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds
the phase-out range.  See "Regulatory Issues - IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax
Credits" in Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding
the phase-out of the tax credits.

PPL
Energy Supply implemented a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of the
variability of cash flows associated with its 2006 and 2007 synthetic fuel tax
credits by hedging the risk that 2006 and 2007 annual average wellhead prices
for domestic crude oil will be within the phase-out range.

PPL
Energy Supply had net purchased options for 2007 to mitigate its tax credit
phase-out risk due to an increase of the average wellhead price in
2007.  These positions did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment.  The settlement value of these positions at
December 31, 2007, was a gain of $100 million.  The proceeds were
received in January 2008.

Commodity
Price Risk Summary

In
accordance with its marketing strategy, PPL Energy Supply does not completely
hedge its generation output or fuel requirements.  PPL Energy Supply
estimates that for its entire portfolio, including all generation, emissions and
physical and financial energy positions, a 10% adverse change in power prices
across all geographic zones and time periods would not have a material effect on
expected 2008 gross margins.  Similarly, a 10% adverse movement in all
fossil fuel prices would decrease expected 2008 gross margins by $20
million.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL
Energy Supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations,
which exposes them to interest rate risk.  Both PPL and PPL Energy
Supply manage the interest rate risk of PPL Energy Supply by using various
financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest
rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt portfolio, adjust the duration of its debt
portfolio and lock in treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries)
in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.  Risk limits
under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to
volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of PPL Energy
Supply's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest
rates.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply's potential annual exposure to increased
interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was $3 million,
compared with $4 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL
Energy Supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and
international debt portfolios.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy
Supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of
its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was $251
million, compared with $296 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce PPL
Energy Supply's exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its
debt instruments.  These risks include exposure to adverse interest
rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated
financing.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair
value of these instruments, any changes in the fair value of these instruments
are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
which the item being hedged affects earnings.  At December 31, 2007
and 2006, PPL Energy Supply had none of these instruments
outstanding.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust the
mix of fixed and floating interest rates in PPL Energy Supply's debt
portfolio.  While PPL Energy Supply is exposed to changes in the fair
value of these instruments, any change in market value is recorded with an equal
and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged.  At
December 31, 2007, the market value of these instruments, representing the
amount PPL Energy Supply would receive upon their termination, was
insignificant.  PPL Energy Supply estimated that its potential
exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments, through a 10%
adverse movement in interest rates, was $1 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

WPDH
Limited holds a net position in cross-currency swaps totaling $527 million to
hedge the interest payments and principal of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds
with maturity dates ranging from December 2008 to December 2028.  The
estimated value of this position at December 31, 2007, being the amount WPDH
Limited would pay to terminate it, including accrued interest, was $152
million.  At December 31, 2007, WPDH Limited estimated that its
potential additional exposure to a change in the market value of these
instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, was $122 million.  At December 31, 2006, the
potential additional exposure for the cross-currency swaps outstanding at that
time was $115 million for a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates.

Foreign
Currency Risk

PPL
Energy Supply is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments
in U.K. affiliates.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply's domestic
operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S.
dollars.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have adopted a foreign currency risk management program
designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm
commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net
investments.  In addition, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into
financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of
expected earnings.

In 2007,
PPL executed forward sale contracts totaling Â£98 million.  In
connection with these transactions, PPL Energy Supply entered into forward
contracts with PPL that have terms identical to those executed by
PPL.  These forward sale contracts are to protect the value of a
portion of PPL Energy Supply's net investment in WPD.  The settlement
dates of these contracts range from January 2008 through June
2011.  At December 31, 2007, the market value of these positions,
representing the amount PPL Energy Supply would receive from PPL and PPL would
receive from third parties upon their termination, was $3
million.  PPL Energy Supply estimated that the potential exposure to a
change in the market value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement
in foreign currency exchange rates, was $18 million at December 31,
2007.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds - Securities Price Risk

In
connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds
to fund certain costs of decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear
station.  As of December 31, 2007, these funds were invested
primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities
and are reflected at fair value on PPL Energy Supply's Balance
Sheet.  The mix of securities is designed to provide returns
sufficient to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for
inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.  However, the equity
securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity
markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to
changes in interest rates.  PPL actively monitors the investment
performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its
nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement.  At December 31,
2007, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity
prices would have resulted in an estimated $40 million reduction in the fair
value of the trust assets, compared with a $38 million reduction at December 31,
2006.  See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

Defined
Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional
information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan
assets.

Credit
Risk

Credit
risk relates to the risk of loss that PPL Energy Supply would incur as a result
of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual
obligations.  PPL Energy Supply maintains credit policies and
procedures with respect to counterparties (including requirements that
counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria) and requires other
assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances
in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  However, PPL Energy
Supply has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities,
natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading
companies.  These concentrations of counterparties may impact PPL
Energy Supply's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or
negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in
economic, regulatory or other conditions.  As discussed above in
"Contract Valuation," PPL Energy Supply records certain nonperformance reserves
to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of
the money (from the counterparty's standpoint) will default in its
performance.  In this case, PPL Energy Supply would have to sell into
a lower-priced market or purchase from a higher-priced market.  These
reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in "Price risk
management assets" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL Energy Supply also
records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make
payments for deliveries PPL Energy Supply has made but not yet
billed.  These reserves are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the
Balance Sheets.  PPL Energy Supply also has established a reserve with
respect to certain sales to the California ISO for which PPL Energy Supply has
not yet been paid, which is reflected in accounts receivable on the Balance
Sheets.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

Acquisitions,
Development and Divestitures

PPL
Energy Supply continuously evaluates strategic options for its business segments
and, from time to time, PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries are involved in
negotiations with third parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets, joint ventures and development projects, which may or may
not result in definitive agreements.  Any such transactions may impact
future financial results.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 to the Financial
Statements for information regarding such recent transactions.

PPL
Energy Supply is currently planning incremental capacity increases of 331 MW at
several existing domestic generating facilities.  Offsetting this
increase is an expected 30 MW reduction in net generation capability at each of
the Brunner Island and Montour plants, due to the estimated increases in station
service usage during the scrubber operation.  See Note 15 to the
Financial Statements for additional information, as well as information
regarding the shutdown of two 150 MW generating units at Martins Creek in
September 2007.

PPL

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL
Energy Supply's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by
the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are
particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of
PPL Energy Supply, and require estimates or other judgments of matters
inherently uncertain.  Changes in the estimates or other judgments
included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change
to the information presented in the Financial Statements.  (These
accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial
Statements.)  PPL's senior management has reviewed these critical
accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with its
Audit Committee.  In addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed
the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting
policies with the Audit Committee.

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements."  Among other
things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for
measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157
through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to
FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair
Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under
Statement 13" and  FSP FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 157."  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its scope,
certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 delays the effective date of
SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
annually).

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL Energy Supply will partially adopt SFAS 157, as
amended, effective January 1, 2008.  The January 1, 2008 adoption,
although not expected to be significant, is expected to affect the fair value
component of PPL Energy Supply's critical accounting policies related to "Price
Risk Management" and "Defined Benefits" in future periods.  As
permitted by this guidance, PPL Energy Supply will adopt SFAS 157, as amended,
effective January 1, 2009, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis.  The January 1, 2009 adoption could affect the
fair value component of PPL Energy Supply's critical accounting policies related
to "Asset Impairment" and "Asset Retirement Obligations."  See Note 23
to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding SFAS 157, as
amended.

Defined
Benefits

PPL
Energy Supply subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans and participate in, and are allocated a significant portion
of the liability and net periodic defined benefit costs of plans sponsored by
PPL Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply follow the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these defined benefits.  In
addition, PPL and PPL Energy Supply adopted the recognition and measurement date
provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31, 2006.  Subsequent
to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL and PPL Energy Supply are required to record an
asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans
with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income
(OCI).  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans
is now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL and PPL Energy Supply no
longer recognize additional minimum liability adjustments in OCI.  See
Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the
plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any difference between actual and estimated
results is recorded in OCI.  These amounts in accumulated OCI are
amortized to income over future periods.  This delayed recognition in
income of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the
working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The
primary assumptions are:

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL Energy
Supply starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 500 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$350 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply increased
the discount rate for its domestic pension plans from 5.94% to 6.39% as a result
of this assessment and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement
benefit plans from 5.79% to 6.13%.

A similar
process is used to select the discount rate for the WPD pension plans, which
uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its
base.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply increased the discount
rate for its international pension plans from 5.17% to 6.37% as a result of this
assessment.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL Energy Supply considers tax
implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of
investments held by the plans.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy
Supply's expected return on plan assets was decreased from 8.27% to 8.04% for
its domestic pension plans.  For its international plans, PPL Energy
Supply's expected return on plan assets was reduced from 8.09% to 7.90% at
December 31, 2007.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL Energy Supply considers past
experience in light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31,
2007, PPL Energy Supply's rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for
its domestic plans.  For its international plans, PPL Energy Supply's
rate of compensation increase was increased from 4.0% to 4.25% at December 31,
2007.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL Energy Supply considers past
performance and forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31,
2007, PPL Energy Supply's health care cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2008,
gradually declining to 5.5% for 2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and OCI.  While the charts below reflect either
an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change would
impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net
periodic defined benefit costs and OCI by a similar amount in the opposite
direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the
change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include income
tax effects.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply was allocated and recognized net periodic defined benefit
costs charged to operating expenses of $62 million.  This amount
represents a $15 million increase from 2006.  This increase in expense
was primarily attributable to PPL Energy Supply's international plans, and
increased amortization from accumulated OCI of prior losses.

Asset
Impairment

PPL
Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for long-lived assets, including
intangibles, which are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance
with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets."  PPL Energy Supply tests for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying value may
not be recoverable.  Examples of such events or changes in
circumstances are:

For a
long-lived asset, an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum
of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset.  If the asset is impaired, an
impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying value to its
estimated fair value.

In
determining asset impairments, management must make significant judgments to
estimate future cash flows, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair
value of the assets and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those
identified and recorded in the financial statements.  For determining
fair value, the FASB has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets
are the best evidence of fair value.  However, when market prices are
unavailable, other valuation techniques may be used.  PPL Energy
Supply has generally used discounted cash flow to estimate fair
value.  Discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash
flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present
value of the cash flow streams.

PPL
Energy Supply has determined that, when considering alternative courses of
action to recover the carrying value of a long-lived asset, it uses estimated
cash flows from the "most likely" approach to assess impairment whenever one
scenario is clearly the most likely outcome.  If no scenario is
clearly most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into
consideration estimated cash flows from the alternative
scenarios.  For assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet
date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the
likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date,
including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the
assets.  That assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not
revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply recorded impairments of certain long-lived
assets.  See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
the impairment of PPL Energy Supply's domestic telecommunication assets, Note 10
to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the impairment of certain Latin
American businesses and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
the impairment of certain transmission rights.

PPL
Energy Supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with SFAS
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."  SFAS 142 requires
goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.  PPL
Energy Supply has determined its reporting units to be at or one level below its
operating segments.  PPL Energy Supply performs an annual impairment
test for goodwill, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be greater than the
unit's fair value.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  The first step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired.  If the carrying value
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The
second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of
goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  That
is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was
the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  The excess of the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied
fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying
value of that goodwill.  If the carrying value exceeds the implied
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the
reporting unit's goodwill.

In 2007,
no second-step assessments were required for goodwill in any reporting
units.  PPL Energy Supply's most significant assumptions surrounding
the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair
values.  PPL Energy Supply estimated fair values primarily based upon
discounted cash flows.  For the U.K. reporting unit, an increase of
the discount rate by 25 basis points or a 10% reduction in cash flows would have
resulted in the failure of the first-step assessment and required the
performance of the second-step assessment.  The second-step assessment
would have required a purchase price allocation based on the guidance from SFAS
141, "Business Combinations."  It would have taken a significant
change in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of WPD to result in an
impairment of goodwill in the second-step assessment.  A decrease in
the forecasted cash flows of 10% or an increase of the discount rates by 25
basis points for the other goodwill tests would not have resulted in an
impairment of goodwill in other reporting units.

PPL
Energy Supply also performs a review of the residual value of leased assets in
accordance with SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases."  PPL Energy Supply
tests the residual value of these assets annually or more frequently whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that a leased asset's residual value
may have declined.  The residual value is defined by SFAS 13 as the
estimated fair value of the leased property at the end of the lease
term.  If the review produces a lower estimate of residual value than
was originally recorded, PPL Energy Supply is required to determine whether the
decline is other than temporary.  If it is other than temporary, the
residual value will be revised using the new estimate.  This reduction
in the residual value will be recognized as a loss in the period in which the
estimate was changed.  If the review provides a higher estimate of
residual value than was originally recorded, no adjustment will be
made.

In
testing the residual value of leased assets, management must make significant
assumptions to estimate:  future cash flows; the useful lives of the
leased assets; fair value of the assets; and management's intent to use the
assets.  Changes in assumptions used in the tests could result in
significantly different outcomes from those identified and recorded in the
financial statements.  PPL Energy Supply uses discounted cash flow to
determine the estimated fair value of the leased assets at the end of the lease
term.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries evaluated the residual value of certain
leased assets.  This analysis did not indicate any necessary changes
to the residual value.  PPL Energy Supply's estimate was based on
using projections of electric and fuel prices and any firm sale and purchase
agreements.  An increase of the discount rate by 25 basis points or a
10% reduction in the forecasted cash flows would not have resulted in a
reduction of the residual value of these leased assets.

Leasing

PPL
Energy Supply applies the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," to all
leasing transactions.  In addition, PPL Energy Supply applies the
provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and
the EITF that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to
accounting for various leasing arrangements.  In general, there are
two types of leases from a lessee's perspective: operating leases (leases
accounted for off-balance sheet); and capital leases (leases capitalized on the
balance sheet).

In
accounting for leases, management makes various assumptions, including the
discount rate, the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated
useful life, in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or
capital. Changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between
whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease, thus
significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial
statements.

In
addition to uncertainty inherent in management's assumptions, leasing
transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when
they involve: real estate and/or related integral equipment; sale/leaseback
accounting (leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased
assets); synthetic leases (leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for
book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes);
and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply continued to participate in a significant
sale/leaseback transaction.  In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its
interest in the Colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the
assets back to PPL Montana under four 36-year leases.  This
transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current
accounting pronouncements related to sale/leaseback arrangements.  If
for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off-balance
sheet operating lease treatment as a sale/leaseback, PPL Energy Supply would
have recorded approximately $231 million of additional assets and approximately
$292 million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at December 31,
2007, and would have recorded additional expenses estimated at $6 million,
after-tax, in 2007.

See Note
11 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to operating
leases.

5)

Loss
Accruals

PPL
Energy Supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain
outcomes.  PPL Energy Supply's accounting for such events is
prescribed by SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and other related
accounting guidance.  SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing
condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to
possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one
or more future events occur or fail to occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  SFAS 5 does not permit the
accrual of contingencies that might result in gains.  PPL Energy
Supply continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental
remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other
events.

PPL
Energy Supply also has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase
commitments when significant events have occurred.  For example,
estimated losses were accrued when long-term purchase commitments were assumed
under asset acquisition agreements and when PPL Electric's generation business
was deregulated.  Under regulatory accounting, PPL Electric recorded
the above-market cost of energy purchases from NUGs as part of its purchased
power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs were recovered in
regulated rates.  When the generation business was deregulated, the
estimated loss associated with these long-term purchase commitments to make
above-market NUG purchases was recorded because PPL Electric was committed to
purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these
costs in regulated rates.  As described below, this loss accrual was
transferred to PPL EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000 corporate
realignment.  PPL Energy Supply considers these losses to be similar
to asset impairments or inventory write-downs.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include:  (1) the
initial identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of
triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing
assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All
three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant
judgment by PPL Energy Supply's management.

Initial Identification and
Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
Energy Supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers
and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has
been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Significant
loss accruals were initially recorded in 2005 and 2006.  One involved
the accrual of remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the
Martins Creek generating station.  Another was the loss accrual
related to the PJM billing dispute.  Significant judgment was required
by PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's management to perform the initial assessment of
these contingencies.

Â·

In
      August 2005, there was a leak of water containing fly ash from a disposal
      basin at the Martins Creek plant.  This resulted in ash being
      deposited onto adjacent roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and
      the Delaware River.  PPL Energy Supply immediately began to work
      with the Pennsylvania DEP and appropriate agencies and consultants to
      assess the extent of environmental damage caused by the discharge and to
      remediate the damage.  At that time, PPL Energy Supply had, and
      still has, no reason to believe that the Martins Creek fly ash leak has
      caused any danger to human health or any adverse biological impact on the
      river aquatic life.  However, at that time, PPL Energy Supply
      expected that it would be subject to an enforcement action by the
      Pennsylvania DEP and that claims may be brought against it by several
      state agencies and private litigants.

PPL
      Energy Supply's management assessed the contingency in the third quarter
      of 2005.  The ultimate cost of the remediation effort was
      difficult to estimate due to a number of uncertainties, such as the scope
      of the project, the impact of weather conditions on the ash recovery
      effort, and the ultimate outcome of enforcement actions and private
      litigation.  PPL Energy Supply's management concluded, at the
      time, that $33 million was the best estimate of the cost of the
      remediation effort.  PPL Energy Supply recorded this loss
      accrual in the third quarter of 2005.  See "Ongoing Assessment
      of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a discussion of the year-end assessments of
      this contingency.

Â·

In
      2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy, Inc.
      (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC,
      alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as
      a result of an error by PJM.  The complaint requested the FERC,
      among other things, to direct PPL Electric to refund to PJM $39 million,
      plus interest of $8 million, and for PJM to refund these same amounts to
      PECO.  In April 2005, the FERC issued an Order Establishing
      Hearing and Settlement Judge Proceedings (the Order).  In the
      Order, the FERC determined that PECO was entitled to reimbursement for the
      transmission congestion charges that PECO asserted PJM erroneously
      billed.  The FERC ordered settlement discussions, before a
      judge, to determine the amount of the overcharge to PECO and the parties
      responsible for reimbursement to PECO.

Based
      on an evaluation of the FERC Order, PPL's management concluded that it was
      probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the PJM billing
      dispute.  PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual of $47 million,
      the amount of PECO's claim, in the first quarter of 2005.

In
      December 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC, pursuant to a
      November 2006 order, a modified offer of settlement (Compliance
      Filing).  Under the Compliance Filing, PPL Electric would make a
      single payment through its monthly PJM bill of $38 million, plus interest
      through the date of payment, and PJM would include a single credit for
      this amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill.  Through December 31,
      2006, the estimated interest on this payment was $4 million, for a total
      payment of $42 million.  Based on the Compliance Filing, PPL
      Electric reduced the recorded loss accrual by $5 million at December 31,
      2006.  PPL determined that PPL EnergyPlus was responsible for
      the claims subsequent to July 1, 2000 (totaling $30 million), and that PPL
      Electric was responsible for claims prior to that date (totaling $12
      million).  Accordingly, PPL EnergyPlus recorded a loss accrual
      of $30 million at December 31, 2006, for its share of the claims and a
      corresponding payable to PPL Electric.  PPL EnergyPlus recorded
      $27 million of "Energy purchases" and $3 million of "Interest Expense" on
      the Statement of Income.

In
      March 2007, the FERC entered an order approving the Compliance
      Filing.  In April 2007, PPL Electric paid PJM the full
      settlement amount of $43 million, including additional interest of $1
      million recorded during the three months ended March 31,
      2007.  PPL Energy Supply paid PPL Electric for its portion of
      the settlement.  This proceeding is now terminated and no
      contingency exists at December 31,
2007.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on both of these
contingencies and see "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" below for a
discussion of the year-end assessment of the ash basin leak
contingency.

There
were no significant loss accruals initially recorded in 2007.

PPL
Energy Supply has identified certain other events that could give rise to a
loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS
5.  SFAS 5 requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential
losses when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been
incurred.  The FASB defines "reasonably possible" as cases in which
"the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less
than likely."  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure
of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual
under SFAS 5.

Reducing Recorded Loss
Accruals

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL Energy Supply identifies, where applicable, the
triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The
triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the
actual loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

The
largest loss accrual on PPL Energy Supply's balance sheet, and the loss accrual
that changed most significantly in 2007, was for an impairment of above-market
NUG purchase commitments.  This loss accrual reflects the estimated
difference between the above-market contract terms, under the purchase
commitments, and the expected fair value of the electricity to be purchased at
the date these contracts were impaired.  This loss accrual was
originally recorded at $879 million in 1998, when PPL Electric's generation
business was deregulated.

When the
loss accrual related to NUG purchases was recorded in 1998, PPL Electric
established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be
reduced.  A schedule was established to reduce the liability based on
projected purchases over the lives of the NUG contracts.  This loss
accrual was transferred to PPL EnergyPlus in the July 1, 2000 corporate
realignment.  PPL EnergyPlus continues to reduce the above-market NUG
liability based on the aforementioned schedule.  As PPL EnergyPlus
reduces the liability for the above-market NUG purchases, it offsets the actual
cost of NUG purchases, thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in
line with expected market prices.  The above-market loss accrual was
$71 million at December 31, 2007.  This loss accrual will be
significantly reduced by 2009, when all but one of the NUG contracts
expires.  The then-remaining NUG contract will expire in
2014.

Ongoing Assessment of
Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
Energy Supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient.  This involves
ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel,
engineers, operation management and other parties.

As part
of the year-end preparation of its financial statements, PPL Energy Supply's
management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the ash basin leak at Martins
Creek recorded in 2005, described above under "Initial Identification and
Recording of the Loss Accrual.  Based on the ongoing remediation
efforts and communications with the Pennsylvania DEP and other appropriate
agencies, at December 31, 2005, PPL Energy Supply's management concluded that
$48 million was the best estimate of the cost of the remediation
effort.

In 2006,
PPL Energy Supply reduced the estimate of costs to $37 million, primarily due to
an insurance claim settlement.  At December 31, 2007, management's
best estimate of the probable loss associated with the Martins Creek ash basin
leak remains at $37 million.  Based on actual costs incurred and
recorded to date, at December 31, 2007, the remaining contingency for this
remediation was $9 million.  PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the
final cost of the remediation, the outcome of the action initiated by the
Pennsylvania DEP, the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, the
outcome of the lawsuit brought by the citizens and businesses and the exact
nature of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated
against PPL Energy Supply as a result of the disposal basin leak.  PPL
Energy Supply also cannot predict with certainty the extent of the fines or
damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions or the ultimate
financial impact on PPL Energy Supply.  PPL Energy Supply's management
will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in future
periods.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

SFAS 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as a
liability in the financial statements.  The initial obligation should
be measured at the estimated fair value.  An equivalent amount should
be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated
to expense over the useful life of the asset.  Until the obligation is
settled, the liability should be increased, through the recognition of accretion
expense in the income statement, for changes in the obligation due to the
passage of time.

FIN 47,
"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 143," clarifies the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS
143.  FIN 47 specifies that a conditional ARO must be recognized when
incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.

In
determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to
calculate fair value.  Fair value is developed through consideration
of estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the
anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was
incurred.  Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the
calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different
results than those identified and recorded in the financial
statements.  Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect
the carrying value of various AROs and the related assets, are reviewed
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the
latest estimate of the obligations.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply had AROs totaling $376 million recorded on
the Balance Sheet.  Of this amount, $298 million or 79% relates to PPL
Energy Supply's nuclear decommissioning ARO.  PPL Energy Supply's most
significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs,
the discount rates and the inflation rates.  A variance in the
forecasted retirement costs, the discount rates or the inflation rates could
have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities.

The
following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the nuclear
decommissioning ARO liability at PPL Energy Supply as of December 31, 2007,
associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial
recognition.  There is no significant change to the annual
depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO
liability as a result of changing the assumptions.  Each sensitivity
below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that
assumption.

Income
Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL Energy Supply's provision for
income taxes.  This is primarily due to uncertainty in various tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the determination of
deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances and estimating the
phase-out range for synthetic fuel tax credits that is not published by the IRS
until April of the following year.

Prior to
January 1, 2007, and in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
PPL Energy Supply evaluated uncertain tax positions and accrued charges for
probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount of benefit
that should be recognized in the financial statements.  This
assessment resulted in management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax
position for each tax year.  In addition, management considered the
reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and reevaluating the
need for valuation allowances.

In June
2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."  In May 2007, the FASB
amended this guidance by issuing FSP FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No. 48."  PPL Energy Supply and its subsidiaries
adopted FIN 48, as amended, effective January 1, 2007.  The adoption
of FIN 48 alters the methodology PPL Energy Supply previously used to account
for income tax uncertainties.  Effective with the adoption of FIN 48,
uncertain tax positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in
accordance with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 continues to require significant management judgment in
determining the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain
tax position.  FIN 48 requires PPL Energy Supply to evaluate its tax
positions following a two-step process.  The first step requires an
entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a
particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50 percent
chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination
assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is
aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The
second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the
benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
criterion.  The measurement of the benefit equals the largest amount
of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds
50 percent.  PPL Energy Supply 's management considers a number
of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a
settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL Energy Supply reassesses its uncertain tax positions by
considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on
management's assessment of new information, PPL Energy Supply may subsequently
recognize a tax benefit for a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize
a previously recognized tax position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously
recognized tax position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution
of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts
accrued and may materially impact PPL Energy Supply's financial statements in
the future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by paying cash, within one year of the reporting
date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated
each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of
a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in
assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of
temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this
assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

15 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding synthetic
fuel tax credits.

PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES CORPORATION

ITEM
7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

PPL
Electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  Its headquarters are in Allentown, PA.  See
"Item 1. Business - Background," for a description of PPL Electric's
business.  PPL Electric's strategy and principal challenge is to own
and operate its electricity delivery business while maintaining high quality
customer service and reliability in a cost-effective manner.

PPL
Electric's electricity delivery business is
rate-regulated.  Accordingly, this business is subject to regulatory
risk with respect to costs that may be recovered and investment returns that may
be collected through customer rates.  In particular, uncertainty
driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of PPL Electric's PLR
obligation after 2009, when its full requirements supply contracts with PPL
EnergyPlus expire, presents a risk for the electricity delivery
business.  The Customer Choice Act requires electricity delivery
companies, like PPL Electric, to act as a PLR of electricity and provides that
electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to
regulations to be established by the PUC.  As discussed in more detail
in "Results of Operations - Earnings - 2008 Outlook," there are a number of
ongoing regulatory and legislative activities that may affect PPL Electric's
recovery of supply costs after 2009.  In May 2007, the PUC approved
PPL Electric's plan to procure default electricity supply in 2007-2009 for
retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in
2010.  Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric has contracted for
one-third of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential,
small commercial and small industrial customers.  In November 2007,
PPL Electric filed a plan with the PUC, which is still pending, under which its
residential and small commercial customers, beginning in mid-2008, could begin
to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price increases when generation rate
caps expire in 2010.  In September 2007, the PUC regulations regarding
the obligation of Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity
supply in 2011 and beyond became effective.  Later this year, PPL
Electric plans to file for PUC approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan
under these regulations.  In addition to this regulatory activity, the
Governor of Pennsylvania has proposed an Energy Independence Strategy which,
among other things, contains initiatives to address PLR issues including a
requirement that PLRs will obtain a "least-cost portfolio" of electric
supply.  The Pennsylvania legislature has convened and continues a
special session to address the proposals in the Governor's Strategy and other
energy issues.  In addition, certain Pennsylvania legislators have
introduced legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost
recovery through rates for Pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their
transition periods, which in PPL Electric's case is December 31,
2009.  PPL Electric has expressed strong concern regarding the severe
potential consequences of such legislation on customer service, system
reliability, adequate future generation supply and PPL Electric's financial
viability.

In order
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, a key objective for PPL
Electric is to maintain a strong credit profile.  PPL Electric
continually focuses on maintaining an appropriate capital structure and
liquidity position.

See "Item
1A. Risk Factors" for more information concerning material risks PPL Electric
faces in its business.

The
purpose of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" is to provide information concerning PPL Electric's past
and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and managing the
risks and challenges mentioned above.  Specifically:

Factors," the rest of this Item 7 and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a
discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact PPL
Electric's future earnings.

Outlook

Excluding
special items, PPL Electric projects higher earnings, driven by higher revenues
as a result of PPL Electric's new distribution rates effective January 1,
2008.

In March
2007, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase distribution rates
by approximately $84 million (subsequently amended to $77
million).  In August 2007, PPL Electric entered into a settlement
agreement with the parties to increase its distribution rates by $55 million,
effective January 1, 2008, for an overall revenue increase of 1.7% over PPL
Electric's 2007 rates.  In December 2007, the PUC approved this
settlement without modification.

In May
2007, the PUC approved PPL Electric's plan to procure default electricity supply
in 2007-2009 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive
supplier in 2010 after PPL Electric's PLR contract with PPL EnergyPlus
expires.  Under the plan, PPL Electric was approved to issue a series
of competitive bids for such supply in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In July
2007, the PUC approved bids for the first of six competitive solicitations and
PPL Electric entered into supply contracts for 850 MW, or one-sixth of its
expected electricity supply needs in 2010 for residential, small commercial and
small industrial customers who do not choose a competitive
supplier.  The average generation supply prices from the first bid
process were $101.77 per MWh for residential customers and $105.11 per MWh for
small commercial and small industrial customers.  In October 2007, the
PUC approved bids for the second competitive solicitation and PPL Electric
entered into contracts for another 850 MW of 2010 generation supply for these
customers.  The average generation supply prices from the second bid
process were $105.08 per MWh for residential customers and $105.75 per MWh for
small commercial and small industrial customers.  As a result, PPL
Electric has contracted for one-third of the electricity supply it expects to
need for 2010.  If the average prices paid for the supply purchased so
far were to be the same for the remaining four purchases, the average
residential customer's monthly bill in 2010 would increase about 34.5% over 2009
levels, while small commercial and small industrial bills would increase in the
range of 22.8% to 42.2%.  The estimated increases include Pennsylvania
gross receipts tax and an adjustment for line losses, and exclude PPL Electric's
January 1, 2008 rate increase.  Actual 2010 prices will not be known
until all six supply purchases have been made.  The third solicitation
will be conducted in March 2008.

In May
2007, the PUC approved final regulations regarding the obligation of
Pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011
and beyond.  The new regulations provide that default service
providers will acquire electricity supply at prevailing market prices pursuant
to procurement and implementation plans approved by the PUC.  The
regulations also address the utilities' recovery of market supply
costs.  The final regulations became effective in September
2007.

In
addition, the Governor of Pennsylvania proposed an Energy Independence Strategy
(Strategy) in early 2007 which, among other things, contains initiatives to
address PLR issues.  For example, under the Strategy, retail customers
could elect to phase-in over three years any initial generation rate increase
approved by the PUC.  Also, PLR providers would be required to obtain
a "least cost portfolio" of supply by purchasing power in the spot market and
through contracts of varying lengths, and the provider would be required to
procure energy conservation resources before acquiring additional
power.  In addition, PLR providers could enter into long-term
contracts with large energy users and alternative energy
developers.  It is uncertain at this time whether the details of
implementing the Strategy, including the issues of deferral of costs and
recovery of interest for the customer rate phase-in program and the timing of
PUC approval for PLR supply portfolios, will be delegated to the
PUC.

Components
of the Strategy are included in various bills.  One such bill that
passed in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (House) in February 2008,
contains conservation and demand-side management targets and mandatory
deployment of smart metering technology.  The bill provides for full
and current cost recovery through an energy efficiency and demand-side
management recovery mechanism.

In
September 2007, the Pennsylvania General Assembly convened a special session to
address the proposals in the Governor's Strategy.  Central to the
Governor's Strategy is an $850 million Energy Independence Fund to support
alternative and renewable energy sources and energy conservation that would be
funded through revenue bonds and a surcharge on electricity
bills.  The Pennsylvania Senate (Senate) has formed a special
committee to manage legislation for the special legislative
session.  As an alternative to the Governor's $850 million Energy
Independence Fund, the full Senate has approved a bill that would create a $650
million fund for clean energy projects, conservation and energy efficiency
initiatives and pollution control projects that would be funded through revenue
bonds and gross receipts tax revenue, which will increase as rate caps
expire.  The House is also considering similar legislation to create
an $850 million dollar fund, also to be funded through revenue bonds and gross
receipts tax revenue.

PPL
Electric currently is working with Pennsylvania legislators, regulators and
other stakeholders to develop constructive measures to help customers transition
to market rates after 2009, including a variety of rate mitigation, educational
and energy conservation programs, consistent with several initiatives being
developed by the state administration and legislature.  In this
regard, in November 2007, PPL Electric requested the PUC to approve a plan under
which its residential and small commercial customers could smooth the impact of
price increases when generation rate caps expire in 2010.  The
proposed phase-in plan would provide customers the option of paying additional
amounts on their electric bills beginning in mid-2008 and continuing through
2009.  Funds collected during 2008 and 2009, plus accrued interest,
would be applied to 2010 and 2011 electric bills, mitigating the impact of the
rate cap expiration.  PPL Electric requested expedited consideration
by the PUC.  Ten parties have filed responses to PPL Electric's
petition, primarily because PPL Electric's proposal would offer the program on
an "opt-out" basis (i.e., customers would be enrolled automatically and
affirmatively have to "opt-out" if they choose not to participate).

The
parties have reached a settlement of this proceeding under which PPL Electric
has agreed to change the "opt-out" approach to an "opt-in" approach (i.e.,
customers would have to affirmatively enroll).  In addition, PPL
Electric has agreed to make the program available to customers enrolled in
budget billing.  On February 27, 2008, the settlement agreement was
filed with the Administrative Law Judge assigned to this case.  The
settlement must be approved by the Administrative Law Judge and the
PUC.

Certain
Pennsylvania legislators have introduced or are contemplating the introduction
of legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery
through rates for Pennsylvania utilities beyond their transition periods, which
in PPL Electric's case would be December 31, 2009.  PPL Electric has
expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential consequences of such
legislation on customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation
supply and PPL Electric's financial viability.  If such legislation or
similar legislation is enacted, PPL Electric could experience operating losses,
cash flow shortfalls and other adverse financial impacts.  In
addition, continuing uncertainty regarding PPL Electric's ability to recover its
market supply and other costs of operation after 2009 could adversely impact its
credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary
to operate its business.  In addition, PPL Electric believes that such
an extension of rate caps, if enacted into law, would violate federal law and
the U.S. Constitution.  At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the
final outcome or impact of this legislative and regulatory process.

Statement
of Income Analysis --

Operating
Revenues

Retail
Electric

The
increases in revenues from retail electric operations were attributable
to:

      electric delivery

$


$


Electric
      delivery


(38

$


$


Higher
PLR revenues and electric delivery revenues were primarily due to a 4% increase
in sales volume.  This increase was primarily due to the impact of
favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial sales and normal load
growth.

The
increases in revenues from retail electric operations for 2006 compared with
2005 were primarily due to increased PLR revenues resulting from an 8.4% rate
increase, offset by a decrease in electric delivery revenues resulting from a
decrease in sales volumes due in part to milder weather in 2006.

Wholesale Electric to
Affiliate

PPL
Electric has a contract to sell to PPL EnergyPlus the electricity that PPL
Electric purchases under contracts with NUGs.  The $9 million increase
in wholesale revenue to affiliate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due
to an unplanned outage at a NUG facility in 2005.  PPL Electric
therefore had more electricity to sell to PPL EnergyPlus in 2006.

Energy
Purchases

Energy
purchases increased by $31 million for 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to
the $28 million reduction in 2006 of the loss accrual recorded in 2005, for the
PJM billing dispute.  See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the PJM billing dispute.  Also, $6
million in higher ancillary costs contributed to the increase.

Energy
purchases decreased by $81 million for 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to
the $39 million loss accrual for the PJM billing dispute recorded in 2005 and
the $28 million reduction of that accrual recorded in 2006.  Also, the
decrease reflects $14 million in lower ancillary costs and a reduction of $8
million resulting from the elimination of a charge to load-serving entities,
which minimized the impacts of integrating into the Midwest ISO and PJM
markets.  These decreases were partially offset by a $7 million
increase due to an unplanned NUG outage in 2005.

Energy
Purchases from Affiliate

Energy
purchases from affiliate increased by $102 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  The increase reflects higher PLR load, as well as higher prices
for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus that
were needed to support the PLR load.

Energy
purchases from affiliate increased by $118 million in 2006 compared with
2005.  The increase is primarily the result of an 8.4% increase in
prices for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus
needed to support PLR load, offset by a slight decrease in that
load.

were also impacted by the purchase in 2006 of equipment previously
leased.  See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

Taxes,
Other Than Income

Taxes,
other than income increased by $11 million in 2007 compared with
2006.  The increase was primarily due to a $12 million increase in
domestic gross receipts tax expense, which is passed through to customers,
resulting from a 4% increase in sales volume.

Taxes,
other than income increased by $4 million in 2006 compared with
2005.  The increase was primarily due to a $7 million increase in
gross receipts tax expense, partially offset by a $2 million decrease in real
estate tax expense.

Financial
Condition

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

PPL
Electric is focused on maintaining its investment grade credit profile by
maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and a strong balance
sheet.  PPL Electric believes that its cash on hand, operating cash
flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken
as a whole, provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating
requirements, future security maturities and estimated future capital
expenditures.  PPL Electric currently expects cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments at the end of 2008 to be less than $100 million,
while maintaining $200 million in credit facility capacity.  However,
PPL Electric's cash flows from operations and access to cost effective bank and
capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not
limited to:

Operating
Activities

PPL
Electric's cash provided by operating activities remained stable from 2005
through 2007.  Except for the items explained below, there were no
other significant changes in the components of PPL Electric's cash provided by
operating activities.  In 2007, delivery revenues increased primarily
as a result of an increase in sales volumes in 2007 compared with 2006, which
was due to the impact of favorable weather in 2007 on residential and commercial
sales and normal load growth.  This increase in revenues was offset by
an increase in energy purchases, primarily from PPL EnergyPlus under the PLR
contracts to support the PLR load.  In 2006, domestic retail electric
revenues increased as a result of an 8.4% increase in PLR sales prices in 2006,
but were partially offset by a decrease in domestic delivery revenues resulting
from a decrease in sales volumes in 2006 compared with 2005, due in part to
milder weather in 2006.  The net increase from revenues in 2006 was
offset by energy purchases PPL Electric made from PPL EnergyPlus under the PLR
contracts.  PPL Electric purchased less energy under the PLR contracts
in 2006 compared with 2005 but incurred a scheduled 8.4% increase in the price
it pays under such contracts.

An
important element supporting the stability of PPL Electric's cash from
operations is its purchase contracts with PPL EnergyPlus.  These
contracts provide sufficient energy for PPL Electric to meet its PLR obligation
through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge its
customers over this period.  These contracts require cash collateral
or other credit enhancement, or reductions or terminations of a portion of the
entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of adverse changes in
market prices.  Also under the contracts, PPL Energy Supply may
request cash collateral or other credit enhancement, or reductions or
terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the
event of a downgrade of PPL Electric's credit ratings.  The maximum
amount that PPL Electric would have to post under these contracts is $300
million, and PPL Electric estimates that it would not have had to post any
collateral if energy prices decreased by 10% from year-end 2007 or 2006
levels.

Investing
Activities

The
primary use of cash in investing activities is capital
expenditures.  See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding
capital expenditures in 2007 and projected expenditures for the years 2008
through 2012.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased by $48 million in 2007 compared with
2006, primarily as a result of $25 million in net proceeds from purchases and
sales of short-term investments and $23 million received from an affiliate as a
partial repayment on a demand loan that was extended to the affiliate in
2004.  Net cash used in investing activities increased by $94 million
in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily as a result of an increase of $115 million
in capital expenditures, of which $52 million related to the purchase of leased
equipment.  See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of the 2006 purchase of leased equipment in connection with the
termination of the related master lease agreements.

Financing
Activities

Although
net cash used in financing activities remained stable in 2007 compared with
2006, there were significant changes in certain components.  PPL
Electric had net debt retirements of $306 million in 2007 compared with $433
million in 2006.  Additionally, in 2006, PPL Electric received net
proceeds of $245 million from the issuance of preference stock, received a $75
million contribution from PPL and repurchased $200 million of common stock from
PPL.  A portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the
preference stock was used to fund the repurchase of common stock from PPL in
2006.  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for information
regarding the preference stock issued by PPL Electric.

Net cash
used in financing activities increased $199 million in 2006 compared with 2005,
primarily as a result of the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from
PPL, an increase of $298 million in net debt retirements and an increase of $23
million in dividends paid to PPL, partially offset by net proceeds of $245
million from the issuance of preference stock and a $75 million contribution
from PPL.

See
"Forecasted Sources of Cash" for a discussion of PPL Electric's plans to issue
debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity
available to PPL Electric.  Also see "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for a
discussion of PPL Electric's plans to pay dividends on its common and preferred
securities, as well as maturities of PPL Electric's long-term debt.

Forecasted Sources of
Cash

PPL
Electric expects to continue to have significant sources of cash available in
the near term, including a credit facility, a commercial paper program and an
asset-backed commercial paper program.  PPL Electric also expects to
continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets, as necessary, for
its long-term financing needs.

Credit
Facility

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Electric's total committed borrowing capacity under its
credit facility and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

      Electric Credit Facility (a)

$


$


(a)

Borrowings
      under PPL Electric's credit facility generally bear interest at
      LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, depending upon the company's public debt
      rating.  PPL Electric also has the capability to cause the
      lenders to issue up to $200 million of letters of credit under this
      facility, which issuances reduce available borrowing
      capacity.  Under certain conditions, PPL Electric may request
      that the facility's capacity be increased by up to $100
      million.

The
      credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring debt to total
      capitalization to not exceed 70%.  At December 31, 2007 and
      2006, PPL Electric's consolidated debt to total capitalization
      percentages, as calculated in accordance with its credit facility, were
      47% and 48%.  The credit facility also contains standard
      representations and warranties that must be made for PPL Electric to
      borrow under it.

(b)

PPL
      Electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of
      credit are drawn upon.

In
addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit
agreement contains various other covenants.  Failure to comply with
the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of
repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreement.  PPL
Electric monitors compliance with the covenants on a regular
basis.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Electric was in material
compliance with these covenants.  At this time, PPL Electric believes
that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to
this funding source.  PPL Electric intends to renew and extend its
$200 million credit facility in 2008.

Commercial
Paper

PPL
Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and
when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by the $200
million credit facility of PPL Electric.  PPL Electric had no
commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  During 2008, PPL Electric may issue commercial paper from time
to time to facilitate short-term cash flow needs.

Asset-Backed
Commercial Paper Program

PPL
Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
it obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
receivable and unbilled revenues to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary
on an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary pledges these assets to secure
loans of up to an aggregate of $150 million from a commercial paper conduit
sponsored by a financial institution.  PPL Electric uses the proceeds
from the program for general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize
letters of credit.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, loan balances
outstanding were $41 million and $42 million, all of which were being used to
cash collateralize letters of credit.  See Note 8 to the Financial
Statements for further discussion of the asset-backed commercial paper
program.

Contributions
from PPL

From time
to time PPL may make capital contributions to PPL Electric.  PPL
Electric may use these contributions for general corporate purposes, including
funding redemptions of existing debt.

Long-Term
Debt and Equity Securities

PPL
Electric currently does not plan to issue any long-term debt or equity
securities in 2008.

Forecasted Uses of
Cash

In
addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as
purchased power, payroll, and taxes, PPL Electric currently expects to incur
future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations
and payment of dividends on its common and preferred securities.

approximately $2.0 billion.  Capital expenditure plans are revised
periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory
conditions.  The table includes projected costs for the PJM-approved
regional transmission line expansion project.  See Note 9 to the
Financial Statements.

PPL
Electric plans to fund all of its capital expenditures in 2008 with cash on hand
and cash from operations.

Dividends

From time
to time, as determined by its Board of Directors, PPL Electric pays dividends on
its common stock to its parent, PPL, which uses the dividends for general
corporate purposes, including meeting its cash flow needs.

As
discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, PPL Electric may not pay
dividends on its common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full
dividends have been paid on the 6.25% Series Preference Stock for the
then-current dividend period.  Additionally, PPL Electric's 2001
Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments on its common stock in
the event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to
comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other
subsidiaries.  PPL Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of
such limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare
dividends.

PPL
Electric expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its outstanding
preferred securities, if and as declared by its Board of Directors.

Credit
Ratings

Moody's,
S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings on the debt and
preferred securities of PPL Electric and PPL Transition Bond
Company.  Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating
agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings
affirmations.

A credit
rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness
associated with an issuer and particular securities that it

Risk
Management

Market
Risk

Commodity
Price Risk - PLR Contracts

PPL
Electric and PPL EnergyPlus have power supply agreements under which PPL
EnergyPlus sells to PPL Electric (under a predetermined pricing arrangement)
energy and capacity to fulfill PPL Electric's PLR obligation through
2009.  As a result, PPL Electric has shifted any electric price risk
relating to its PLR obligation to PPL EnergyPlus through 2009.  See
Note 16 to the Financial Statements for information on the PLR
contracts.

Commodity
Price Risk - Post-PLR Contracts

In order
to mitigate the risk that PPL Electric will not be able to obtain adequate
energy supply subsequent to 2009, when the full requirements energy supply
agreements with PPL EnergyPlus expire, PPL Electric has entered into power
purchase agreements that include fixed prices.  PPL Electric's future
financial performance will be affected by its ability to enter into other new
supply contracts, the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to
prevailing market conditions, and the regulatory treatment for such contracts
and the associated recovery of its supply costs.  Depending on these
factors, PPL Electric's financial results may be materially adversely
affected.  See "Results of Operations - Earnings - 2008 Outlook" for
information on the PUC-approved procurement plan and other ongoing Pennsylvania
regulatory and legislative activities.

Interest
Rate Risk

PPL
Electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which exposes it to interest
expense risk.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, PPL Electric's potential
annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in
interest rates, was insignificant.

PPL
Electric is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt
portfolio.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Electric estimated that its
potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through
a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was $49 million, compared with $37
million at December 31, 2006.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

PPL
Electric's financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the
methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
accounting policies.  The following accounting policies are
particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of
PPL Electric, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently
uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these
accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information
presented in the Financial Statements.  (These accounting policies are
also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.)  PPL's senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates
and assumptions regarding them, with its Audit Committee.  In
addition, PPL's senior management has reviewed the following disclosures
regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee.

In 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements."  Among other
things, SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well as a framework for
measuring fair value.  In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157
through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to
FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair
Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under
Statement 13" and FSP FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
157."  FSP FAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude from its scope,
certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements
associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 delays the effective date of
SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
annually).

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL Electric will partially adopt SFAS 157, as
amended, effective January 1, 2008.  The January 1, 2008 adoption,
although not expected to be significant, is expected to affect the fair value
component of PPL Electric's critical accounting policy related to "Defined
Benefits" in future periods.  See Note 23 to the Financial Statements
for additional information regarding SFAS 157, as amended.

1)

Defined
Benefits

PPL
Electric participates in, and is allocated a significant portion of the
liability and net periodic defined benefit pension and other postretirement
costs of plans sponsored by PPL Services based on participation in those
plans.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting
for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these defined benefits.  In
addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of SFAS
158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans," effective December 31, 2006.  Subsequent to the adoption
of SFAS 158, PPL is required to record an asset or liability to recognize the
funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to
regulatory assets for the portion allocated to PPL
Electric.  Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit
plans is now fully recognized on the Balance Sheets and PPL no longer recognizes
additional minimum liability adjustments in other comprehensive income
(OCI).  See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional
information about the plans and the accounting for defined
benefits.

Under
these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and performance of plan assets.  Delayed
recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or
estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards.  Annual
net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on
these estimated results.  Any differences between actual and estimated
results are recorded as regulatory assets.  The regulatory assets are
amortized to income over future periods.  This delayed recognition in
income of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the
working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  The
primary assumptions are:

In
selecting a discount rate for its domestic defined benefit plans, PPL starts
with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its
plans.  This information is first matched against a spot-rate yield
curve.  A portfolio of over 500 Aa-graded non-callable (or callable
with make-whole provisions) bonds, with a total amount outstanding in excess of
$350 billion, serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest
yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve.  The
results of this analysis are considered together with other economic data and
movements in various bond indices to determine the discount rate
assumption.  At December 31, 2007, PPL increased the discount rate for
its domestic pension plans from 5.94% to 6.39% as a result of this assessment
and increased the discount rate for its other postretirement benefit plans from
5.88% to 6.26%.

In
selecting an expected return on plan assets, PPL considers tax implications,
past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the
plans.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's expected return on plan assets was
reduced from 8.50% to 8.25% for its domestic pension plans and increased from
7.75% to 7.80% for its other postretirement benefit plans.

In
selecting a rate of compensation increase, PPL considers past experience in
light of movements in inflation rates.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's
rate of compensation increase remained at 4.75% for its domestic
plans.

In
selecting health care cost trend rates, PPL considers past performance and
forecasts of health care costs.  At December 31, 2007, PPL's
health care cost trend rates were 9.0% for 2008, gradually declining to 5.5% for
2014.

A
variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the
accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic
defined benefit costs and the regulatory assets allocated to PPL
Electric.  The following chart reflects the sensitivities in the 2007
financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions based on
PPL's primary defined benefit plans.  While the charts below reflect
either an increase or decrease in each assumption, the inverse of this change
would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual
net periodic defined benefit costs and regulatory assets by a similar amount in
the opposite direction.  The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation
of the change based solely on a change in that assumption and does not include
income tax effects.

Loss
Accruals

PPL
Electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various
conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain
outcomes.  PPL Electric's accounting for such events is prescribed by
SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and other related accounting
guidance.  SFAS 5 defines a contingency as "an existing condition,
situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or
loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future
events occur or fail to occur."

For loss
contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that
indicates it is "probable" that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood
of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated.  The FASB defines "probable" as cases in which "the future
event or events are likely to occur."  SFAS 5 does not permit the
accrual of contingencies that might result in gains.  PPL Electric
continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental
remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other
events.

The
accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include:  (1) the
initial identification and recording of the loss; (2) the determination of
triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual; and (3) the ongoing
assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  All
three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant
judgment by PPL Electric's management.

Initial Identification and
Recording of the Loss Accrual

PPL
Electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and
engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been
incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

In 2005,
a significant loss accrual was initially recorded for the PJM billing
dispute.  Significant judgment was required by PPL Electric's
management to perform the initial assessment of this contingency.  In
2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy, Inc. (PECO),
filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC, alleging that PJM
had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as a result of an error by
PJM.  The complaint requested the FERC, among other things, to direct
PPL Electric to refund to PJM $39 million, plus interest of $8 million, and for
PJM to refund these same amounts to PECO.  In April 2005, the FERC
issued an Order Establishing Hearing and Settlement Judge Proceedings (the
Order).  In the Order, the FERC determined that PECO was entitled to
reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges that PECO asserted PJM
erroneously billed. The FERC ordered settlement discussions, before a judge, to
determine the amount of the overcharge to PECO and the parties responsible for
reimbursement to PECO.

Based on
an evaluation of the FERC Order, PPL Electric's management concluded that it was
probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the PJM billing
dispute.  PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual of $47 million, the
amount of PECO's claim, in the first quarter of 2005.

See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on this contingency
and see "Ongoing Assessment of Recorded Loss Accruals" for a discussion of the
year-end assessment of this contingency.

There
were no significant loss accruals initially recorded in 2007 or
2006.

PPL
Electric has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss, but
that do not meet the conditions for accrual under SFAS 5.  SFAS 5
requires disclosure, but not a recording, of potential losses when it is
"reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  The FASB defines
"reasonably possible" as cases in which "the chance of the future event or
events occurring is more than remote but less than likely."  See Note
15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of other potential loss
contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under SFAS
5.

Reducing Recorded Loss
Accruals

When an
estimated loss is accrued, PPL Electric identifies, where applicable, the
triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual.  The
triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the
actual loss is incurred, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been
eliminated.  The following are some of the triggering events that
provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals:

Â·

Allowances
      for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after
      prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of
      the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately
      collected.

Â·

Environmental
      and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is
      resolved and PPL Electric makes actual payments, a better estimate of the
      loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered
      probable.

Ongoing Assessment of
Recorded Loss Accruals

PPL
Electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the
recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient.  This involves
ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel,
engineers, operation management and other parties.

As part
of the year-end preparation of its 2006 financial statements, PPL Electric's
management re-assessed the loss accrual related to the PJM billing dispute,
described above under "Initial Identification and Recording of the Loss
Accrual.

In
December 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC, pursuant to a
November 2006 order, a modified offer of settlement (Compliance
Filing).  Under the Compliance Filing, PPL Electric would make a
single payment through its monthly PJM bill of $38 million, plus interest
through the date of payment, and PJM would include a single credit for this
amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill.  Through December 31, 2006, the
estimated interest on this payment was $4 million, for a total payment of $42
million.  Based on the Compliance Filing, PPL Electric reduced the
recorded loss accrual by $5 million at December 31, 2006.  PPL
determined that PPL Electric was responsible for the claims prior to July 1,
2000 (totaling $12 million), and that PPL EnergyPlus was responsible for the
claims subsequent to that date (totaling $30 million).  Accordingly,
PPL Electric recorded a receivable from PPL EnergyPlus of $30 million at
December 31, 2006, reduced the recorded liability to PJM by $5 million and
recorded credits to expense of $35 million, including $28 million of "Energy
purchases" and $7 million of "Interest Expense" on the Statement of
Income.

In March
2007, the FERC entered an order approving the Compliance Filing.  In
April 2007, PPL Electric paid PJM the full settlement amount of $43 million,
including additional interest of $1 million recorded during the three months
ended March 31, 2007.  PPL Energy Supply paid PPL Electric for its
portion of the settlement.  This proceeding is now terminated and no
contingency exists at December 31, 2007.

3)

Income
Tax Uncertainties

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL Electric's provision for
income taxes primarily due to uncertainty in various tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in tax returns.

Prior to
January 1, 2007, and in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
PPL Electric evaluated uncertain tax positions and accrued charges for probable
exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount of benefit that
should be recognized in the financial statements.  This assessment
resulted in management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for
each tax year.  In addition, management considered the reversal of
temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies in initially recording and reevaluating the need for
valuation allowances.

In June
2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."  In May 2007, the FASB
amended this guidance by issuing FSP FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No. 48."  PPL Electric and its subsidiaries adopted FIN
48, as amended, effective January 1, 2007.  The adoption of FIN 48
alters the methodology PPL Electric previously used to account for income tax
uncertainties.  Effective with the adoption of FIN 48, uncertain tax
positions are no longer considered to be contingencies assessed in accordance
with SFAS 5.

Similar
to SFAS 5, FIN 48 continues to require significant management judgment in
determining the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain
tax position.  FIN 48 requires PPL Electric to evaluate its tax
positions following a two-step process.  The first step requires an
entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a
particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50 percent
chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  This determination
assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is
aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  The
second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the
benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
criterion.  The measurement of the benefit equals the largest amount
of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds
50 percent.  PPL Electric 's management considers a number of
factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a
settlement.

On a
quarterly basis, PPL Electric reassesses its uncertain tax positions by
considering information known at the reporting date.  Based on
management's assessment of new information, PPL Electric may subsequently
recognize a tax benefit for a previously unrecognized tax position, de-recognize
a previously recognized tax position, or re-measure the benefit of a previously
recognized tax position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution
of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts
accrued and may materially impact PPL Electric's financial statements in the
future.

The
balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for
valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant
management judgment.  FIN 48 requires an entity to classify
unrecognized tax benefits as current, to the extent management expects to settle
an uncertain tax position, by paying cash, within one year of the reporting
date.  Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated
each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of
a deferred tax asset.  Management considers a number of factors in
assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of
temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies.  Any tax planning strategy utilized in this
assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria of FIN
48.  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for the disclosures
required by FIN 48.

4)

Regulation

PPL
Electric's electricity delivery business is cost-based
rate-regulated.  As a result, PPL Electric accounts for this business
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation," which requires cost-based rate-regulated entities
to reflect the effects of regulatory actions in their financial
statements.  PPL Electric records assets and liabilities that result
from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for
non-regulated entities.  Regulatory assets generally represent
incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future
recovery in regulated customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities
generally represent obligations to regulated customers for previous collections
of costs that have not yet been incurred but are expected to be incurred in the
future.  These amounts are recorded to income only when the associated
costs are incurred.

Management
continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future
recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and
political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates,
recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or
potential deregulation legislation.  Based on this continual
assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of
recovery.  This assessment reflects the current political and
regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in
the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, then
asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating
income.  Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility
in the manner and timing of the depreciation of PP&E and amortization of
regulatory assets.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, PPL Electric had regulatory assets of $837 million
and $1.2 billion.  All of PPL Electric's regulatory assets are either
currently being recovered under specific rate orders or represent amounts that
will be recovered in future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.

In August
2006, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania overturned the PUC's decision of
December 2004 that previously allowed PPL Electric to recover, over a 10-year
period, restoration costs incurred in connection with Hurricane Isabel in
September 2003.  As a result of the PUC's 2004 decision and in
accordance with SFAS 71, PPL Electric had established a regulatory asset for the
restoration costs.  Effective January 1, 2005, PPL Electric began
billing these costs to customers and amortizing the regulatory
asset.  The Commonwealth Court denied recovery of these costs because
they were incurred when PPL Electric was subject to capped rates for
transmission and distribution services, through December 31,
2004.  See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

Commission (the COSO criteria).  PPL Corporation's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting at Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, PPL Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets and statements
of long-term debt of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' common
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 2007 and expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Business and
Consolidation

(PPL)

PPL is an
energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily
engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in the northeastern and
western U.S. and in the delivery of electricity in Pennsylvania and the
U.K.  Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal direct
subsidiaries are PPL Energy Funding, PPL Electric, PPL Gas Utilities, PPL
Services and PPL Capital Funding.

In July
2007, PPL announced its intention to sell its natural gas distribution and
propane businesses. PPL expects to complete the sale during the second half of
2008.  See Note 10 for additional information.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
Energy Funding is the parent of PPL Energy Supply, which serves as the holding
company for PPL's principal unregulated subsidiaries.  PPL Energy
Supply is the parent of PPL Generation, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL
Global.

PPL
Generation owns and operates a portfolio of domestic power generating
assets.  These power plants are located in Pennsylvania, Montana,
Illinois, Connecticut, New York and Maine and use well-diversified fuel sources
including coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water.  PPL EnergyPlus
markets or brokers electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, along
with purchased power, natural gas and oil, in competitive wholesale and
deregulated retail markets, primarily in the northeastern and western
U.S.  PPL Global owns and operates international energy businesses
that are primarily focused on the distribution of electricity.

It is the
policy of PPL and PPL Energy Supply to consolidate foreign subsidiaries on a
one-month lag.  Material intervening events, such as debt issuances
and retirements, acquisitions or divestitures that occur in the lag period are
recognized in the current Financial Statements.  Significant, but not
material, events are disclosed.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its domestic telecommunication
operations.  See Note 9 for additional information.  Also in
2007, PPL Energy Supply completed the sale of its Latin American businesses in
Chile, El Salvador, and Bolivia.  In 2006 and 2005, PPL Energy Supply
completed the sale of its interest in the Griffith plant and the Sundance
plant.  See Note 10 for additional information on the above
sales.

The
consolidated financial statements of PPL and PPL Energy Supply include their
share of undivided interests in jointly-owned facilities, as well as their share
of the related operating costs of those facilities.  See Note 14 for
additional information.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric is a rate-regulated subsidiary of PPL.  PPL Electric's
principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve
retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central
Pennsylvania, and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that
territory as a PLR.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
consolidated financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric
include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in
which the company has a controlling financial interest.  (See Note 22
for additional information regarding variable interest
entities.)  Investments in entities in which the company has the
ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling
financial interest are accounted for under the equity method.  See
Note 3 for additional information.  All other investments are carried
at cost or fair value.  All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated.  Any minority interests are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements.

Regulation

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric and PPL Gas Utilities account for regulated operations in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation," which requires cost-based rate-regulated entities to reflect the
effects of regulatory actions in their financial statements.

The
regulatory assets below are either included in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent
Assets" or "Assets held for sale" on the Balance Sheets.

The
recoverable transition costs are the result of the PUC Final Order, which
allowed PPL Electric to begin amortizing its competitive transition (or
stranded) costs, $2.97 billion, over an 11-year transition period effective
January 1, 1999.  In August 1999, competitive transition costs of
$2.4 billion were converted to intangible transition costs when they were
securitized by the issuance of transition bonds.  The intangible
transition costs are being amortized over the life of the transition bonds,
through December 2008, in accordance with an amortization schedule filed with
the PUC.  The assets of PPL Transition Bond Company, including the
intangible transition property, are not available to creditors of PPL or PPL
Electric.  The transition bonds are obligations of PPL Transition Bond
Company and are non-recourse to PPL and PPL Electric.  The remaining
competitive transition costs are also being amortized based on an amortization
schedule previously filed with the PUC, adjusted for those competitive
transition costs that were converted to intangible transition
costs.  As a result of the conversion of a significant portion of the
competitive transition costs into intangible transition costs, amortization of
substantially all of the remaining competitive transition costs of $351 million
will occur in 2009.

Taxes
recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes
that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.  Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the
offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized.  In accordance with
SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," this regulatory asset and the deferred
tax liability are not offset for general-purpose financial reporting; rather,
each is displayed separately.  Because this regulatory asset does not
represent cash tax expenditures already incurred by PPL, this regulatory asset
is not earning a current return.  This regulatory asset is expected to
be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences
reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred.

Recoverable
costs of defined benefit plans represent the portion of unrecognized transition
obligation, prior service cost, and net actuarial gain that will be recovered
through future rates based upon established regulatory
practices.  These regulatory assets are adjusted annually or more
frequently if certain significant events occur, when the funded status of PPL's
defined benefit plans is remeasured, in accordance with the accounting
requirements for defined benefit plans as described in the "Defined Benefits"
section of this note.  These regulatory assets do not represent cash
expenditures already incurred; consequently, these assets are not earning a
current return.

Of these
costs, $11 million for PPL and PPL Electric are expected to be amortized into
net periodic benefit cost in 2008.  All costs will be amortized over
the lives of the defined benefit plans.

In
January 2005, severe ice storms hit PPL Electric's service
territory.  The total cost of restoring service, excluding capitalized
cost and regular payroll expenses, was $16 million.  In August 2005,
the PUC issued an order granting PPL Electric's petition for authority to defer
and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes a portion of these
storm costs subject to certain conditions.  As a result of the PUC
Order and in accordance with SFAS 71, PPL Electric deferred $12 million of its
previously expensed storm costs.  Recovery of these assets was
addressed in PPL Electric's distribution base rate case filed with the PUC in
March 2007.  In December 2007, the PUC approved the recovery of these
assets and as a result they will be amortized monthly beginning January 2008
through August 2015.

The
remainder of the regulatory assets included in "Other" will be recovered through
2013.

In August
2006, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania overturned the PUC's decision of
December 2004 that previously allowed PPL Electric to recover, over a 10-year
period, restoration costs incurred in connection with Hurricane Isabel in
September 2003.  As a result of the PUC's 2004 decision and in
accordance with SFAS 71, PPL Electric had established a regulatory asset for the
restoration costs.  Effective January 1, 2005, PPL Electric began
billing these costs to customers and amortizing the regulatory
asset.  The Commonwealth Court denied recovery of these costs because
they were incurred when PPL Electric was subject to capped rates for
transmission and distribution services, through December 31, 2004.  As
a result of the Court's decision in 2006, PPL Electric recorded a charge of $11
million, or $7 million after tax, in "Other operation and maintenance" on the
Statements of Income, reversed the remaining unamortized regulatory asset of $9
million and recorded a regulatory liability of $2 million for restoration costs
previously billed to customers from January 2005 through December
2006.  In August 2007, PPL Electric began refunding these costs on
customers' bills, which will continue through December 2009.

Accounting
Records

(PPL and PPL
Electric)

The
system of accounts for PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities are maintained in
accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and
adopted by the PUC.

Use
of Estimates

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Loss
Accruals

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Loss
accruals are recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
and other related accounting guidance.  Potential losses are accrued
when (1) information is available that indicates it is "probable" that a loss
has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2)
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  FASB defines
"probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to
occur."  SFAS 5 does not generally permit the accrual of contingencies
that might result in gains.  PPL continuously assesses potential loss
contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory
penalties and other events.  PPL discounts its loss accruals for
environmental remediation when appropriate.

PPL also
has accrued estimated losses on long-term purchase commitments when significant
events have occurred.  For example, estimated losses were accrued when
long-term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements
and when PPL Electric's generation business was deregulated.

Changes in
Classification

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
classification of certain amounts in the 2006 and 2005 financial statements have
been changed to conform to the current presentation.  The changes in
classification did not affect net income or total equity.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In 2007,
PPL sold its Latin American businesses and in July 2007, PPL announced its
intention to sell its natural gas distribution and propane
businesses.  In accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," the operating results of these
businesses are classified as "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations" on the
Statements of Income.  See Note 10 for further
discussion.  The Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows of
periods prior to 2007 were not impacted.

Comprehensive
Income

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

Comprehensive
income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as changes
in equity from transactions not related to shareowners.  Comprehensive
income is shown on PPL's Statements of Shareowners' Common Equity and
Comprehensive Income and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Member's Equity and
Comprehensive Income.

Accumulated
other comprehensive loss, which is presented on the Balance Sheets of PPL and
included in Member's Equity on the PPL Energy Supply Balance Sheets, consisted
of these after-tax amounts at December 31.

Risk Management

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the
variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units and
marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply enter into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge their
exposure to changes in the fair value of their debt instruments and to hedge
their exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing
debt instruments or forecasted issuances of debt.  PPL and PPL Energy
Supply also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign
currency exposures related to firm commitments, recognized assets or
liabilities, forecasted transactions, net investments and foreign earnings
translation.

Contracts
that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and
interpreted.  Certain energy contracts have been excluded from the
requirements of SFAS 133 because they meet the definition of a "normal purchase
or normal sale."  These contracts are reflected in the financial
statements using the accrual method of accounting.

All
derivative contracts that are subject to the requirements of SFAS 133 and its
amendments are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair
value.  These contracts are recorded as "Price risk management assets"
and "Price risk management liabilities" on the Balance
Sheets.  Short-term derivative positions are included in "Current
Assets" and "Current Liabilities."  PPL records long-term derivative
positions in "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and
Other Noncurrent Liabilities" and PPL Energy Supply records long-term derivative
positions in "Other Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other
Noncurrent Liabilities."  On the date the derivative contract is
executed, PPL may designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair
value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash
flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash
flow" hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign
currency" hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net
investment" hedge).  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recorded in either other comprehensive income or in current-period earnings in
accordance with SFAS 133.  Cash inflows and outflows related to
derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or
financing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the
underlying nature of the hedged items.

When
recognized on the Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from energy
contracts accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges, are reflected in
"Wholesale energy marketing," "Fuel," or "Energy purchases," consistent with the
hedged item.  Unrealized gains and losses from changes in market
prices of energy contracts accounted for as fair value hedges are reflected in
"Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income, as are changes in the underlying
position.  Additionally, PPL enters into certain non-trading energy or
energy-related contracts to hedge future cash flows or fair values that are not
eligible for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, or hedge accounting is not
elected.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on these
transactions are reflected in "Wholesale energy marketing" or "Energy
purchases," consistent with the hedged item.  Unrealized and realized
gains and losses on options to hedge synthetic fuel tax credits are reflected in
"Energy-related businesses" revenues.

PPL
Energy Supply accounts for non-trading bilateral sales and purchases in
accordance with EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not 'Held for Trading
Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3," to net non-trading bilateral sales of
electricity at major market delivery points with purchases that offset the sales
at those same delivery points.  A major market delivery point is any
delivery point with liquid pricing available.

Gains and
losses from interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts that hedge
interest payments, when recognized on the Statements of Income, are accounted
for in "Interest Expense."  Gains and losses from foreign currency
derivative contracts that economically hedge foreign earnings translation are
recognized in "Other Income - net."  Gains and losses from foreign
currency derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency payments for
equipment, when recognized on the Statements of Income, are accounted for in
"Depreciation."

See Note
18 for additional information on SFAS 133, its amendments and related accounting
guidance.

Revenue

Utility
Revenue

(PPL)

The

U.K. rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

The
Statements of Income "Utility" line item contains revenues from the U.K.
rate-regulated delivery operations.

(PPL
Electric)

Since
most of PPL Electric's operations are regulated, it is not meaningful to use a
"Utility" caption.  Therefore, the revenues of PPL Electric are
presented according to specific types of revenue.

Revenue
Recognition

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Operating
revenues, except for "Energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy
deliveries through the end of the calendar month.  Unbilled retail
revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered
throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the
month.  Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an
estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per
kWh.  Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to
reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are confirmed and
invoiced.  At that time, unbilled revenue is reversed and actual
revenue is recorded.

PPL
Energy Supply records energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is
delivered.  The wholesale sales and purchases that meet the criteria
in EITF 03-11 are reported net on the Statements of Income within "Wholesale
energy marketing."  Additionally, the bilateral sales and purchases
that are designated as trading activities are also reported net, in accordance
with EITF 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for
Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities," and are reported on the Statements of Income within "Net energy
trading margins."  Spot market activity that balances PPL Energy
Supply's physical trading positions is included on the Statements of Income in
"Net energy trading margins."

Certain
PPL subsidiaries participate in RTOs, primarily in PJM, but also in the
surrounding regions of New York (NYISO), New England (ISO-NE) and the Midwest
(MISO).  In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity
to its customers who have selected it as a supplier and a seller for PPL's
generation subsidiaries.  PPL Electric is a transmission owner and PLR
in PJM.  In ISO-NE, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving
entity, and a seller for PPL's New England generating assets.  In the
NYISO and MISO regions, PPL EnergyPlus acts as a marketer.  PPL
Electric does not participate in ISO-NE, NYISO or MISO.  A function of
interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements (generation
plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their MWh obligations (load plus
scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day.  If the net
result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with
a spot-market sale to the ISO at the respective market price for that hour; if
the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market
purchase from the ISO at the respective market price for that
hour.  ISO purchases and sales are not allocated to individual
customers.  PPL records the hourly net sales and purchases in its
financial statements as sales to and purchases from the respective
ISOs.

"Energy-related
businesses" revenue includes revenues from the mechanical contracting and
engineering subsidiaries, WPD's telecommunications and property subsidiaries and
PPL Global's proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity or cost
method of accounting, as described in the "Business and Consolidation" section
of this note.  The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries
record revenues from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a
percentage of the estimated total cost for each
contract.  Accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of
billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset on the Balance
Sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
contracts are recorded as a current liability on the Balance
Sheets.  The amount of costs in excess of billings was $10 million and
$9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the amount of billings in excess of
costs was $76 million and $50 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

During
2007, PPL recognized $55 million of revenue related to a settlement agreement
for cost-based payments based upon the RMR status of units at its Wallingford,
Connecticut generating facility.  See Note 15 for additional
information.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Trade
receivables are reported in the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount
adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Accounts
receivable collectibility is evaluated using a combination of factors, including
past due status based on contractual terms.  Reserve balances are
analyzed to assess the reasonableness of the balances in comparison to the
actual accounts receivable balances and write-offs.  Adjustments are
made to reserve balances based on the results of analysis, the aging of
receivables, and historical and industry trends.

Additional
specific reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, such as bankruptcies,
are recorded on a case-by-case basis after having been researched and reviewed
by management.  The nature of the item, trends in write-offs, the age
of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions are
considered as a basis for determining the adequacy of the reserve for
uncollectible account balances.

Trade
receivables are charged-off in the period in which the receivable is deemed
uncollectible.  Recoveries of trade receivables previously charged-off
are recorded when it is known they will be received.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2007, the California ISO reserves accounted for 44% and 85% of the
total allowance for doubtful accounts of PPL and PPL Energy Supply and 34% and
59% of those accounts at December 31, 2006.  See Note 15 for
additional information.

Cash

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply
and PPL Electric)

Cash
Equivalents

All
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Bank
deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that
have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted
cash and cash equivalents.  The change in restricted cash and cash
equivalents is reported as an investing activity in the Statements of Cash
Flows.  On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash
and cash equivalents is shown as "Restricted cash and cash equivalents" within
current assets, while the noncurrent portion is included in "Other" within other
noncurrent assets.  See Note 19 for the components of restricted cash
and cash equivalents.

Investments

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply
and PPL Electric)

Generally,
the original maturity date of an investment and management's ability to sell an
investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of
investments as either short-term or long-term.  Investments that would
otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or
use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure
in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation
of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.

Short-term
Investments

Short-term
investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are
considered highly liquid such as auction rate and similar securities that
provide for periodic reset of interest rates.  Short-term investments
have original maturities greater than three months and are included in
"Short-term investments" on the Balance Sheets of PPL and PPL Energy Supply and
in "Current Assets-Other" on the Balance Sheets of PPL Electric.

Investments in Debt and
Marketable Equity Securities

Investments
in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, and measured at amortized
cost, when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity.  Debt securities and marketable equity securities that are
acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near-term
are classified as trading.  Trading securities are generally held to
capitalize on fluctuations in their value.  All other investments in
debt and marketable equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale.  Both trading and available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value.  Any unrealized gains and losses for
trading securities are included in earnings.  Unrealized gains and
losses for available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in other
comprehensive income or are recognized currently in earnings when a decline in
fair value is determined to be other than temporary.  The specific
identification method is used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and
marketable equity securities.  See Note 21 for additional information
on available-for-sale securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds.

Long-Lived
and Intangible Assets

Property,
Plant and Equipment

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PP&E
is recorded at original cost, unless impaired.  If impaired, the asset
is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the asset's new cost
basis.  Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs,
construction overheads and financing costs, where applicable.  The
cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as
incurred.  PPL records costs associated with planned major maintenance
projects in the period in which the costs are incurred.  No costs are
accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

AFUDC is
capitalized as part of the construction costs for regulated
projects.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Interest
is capitalized as part of construction costs for non-regulated
projects.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply capitalize interest in accordance
with SFAS 34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost" for their unregulated
entities.  Interest incurred from borrowed funds used to construct,
purchase or invest in capital assets is not immediately expensed but rather
deferred.

The
following capitalized interest was excluded from "Interest Expense" on the
Statements of Income.

Depreciation

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Depreciation
is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods
including the straight-line, composite and group methods.  When a
component of PP&E is retired that was depreciated under the composite or
group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated
depreciation.  When all or a significant portion of an operating unit
that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the
property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any
gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by
regulators.

PPL and
its subsidiaries periodically review the useful lives of their fixed
assets.  In light of significant planned environmental capital
expenditures, PPL Generation conducted studies of the useful lives of Montour
Units 1 and 2 and Brunner Island Unit 3 during the first quarter of
2005.  Based on these studies, the useful lives of these units were
extended from 2025 to 2035, effective January 1, 2005.  In the second
quarter of 2005, PPL Generation conducted additional studies of the useful lives
of certain Eastern fossil-fuel and hydroelectric generation
plants.  The most significant change related to the useful lives of
Brunner Island Units 1 and 2 and Martins Creek Units 3 and 4, which were
extended from 2025 to 2035, effective July 1, 2005.  The effect of
these changes in useful lives for 2005 was to increase income from continuing
operations and net income, as a result of lower depreciation, by $7 million (or
$0.02 per share, basic and diluted, for PPL).

During
2005, as a result of the final regulatory outcome published by Ofgem of the most
recent price control review and an assessment of the economic life of meters,
WPD reduced the remaining useful lives of its existing meter stock to
approximately nine years.  The useful lives of new meters were reduced
from 40 years to 19 years.  The effect for 2005 was to decrease income
from continuing operations and net income, as a result of higher depreciation,
by $5 million (or $0.01 per share, basic and diluted, for
PPL).  During 2007, as a result of a further communication from Ofgem
relating specifically to prepayment meters, WPD reduced the remaining useful
lives of these meters from nine years to 18 months.  The effect for
2007 was to decrease income from continuing operations and net income, as a
result of higher depreciation, by $3 million (or $0.01 per share, basic and
diluted, for PPL).

In 2007,
WPD reviewed the useful lives of its distribution network
assets.  Effective April 1, 2007, after considering information
from Ofgem and other internal and external surveys, the weighted average useful
lives were extended to 54 years from 40 years.  The effect of this
change in useful lives for 2007 was to increase income from continuing
operations and net income, as a result of lower depreciation, by $13 million (or
$0.03 per share, basic and diluted, for PPL).

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a
business.  If several businesses are acquired in a single transaction,
the purchase price must be apportioned to each business based on the fair value
of each business.  Each business is then assigned to the appropriate
reporting unit and the related goodwill is calculated for each business and
included in that reporting unit.  PPL's reporting units are
significant businesses that have discrete financial information and the
operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management.  In
accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," PPL and its
subsidiaries do not amortize goodwill.

Other
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are valued at cost and amortized
over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of
the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used.

PPL and
its subsidiaries account for emission allowances as intangible
assets.  As such, emission allowances are expensed when
consumed.  In addition, vintage year swaps are accounted for at fair
value in accordance with SFAS 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29."

See Note
20 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible
assets.

Asset
Impairment

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries review long-lived assets, including intangibles, that are
subject to depreciation or amortization for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  An
impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is
not recoverable from estimated undiscounted future cash flows.  The
impairment charge is measured by the difference between the carrying amount of
the asset and its estimated fair value.  See Notes 9, 10 and 15 for a
discussion of asset impairment charges recorded.

Intangible
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more
frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be
impaired.  An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount
of the assets exceeds its fair value.  The difference represents the
amount of impairment.

Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually or more
frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a
reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.  PPL's
reporting units are at or one level below its operating segments.  If
the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair
value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated.  The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
goodwill in a business combination.  If the implied fair value of
goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for
an amount equal to that difference.

PPL also
reviews the residual value of leased assets.  Residual value is the
estimated fair value of the leased property at the end of the lease
term.  If the residual value is determined to be less than the
residual value that was originally recorded for the property, PPL must determine
whether the decrease is other than temporary.  If so, the residual
value would be revised using the new estimate and a loss would be recorded
currently.  If the residual value is found to be greater than the
original, no adjustment is needed.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries account for the retirement of its long-lived assets according
to SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses the
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," which clarifies certain aspects of
SFAS 143.  SFAS 143 requires legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized as liabilities in the financial
statements.  The initial obligation is measured at estimated fair
value.  An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value
of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the
asset.  Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased,
through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement, for
changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.  Estimated ARO
costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of various AROs and
the related assets, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material
changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the
obligations.

See Note
21 for a discussion of accounting for AROs.

Compensation
and Benefits

Defined
Benefits

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these defined
benefits.  In addition, PPL adopted the recognition and measurement
date provisions of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31,
2006.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 158, PPL is required to
record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined
benefit plans with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income (OCI) or
regulatory assets for certain regulated subsidiaries.  Consequently,
the funded status of all defined benefit plans is now fully recognized on the
Balance Sheets and PPL no longer recognizes additional minimum liability
adjustments in OCI.

PPL uses
a market-related value of plan assets in accounting for its pension
plans.  The market-related value of plan assets is calculated by
rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions,
disbursements and expected return on investments.  One-fifth of the
difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or
subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new
market-related value.

PPL uses
an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for
its pension plans.  Under the accelerated method, gains and losses in
excess of 10% but less than 30% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan
participants.  Gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's
projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period equal to one-half of the average future service period of the plan
participants.

See Note
13 for a discussion of defined benefits.

Stock-Based
Compensation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees
and restricted stock units and stock units to directors under several
stock-based compensation plans.  In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," which is known as SFAS 123(R)
and replaces SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by
SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure."  PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 123(R) effective
January 1, 2006.  See Note 12 for a discussion of SFAS
123(R).  Effective January 1, 2003, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation, as prescribed
by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," using the prospective
method of transition permitted by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
123."  The prospective method of transition requires PPL and its
subsidiaries to use the fair value method under SFAS 123 to account for all
stock-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled on or after January
1, 2003.  Thus, all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003, were
accounted for under the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," to the extent such awards are not
modified or settled.

Use of
the fair value method prescribed by both SFAS 123 and SFAS 123(R) requires PPL
and its subsidiaries to recognize compensation expense for stock options
issued.  Fair value for the stock options is determined using the
Black-Scholes options pricing model.  Stock options with graded
vesting (i.e., that vest in installments) are valued as a single
award.

PPL and
its subsidiaries were not required to recognize compensation expense for stock
options issued and accounted for under the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion
No. 25, since PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less
than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of
grant.  As currently structured, awards of restricted stock,
restricted stock units and directors' stock units result in the same amount of
compensation expense under the fair value method of SFAS 123 or SFAS 123(R) as
they would under the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25 since the
value of the awards are based on the fair value of PPL's common stock on the
date of grant.  See Note 12 for a discussion of stock-based
compensation.  Stock-based compensation is included in "Other
operation and maintenance" expense on the Statements of Income.

For 2005,
the difference between the pro forma effect on net income and EPS as if the fair
value method had been used to account for all outstanding stock-based
compensation awards and reported amounts would have been
insignificant.  In 2007 and 2006, PPL accounted for all stock-based
compensation awards under the fair value method.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

PPL
Energy Supply's stock-based compensation expense includes an allocation of PPL
Services' expense.

(PPL
Electric)

PPL
Electric's stock-based compensation expense, including awards granted to
employees and an allocation of costs of awards granted to employees of PPL
Services, was insignificant under both the intrinsic value and fair value
methods for each of 2007, 2006 and 2005.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

SFAS
123(R) provided additional guidance on the requirement to accelerate expense
recognition for employees who are at or near retirement age and who are under a
plan that allows for accelerated vesting upon an employee's
retirement.  Such guidance is relevant to prior accounting for
stock-based compensation under other accounting guidance.  PPL's
stock-based compensation plans allow for accelerated vesting upon an employee's
retirement.  Thus, for employees who are retirement eligible when
stock-based awards are granted, PPL recognizes the expense
immediately.  For employees who are not retirement eligible when
stock-based awards are granted, PPL amortizes the awards on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period up to the employee's
attainment of retirement age.  Retirement eligible has been defined by
PPL as the early retirement age of 55.  The adjustments below related
to retirement-eligible employees were recorded based on the aforementioned
clarification of existing guidance and are not related to the adoption of SFAS
123(R).

In 2005,
PPL recorded a charge of $10 million after tax, or $0.03 per share, to
accelerate stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees,
of which $5 million of the after-tax total, or $0.01 per share, was related to
periods prior to 2005.  The prior period amounts were not material to
previously issued financial statements.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

In 2005,
PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $7 million after tax to accelerate
stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, of which $3
million of the after-tax total was related to periods prior to
2005.  The prior period amounts were not material to previously issued
financial statements.

(PPL
Electric)

In 2005,
PPL Electric recorded a charge of $3 million after tax to accelerate stock-based
compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, of which $2 million of
the after-tax total was related to periods prior to 2005.  The prior
period amounts were not material to previously issued financial
statements.

Other

Income
Taxes

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
income tax provision for PPL and its subsidiaries is calculated in accordance
with SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  PPL and its domestic
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

Significant
management judgment is required in developing PPL's and its subsidiaries'
provision for income taxes.  This is primarily due to uncertainty in
various tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the
determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances and
estimating the phase-out range for synthetic fuel tax credits that is not
published by the IRS until April of the following year.

Prior to
January 1, 2007, and in accordance with SFAS 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"
PPL and its subsidiaries evaluated uncertain tax positions and accrued charges
for probable exposures based on management's best estimate of the amount of
benefit that should be recognized in the financial statements.  This
assessment resulted in management's best estimate of the ultimate settled tax
position for each tax year.

In June
2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."  In May 2007, the FASB
amended this guidance by issuing FSP FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No. 48."  PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48, as
amended, effective January 1, 2007.  The adoption resulted in the
recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings in 2007.  Under FIN 48, uncertain tax positions are no
longer considered to be contingencies assessed in accordance with SFAS
5.  FIN 48 requires an entity to evaluate its tax positions following
a two-step process.  The first step requires an entity to determine
whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it
is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will
be sustained.  This determination assumes that the relevant taxing
authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts
surrounding the tax position.  The second step requires an entity to
recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets
the recognition criterion.  The measurement of the benefit equals the
largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization that exceeds
50%.  If the more likely than not threshold is not met, it is
inappropriate to recognize any tax benefits associated with the tax
position.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues
raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and
may materially impact PPL's and its subsidiaries' financial statements in the
future.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their
basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating
losses and tax credit carryforwards.

PPL and
its subsidiaries record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  PPL and its
subsidiaries consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable
income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially
recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation
allowances.  If PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are able
to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred
tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing
tax expense in the period that such determination is made.  Likewise,
if PPL and its subsidiaries determine that they are not able to realize all or
part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation
allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that
such determination is made.

PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric defer investment tax credits when the credits are
utilized and are amortizing the deferred amounts over the average lives of the
related assets.

See Note
5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes.

(PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

The
income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric is calculated in
accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that taxable
income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and any domestic
subsidiaries each filed a separate consolidated return.  PPL Energy
Supply's intercompany tax receivable was $45 million at December 31, 2007, and
the intercompany tax liability was $17 million at December 31,
2006.  PPL Electric's intercompany tax receivable was $49 million and
$2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

The
provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based
upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and the
FERC.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for
regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP
is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance
Sheet.

Taxes,
Other Than Income

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries present sales taxes in "Accounts Payable" and value added taxes
in "Taxes" on their Balance Sheets.  These taxes are not reflected on
the Statements of Income.  See Note 5 for details on taxes included in
"Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income.

Leases

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries apply the provisions of SFAS 13, "Accounting for Leases," as
amended and interpreted, to all transactions that qualify for lease
accounting.  See Note 11 for a discussion of accounting for leases
under which PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are lessees.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
EnergyPlus is the lessor, for accounting purposes, of a 79.9 MW oil-powered
station in Shoreham, New York.  The Long Island Power Authority has
contracted to purchase all of the plant's capacity and ancillary services as
part of a 15-year power purchase agreement with PPL EnergyPlus, which ends in
2017.  The capacity payments in the power purchase agreement result in
the plant being classified as a direct-financing lease.  Additionally,
a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply is the lessor, for accounting purposes, of two
sales-type leases relating to an 8 MW on-site electrical generation plant and a
1.66 MW on-site electrical generation and thermal energy plant.

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, PPL and PPL Energy Supply had receivable balances of
$234 million and $240 million (included in "Current Assets - Other" and
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL and "Current Assets -
Other" and "Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" for PPL Energy Supply) and unearned
revenue balances of $120 million and $128 million (included in "Current
Liabilities - Other" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities -
Other").  The receivable balances include $66 million of an
unguaranteed residual value.  Rental income received during 2007, 2006
and 2005 was $15 million, $14 million and $15 million.  Total future
minimum lease payments expected to be received on these leases are estimated at
$17 million for each of the years from 2008 through 2012.

Fuel, Materials and
Supplies

(PPL)

Fuel,
materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
average cost method, except for natural gas, for which the last-in, first-out
cost method (LIFO) is used.  The carrying value of the LIFO inventory
was $14 million and $13 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  The
excess of replacement cost over carrying value was $13 million and $16 million
at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

(PPL

In
accordance with the provisions of FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission
of FASB Interpretation No. 34," the fair values of guarantees related to
arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2003, as well as guarantees
excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45, are
not recorded in the financial statements.  See Note 15 for further
discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees.

Treasury
Stock

(

PPL and PPL
Electric)

Treasury
shares are reflected on the balance sheet as an offset to shareowners' equity
under the cost method of accounting.  Treasury shares are not
considered outstanding in calculating EPS.

(PPL)

PPL held
no treasury stock at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  In 2006, PPL
retired all treasury shares, which totaled 62,174,729 shares, and restored them
to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  "Capital in excess
of par value" was reduced by $839 million as a result of the
retirement.  Total "Shareowners' Common Equity" was not
impacted.  PPL plans to restore all shares of common stock acquired in
the future to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon
acquisition.

(PPL
Electric)

PPL
Electric held no treasury stock at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  In 2006, PPL Electric retired all treasury shares, which
totaled 90,932,326 shares, and restored them to authorized but unissued shares
of common stock.  "Common stock" was reduced by $1.1 billion as a
result of the retirement.  Total "Shareowners' Equity" was not
impacted.  PPL Electric plans to restore all shares of common stock
acquired in the future to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon
acquisition.

Foreign Currency Translation
and Transactions

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Assets
and liabilities of international operations, where the local currency is the
functional currency, are translated at the exchange rates on the date of
consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the year.  Adjustments resulting from
translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The
effect of translation is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon
the sale or substantial liquidation of the international subsidiary that gave
rise to the translation adjustment.  The local currency is the
functional currency for all of PPL's international operating companies except
for those located in Bolivia, where the U.S. dollar is the functional
currency.

Gains or
losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in
income.  The net transaction losses were insignificant in 2007, 2006
and 2005.

Segment and Related Information

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL's
reportable segments are Supply, International Delivery and Pennsylvania
Delivery.  The Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic
energy marketing, domestic generation and domestic development operations of PPL
Energy Supply.  In August 2007, PPL completed the sale of its domestic
telecommunication operations, which were previously included in the Supply
segment.  See Note 9 for additional information.

The
International Delivery segment includes operations of the international energy
businesses of PPL Global that are primarily focused on the distribution of
electricity.  In 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Latin American
businesses located in Bolivia, El Salvador and Chile.  See Note 10 for
additional information.  PPL Global's major remaining international
business is WPD, which is located in the U.K.

The
Pennsylvania Delivery segment includes the regulated electric and gas delivery
operations of PPL Electric and PPL Gas Utilities.  In July 2007, PPL
announced its intention to sell its natural gas distribution and propane
businesses.  See Note 10 for additional information.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," the operating results of the Latin American businesses and
the natural gas distribution and propane businesses have been classified as
Discontinued Operations on the Statements of Income.  Therefore, with
the exception of net income, the operating results from these businesses have
been excluded from the income statement data tables below.

PPL
Energy Supply's reportable segments are Supply and International
Delivery.  The International Delivery segment at the PPL Energy Supply
level is consistent with the International Delivery segment at the PPL
level.  The Supply segment information reported at the PPL Energy
Supply level will not agree with the Supply segment information reported at the
PPL level because additional Supply segment functions exist at PPL that are
outside of PPL Energy Supply.  Furthermore, certain income items,
including PLR revenue and certain interest income, exist at the PPL Energy
Supply level but are eliminated in consolidation at the PPL
level.  Finally, certain expense items are fully allocated to the
segments at the PPL level only.

Segments
include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate service
costs, from PPL Services.  These service costs include functions such
as financial, legal, human resources and information services.  See
Note 16 for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

(PPL)

In August
2005, PPL completed a 2-for-1 split of its common stock.  The
distribution date was August 24, 2005.  The share and per-share
amounts included in these financial statements have been adjusted for all
periods presented to reflect the stock split.

Basic EPS
is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding that are increased for
additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
were converted to common shares.  Potentially dilutive securities
consist of:

Â·

stock
      options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the
      incentive compensation plans;

Â·

stock
      units representing common stock granted under the directors compensation
      programs; and

Â·

convertible

In 2003,
PPL Energy Supply issued $400 million of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due
2023 (Convertible Senior Notes).  The notes are guaranteed by PPL and,
as originally issued, could be converted into shares of PPL common stock
if:

The
conversion rate is 40.2212 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or
$24.8625 per share).  It will be adjusted if certain specified
distributions, whether in the form of cash, stock, other equity interests,
evidence of indebtedness or assets, are made to holders of PPL common
stock.  Additionally, the conversion rate can be increased by PPL if
its Board of Directors has made a determination that to do so would be in the
best interest of either PPL or holders of PPL common stock.

If
holders elect to convert upon the occurrence of a conversion event identified
above, PPL Energy Supply is required to settle the principal amount in cash and
is permitted to settle any conversion premium in cash or PPL common
stock.

The
Convertible Senior Notes have a dilutive impact when the average market price of
PPL common stock equals or exceeds $24.87.

See Note
8 for discussion of attainment of the market price trigger related to the
Convertible Senior Notes and the related conversions during 2007.

At
December 31, 2007, $57 million of Convertible Senior Notes remained
outstanding.  The maximum number of shares of PPL common stock that
could potentially be issued to settle the conversion premium, based upon the
current conversion rate, is 2,297,837 shares.  Based on PPL's common
stock price at December 31, 2007, the conversion premium equated to 1,201,082
shares of PPL common stock, or $63 million.

See Note
8 for discussion of a PPL common stock repurchase program initiated during the
second quarter of 2007.

During
2007, PPL issued 2,289,804 shares of common stock related to the exercise of
stock options, vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and
conversion of stock units granted to directors under its stock-based
compensation plans.  See Note 12 for a discussion of PPL's stock-based
compensation plans.

The
following number of stock options to purchase PPL common shares were excluded in

were not significant at December 31, 2007.  PPL had federal foreign
tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2016 of $10 million and $20 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006.  PPL also had state net operating loss
carryforwards that expire between 2016 and 2027 of $227 million and $216 million
at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Valuation allowances have been
established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be
realized.

PPL
Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $37 million at both
December 31, 2007 and 2006.  PPL Global also had foreign capital loss
carryforwards of $596 million and $563 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward
period.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount
that, more likely than not, will not be realized.  In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations," which is known
as SFAS 141(R) and replaces SFAS 141.  Upon adoption, effective
January 1, 2009, SFAS 141(R) will require changes in valuation allowances
associated with business combinations to be recognized in tax expense rather
than in goodwill.  See Note 23 for additional
information.  Of the total valuation allowances related to foreign
capital loss carryforwards, $83 million is currently allocable to
goodwill.

PPL
Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings are
permanently reinvested.  The cumulative undistributed earnings are
included in "Earnings reinvested" on the Balance Sheets.  The amounts
considered permanently reinvested at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are $1.1
billion and $910 million.  If the earnings are remitted as dividends,
PPL Global may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax
credits.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

For tax
years 2000 through 2007, PPL Montana protested certain property tax assessments
by the Montana Department of Revenue on its generation
facilities.  The tax liabilities in dispute for 2000 through 2007,
which have been paid and expensed by PPL Montana, total $45
million.  In January 2008, both parties reached a settlement for all
years outstanding.  The settlement will result in PPL Montana
receiving a refund of taxes paid and interest totaling $8
million.  This amount will be recorded in 2008.

PPL
Energy Supply had no federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with
an indefinite carryforward period at December 31, 2007, and $27 million at
December 31, 2006.  PPL Energy Supply had federal foreign tax credit
carryforwards that expire in 2016 of $10 million and $20 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006.  PPL Energy Supply also had state net
operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2016 and 2027 of $8 million and
$9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Valuation allowances have
been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be
realized.

PPL
Global had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $37 million at both
December 31, 2007 and 2006.  PPL Global also had foreign capital loss
carryforwards of $596 million and $563 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  All of these losses have an unlimited carryforward
period.  Valuation allowances have been established for the amount
that more likely than not, will not be realized.  In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS 141(R).  Upon adoption, effective January 1,
2009, SFAS 141(R) will require changes in valuation allowances associated with
business combinations to be recognized in tax expense rather than in
goodwill.  See Note 23 for additional information.  Of the
total valuation allowances related to foreign capital loss carryforwards, $83
million is currently allocable to goodwill.

PPL
Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
its foreign subsidiaries where management has determined that the earnings are
permanently reinvested.  The cumulative undistributed earnings are
included in "Member's Equity" on the Balance Sheets.  The amounts
considered permanently reinvested at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are $1.1
billion and $910 million.  If the earnings are remitted as dividends,
PPL Global may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax
credits.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings.

(PPL

The
provision for PPL Electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based
upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the PUC and the
FERC.  The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for
regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under U.S. GAAP
is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in
"Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on the Balance

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In June
2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."  In May 2007, the FASB
amended this guidance by issuing FSP FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No. 48."  PPL and its subsidiaries adopted FIN 48, as
amended, effective January 1, 2007.  The adoption resulted in the
following increases (decreases) to the Balance Sheet at January 1,
2007.

(a)

Upon
      adoption, effective January 1, 2009, SFAS 141(R) will require changes in
      unrecognized tax benefits associated with business combinations to be
      recognized in tax expense rather than in goodwill.  These
      amounts do not consider the impact of SFAS 141(R).  See Note 23
      for additional information.

At
December 31, 2007, it was reasonably possible that during the next twelve months
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $82
million for PPL, decrease between $5 million and $67 million for PPL Energy
Supply and decrease by up to $10 million for PPL Electric. These decreases
could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in
measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the creditability of foreign
taxes, the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits and the related impact
on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of
certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing
groups. The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements
with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by
relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of
limitations.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric had accrued interest
of $31 million, $26 million and $4 million.

PPL and
its subsidiaries recognize interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits
in "Income Taxes" on their Statements of Income.  In 2007, PPL and PPL
Energy Supply recognized a $1 million and a $4 million net benefit from the
accrual of additional interest and the reversal of accrued interest and
penalties, primarily related to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations
with respect to certain issues.  PPL Electric recognized a $3 million
net expense from the accrual of additional interest and the reversal of accrued
interest, primarily related to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations
with respect to certain issues.

PPL or
its subsidiaries file tax returns in five major tax jurisdictions. PPL
Energy Supply's and PPL Electric's U.S. federal and state tax provision are
calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy with PPL, which
provides that their taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply and its
domestic subsidiaries and PPL Electric and its subsidiaries each filed a
separate consolidated tax return. Based on this tax sharing policy, PPL
Energy Supply or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in
five major tax jurisdictions and PPL Electric or its subsidiaries indirectly or
directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions.  With few
exceptions, at December 31, 2007, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years
that are no longer subject to examination, were as follows:

Financial Instruments

(PPL,

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds,
other investments and short-term debt represented or approximated fair value due
to the liquid nature of the instruments, variable interest rates associated with
the financial instruments or existing requirements to record the carrying value
of the instruments at fair value.  Price risk management assets and
liabilities are recorded at fair value using exchange-traded market quotes,
prices obtained through third-party brokers or internally developed price
curves.  Financial instruments where the carrying amount on the
Balance Sheets and the estimated fair value (based on quoted market prices for
the securities where available and estimates based on current rates where quoted
market prices are not available) are different, are set forth

(b)

During
      2006, 2.5 million shares were issued for $250 million in connection with
      the sale of 10 million depositary shares, each representing a quarter
      interest in a share of PPL Electric's 6.25% Series Preference
      Stock.

(c)

Redeemable
      on or after April 6, 2011 for $100 per share (equivalent to $25 per
      depositary share).

Preferred
Stock

The
involuntary liquidation price of the preferred stock is $100 per
share.  The optional voluntary liquidation price is the optional
redemption price per share in effect, except for the 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and
the 6.75% Series Preferred Stock for which such price is $100 per share (plus,
in each case, any unpaid dividends in arrears).

Dividends
on the preferred stock are cumulative.  Preferred stock ranks senior
to PPL Electric's common stock and its 6.25% Series Preference Stock (Preference
Shares).

Holders
of the outstanding preferred stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters
on which PPL Electric's shareowners are entitled to vote.  However, if
dividends on any preferred stock are in arrears in an amount equal to or greater
than the annual dividend rate, the holders of the preferred stock are entitled
to elect a majority of the Board of Directors of PPL Electric.

Preference
Stock

Holders
of the depositary shares, each of which represents a quarter interest in a share
of Preference Shares, are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of
the Preference Shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation
rights, exercised through the bank acting as a depositary.  The
Preference Shares rank senior to PPL Electric's common stock and junior to its
preferred stock, and they have no voting rights, except as provided by
law.

Dividends
on the Preference Shares will be paid when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, or $1.5625 per depositary share per
year, and are not cumulative.  PPL Electric may not pay dividends on,
or redeem, purchase or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of its
common stock, except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends on the
Preference Shares have been paid for the then-current dividend
period.

In May
2006, PPL Electric filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that,
among other things, increased the authorized amount of preference stock from 5
million to 10 million shares, without nominal or par value.

Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities

Credit
Arrangements

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
Energy Supply maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and
provide credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper
program.

In March
2007, PPL Energy Supply extended the expiration date of its 364-day
reimbursement agreement to March 2008.  Under the agreement, PPL
Energy Supply can cause the bank to issue up to $200 million of letters of
credit but cannot make cash borrowings.  At December 31, 2007 and
2006, there were $156 million and $47 million of letters of credit outstanding
under this agreement.

In May
2007, PPL Energy Supply entered into a $3.4 billion Second Amended and Restated
Five-Year Credit Agreement, which amended its previously existing $1.9 billion
credit facility and extended the term of the previously existing facility to
June 2012.  Under certain conditions, PPL Energy Supply may elect to
have the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the final maturity date
of the facility continue as non-revolving term loans for a period of one year
from that final maturity date.  Also, under certain conditions, PPL
Energy Supply may request that the facility's principal amount be increased by
up to $500 million.  PPL Energy Supply has the ability to cause the
lenders under this facility to issue letters of credit.  At December
31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply had no cash borrowings and $269 million of letters
of credit outstanding under this facility.  There were no cash
borrowings and $51 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $1.9
billion credit facility that existed at December 31, 2006.

PPL
Energy Supply also maintains a $300 million five-year letter of credit and
revolving credit facility expiring in March 2011.  There were no cash
borrowings and $258 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility
at December 31, 2007, and no cash borrowings and $222 million of letters of
credit outstanding at December 31, 2006.  PPL Energy Supply's
obligations under this facility are supported by a $300 million letter of credit
issued on PPL Energy Supply's behalf under a separate $300 million five-year
letter of credit and reimbursement agreement, also expiring in March
2011.

PPL
Energy Supply maintains a commercial paper program for up to $500 million to
provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs,
if and when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by
PPL Energy Supply's $3.4 billion five-year credit facility.  PPL
Energy Supply had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

In
January 2007, WPD (South West) terminated its Â£150 million three-year committed
credit facility, which was to expire in October 2008.  This facility
was replaced by a new Â£150 million five-year committed credit facility at WPDH
Limited that expires in January 2012, with the option to extend the expiration
date by a maximum of two years.  WPD (South West)'s Â£100 million
364-day committed credit facility expired in November 2007 and was not
renewed.  As of December 31, 2007, WPD (South West) maintained a Â£150
million five-year committed credit facility that expires in October
2009.  WPD's total committed facilities at December 31, 2007, were
Â£300 million (approximately $617 million).  There were no cash
borrowings under WPD's committed credit facilities at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  WPD (South West) also had uncommitted credit facilities of Â£65
million (approximately $134 million) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, under which
there were Â£25 million (approximately $51 million) of cash borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 2007, with a weighted-average interest rate of
6.37%, and no cash borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric maintains credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide
credit support, and as a backstop to its commercial paper program.

In May
2007, PPL Electric entered into a $200 million Third Amended and Restated
Five-Year Credit Agreement, which extended the term of its existing credit
facility to May 2012.  Under certain conditions, PPL Electric may
elect to have the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the final
maturity date of the facility continue as non-revolving term loans for a period
of one year from that final maturity date.  Also, under certain
conditions, PPL Electric may request that the facility's principal amount be
increased by up to $100 million.  PPL Electric has the ability to
cause the lenders under this facility to issue letters of credit.  PPL
Electric had no cash borrowings and an insignificant amount of letters of credit
outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 and no cash borrowings or
letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006.

PPL
Electric maintains a commercial paper program for up to $200 million to provide
an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and
when necessary.  Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL
Electric's $200 million five-year credit facility.  PPL Electric had
no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

PPL
Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which
PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts
receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary on
an ongoing basis.  The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure
loans from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial
institution.  PPL Electric uses the proceeds from the credit agreement
for general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of
credit.  The subsidiary's borrowing limit under this credit agreement
is $150 million, and interest under the credit agreement varies based on the
commercial paper conduit's actual cost to issue commercial paper that supports
the debt.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $126 million and $136
million of accounts receivable and $171 million and $145 million of unbilled
revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement.  At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, there was $41 million and $42 million of short-term
debt outstanding under the credit agreement at an interest rate of 5.11% for
2007 and 5.35% for 2006, all of which was being used to cash collateralize
letters of credit issued on PPL Electric's behalf.  At
December 31, 2007, based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue
pledged, an additional $109 million was available for borrowing.  The
funds used to cash collateralize the letters of credit are reported in
"Restricted cash and cash equivalents" on the Balance Sheets.  PPL
Electric's sale to its subsidiary of the accounts receivable and unbilled
revenue is an absolute sale of the assets, and PPL Electric does not retain an
interest in these assets.  However, for financial reporting purposes,
the subsidiary's financial results are consolidated in PPL Electric's financial
statements.  PPL Electric performs certain record-keeping and cash
collection functions with respect to the assets in return for a servicing fee
from the subsidiary.  In July 2007, PPL Electric and the subsidiary
extended the expiration date of the credit agreement to July 2008.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In 2001,
PPL Electric completed a strategic initiative to confirm its legal separation
from PPL and PPL's other affiliated companies.  This initiative was
designed to enable PPL Electric to substantially reduce its exposure to
volatility in energy prices and supply risks through 2009 and to reduce its
business and financial risk profile by, among other things, limiting its
business activities to the transmission and distribution of electricity and
businesses related to or arising out of the electric transmission and
distribution businesses.  In connection with this initiative, PPL
Electric:

The
enhancements to PPL Electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended
to minimize the risk that a court would order PPL Electric's assets and
liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of PPL or another
affiliate of PPL in the event that PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become a
debtor in a bankruptcy case.  Based on these various measures, PPL
Electric was able to issue and maintain a higher level of debt and use it to
replace higher cost equity, thereby maintaining a lower total cost of
capital.  Nevertheless, if PPL or another PPL affiliate were to become
a debtor in a bankruptcy case, there can be no assurance that a court would not
order PPL Electric's assets and liabilities to be consolidated with those of PPL
or such other PPL affiliate.

The
subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities.  PPL's subsidiaries
are not liable for the debts of PPL.  Accordingly, creditors of PPL
may not satisfy their debts from the assets of the subsidiaries absent a
specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as
required by applicable law or regulation.  Similarly, absent a
specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation,
PPL is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries.  Accordingly,
creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of
PPL absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL to pay the creditors of its
subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or regulation.

Similarly,
the subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are separate legal
entities.  These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric.  Accordingly, creditors of PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their
subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay
the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.  In
addition, absent a specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable
law or regulation, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric are not liable for the
debts of their subsidiaries.  Accordingly, creditors of these
subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Energy Supply or
PPL Electric absent a specific contractual undertaking by that parent to pay the
creditors of its subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or
regulation.

Financing
Activities

(PPL)

In March
2007, PPL Capital Funding issued $500 million of 2007 Series A Junior
Subordinated Notes due 2067 (Notes).  The Notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by PPL as to payment of principal, interest and
premium, if any.  The Notes mature in March 2067, and are callable at
par value beginning in March 2017.  Prior to such time, the Notes may
be redeemed at PPL Capital Funding's option at make-whole redemption
prices.  The Notes bear interest at 6.70% from the date of issuance
into March 2017.  Beginning in March 2017, and continuing up to the
maturity date, the Notes bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.665%, reset
quarterly.  PPL Capital Funding may defer interest payments on the
Notes, from time to time, on one or more occasions for up to ten consecutive
years.  Deferred interest payments will accumulate additional interest
at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the
Notes.  During any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest
payments on the Notes, subject to certain exceptions, neither PPL Capital
Funding nor PPL may (i) declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its
capital stock, (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with
respect to any of its capital stock, or (iii) make any payments on any debt or
any guarantee of debt by PPL that is equal or junior in right of payment to the
Notes or the related guarantee by PPL.

PPL
Capital Funding received $493 million of proceeds, net of a discount and
underwriting fees, from the issuance of the Notes.  Of the proceeds,
$281 million were used to pay at maturity PPL Capital Funding's 8.375%
Medium-Term Notes due June 2007.  The remainder of the net proceeds
was used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures relating
to the installation of pollution control equipment by PPL Energy Supply
subsidiaries.

In
connection with the issuance of the Notes, PPL and PPL Capital Funding entered
into a Replacement Capital Covenant, in which PPL and PPL Capital Funding agreed
for the benefit of holders of a designated series of unsecured long-term
indebtedness of PPL or PPL Capital Funding ranking senior to the Notes that (i)
PPL Capital Funding will not redeem or purchase the Notes, or otherwise satisfy,
discharge or defease the principal amount of the Notes and (ii) neither PPL nor
any of its other subsidiaries will purchase the Notes before the end of March
2037, except, subject to certain limitations, to the extent that the applicable
redemption or repurchase price or principal amount defeased does not exceed a
specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying replacement capital
securities during the 180-day period prior to the date of that redemption,
repurchase or defeasance.  The designated series of covered debt
benefiting from the Replacement Capital Covenant at December 31, 2007 was PPL
Capital Funding's 4.33% Notes Exchange Series A due March
2009.  Effective March 1, 2008, the designated series of covered debt
will be PPL Capital Funding's $100 million aggregate principal amount of 6.85%
Senior Notes due 2047 (6.85% Notes), which were issued in July
2007.

The 6.85%
Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PPL as to payment of principal
and interest.  They are not subject to redemption prior to July
2012.  Beginning in July 2012, PPL Capital Funding may, at its option,
redeem the 6.85% Notes, in whole or in part, at par.  PPL Capital
Funding received $97 million of proceeds, net of underwriting fees, from the
issuance of the 6.85% Notes.  The proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures relating to the installation
of pollution control equipment by PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries.

In
November 2007, PPL Capital Funding retired the remaining $2 million of its 6.84%
Medium-Term Notes upon maturity.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The terms
of PPL Energy Supply's 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (Convertible
Senior Notes) include a market price trigger that permits holders to convert the
notes during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of PPL's common stock
exceeds $29.83 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal
quarter.  Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes were entitled to
convert their notes at any time during 2007 and are also entitled to convert
their notes any time during the first quarter of 2008 as a result of the market
price trigger being met.  As discussed in Note 4, when holders elect
to convert the Convertible Senior Notes, PPL Energy Supply is required to settle
the principal amount in cash and any conversion premium in cash or PPL common
stock.  During 2007, Convertible Senior Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of $45 million were presented for conversion.  The
total conversion premium related to these conversions was $44 million, which was
settled with 898,181 shares of PPL common stock, along with an insignificant
amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares.  At December 31, 2007,
$57 million of Convertible Senior Notes remained outstanding.

In
December 2006, Elfec issued $11 million of 6.05% UFV (inflation-adjusted
bolivianos) denominated bonds with serial maturities from 2012 through
2014.  Of these bonds, $5 million were issued in exchange for existing
bonds with maturities in 2007 and 2008.  This exchange is not
reflected in the Statements of Cash Flows since it represents a non-cash
financing activity.  Cash proceeds of $6 million were used in January
2007 to refinance bonds with maturities in 2007.  These transactions
were reflected in PPL's 2007 financial statements due to the one-month lag in
foreign subsidiary reporting.

In
February 2007, WPD LLP redeemed all of the 8.23% Subordinated Debentures due
2027 that were held by SIUK Capital Trust I.  Upon redemption, WPD LLP
paid a premium of 4.115%, or approximately $3 million, on the principal amount
of $85 million of subordinated debentures.  In connection with this
redemption, SIUK Capital Trust I was required to use all of the proceeds
received from the repayment of the subordinated debentures to redeem all of its
common and preferred securities.  WPD LLP received $3 million when its
investment in SIUK Capital Trust I was liquidated.  See Note 22 for a
discussion of the trust.  The redemption of the subordinated
debentures and the trust's common and preferred securities resulted in a loss of
$2 million, after tax, which is included in "Interest Expense" for PPL and
"Interest Expense with Affiliates" for PPL Energy Supply on the Statement of
Income.  Payment of $29 million was also made to settle related
cross-currency swaps and is included on the Statement of Cash Flows as a
component of "Retirement of long-term debt."

In
December 2007, PPL Energy Supply issued $50 million of 6.20% Senior Notes due
2016 (6.20% Notes), which are of the same series as the 6.20% Senior Notes due
2016 that were issued by PPL Energy Supply in 2006.  The 6.20% Notes
may be redeemed any time prior to maturity at PPL Energy Supply's option at
make-whole redemption prices.  PPL Energy Supply received $49 million
of proceeds, net of a discount and underwriting fees and exclusive of accrued
interest, from the issuance of the 6.20% Notes.  The proceeds were
used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures relating to
the installation of pollution control equipment by PPL Energy Supply
subsidiaries.

In
December 2007, the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority (PEDFA)
issued $81 million aggregate principal amount of Exempt Facilities Revenue
Bonds, Series 2007 due 2037 (Bonds) on behalf of PPL Energy
Supply.  The Bonds are structured as variable-rate remarketable
bonds.  They accrue interest through January 2008 at the initial rate
of 3.20%.  Effective February 2008, the Bonds are subject to daily
remarketing until such time that PPL Energy Supply elects to change the
frequency of the remarketing.  PPL Energy Supply may convert the
interest rate on the Bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily
rate, weekly rate or a term rate of at least one year, as determined by the
remarketing agent.  The Bonds are subject to mandatory purchase under
certain circumstances, including upon conversion to a different interest rate
mode.

To the
extent that a purchase is required prior to the maturity date, PPL Energy Supply
has the ability and intent to refinance such obligation on a long-term
basis.

In
connection with the issuance of the Bonds by the PEDFA, PPL Energy Supply
entered into a loan agreement with the PEDFA pursuant to which the Authority has
loaned to PPL Energy Supply the proceeds of the Bonds on payment terms that
correspond to the Bonds.  PPL Energy Supply issued a note to the PEDFA
to evidence its obligations under the loan agreement.  The proceeds
will be used to finance a portion of the costs relating to the installation of
sulfur dioxide scrubbers at the Brunner Island and Montour generation
facilities.  At December 31, 2007, $19 million of the proceeds was
held in escrow by the trustee and was recorded as restricted cash equivalents
within "Regulatory and Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on PPL's Balance Sheet
and "Other Noncurrent Assets - Other" on PPL Energy Supply's Balance
Sheet.  PPL Energy Supply may requisition funds from the trustee as it
incurs additional costs in connection with the installation of the
scrubbers.

Concurrent
with the issuance of the Bonds, a letter of credit in the amount of $81 million
was issued under PPL Energy Supply's $3.4 billion five-year credit facility to
the trustee in support of the Bonds.  The letter of credit permits the
trustee to draw amounts to pay principal of and interest on, and the purchase
price of, the Bonds when due.  PPL Energy Supply is required to
reimburse any draws on the letter of credit within one business day of such
draw.

In
December 2007, WPD (South West) redeemed all $175 million of its 6.875% Senior
Notes upon maturity.  Payment of $36 million was also made to settle
related cross-currency swaps and is included on the Statement of Cash Flows as a
component of "Retirement of long-term debt."  Although financial
information of foreign subsidiaries is recorded on a one-month lag, these
December 2007 transactions are reflected in the 2007 Financial Statements due to
the materiality of the redemption.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In August
2007, PPL Electric issued $250 million of 6.45% Senior Secured Bonds due
2037.  The bonds are secured by (i) an equal principal amount of First
Mortgage Bonds issued under the 1945 First Mortgage Bond Indenture and (ii) the
lien of the 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture, which is junior to the lien of
the 1945 First Mortgage Bond Indenture.  The bonds may be redeemed at
any time prior to maturity at PPL Electric's option at make-whole redemption
prices.  PPL Electric received $248 million of proceeds, net of a
discount and underwriting fees, from the issuance of the bonds.  The
proceeds were used, together with cash on hand, to pay at maturity $255 million
aggregate principal amount of PPL Electric's Senior Secured Bonds, 5-7â8%
Series, due August 2007.

During
2007, PPL Transition Bond Company made principal payments on transition bonds of
$300 million.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

(PPL)

In June
2007, PPL's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by PPL of up to $750
million of its common stock from time to time, in open market purchases,
pre-arranged trading plans or privately negotiated transactions.  The
specific amount and timing of repurchases is based on a variety of factors,
including potential share repurchase price, strategic investment considerations
and other market and economic factors.  As of December 31, 2007, PPL
repurchased 14,929,892 shares of its common stock for $712 million, which was
primarily recorded as a reduction to "Capital in excess of par value" on the
Balance Sheet.  Through February 28, 2008, a total of 15,732,708
shares were repurchased for $750 million, excluding related fees.

Distributions,
Capital Contributions and Related Restrictions

(PPL)

In
February 2007, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly common stock dividend,
effective April 1, 2007, to 30.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.22 per
annum).  In February 2008, PPL announced an increase to its quarterly
common stock dividend, effective April 1, 2008, to 33.5 cents per share
(equivalent to $1.34 per annum).  Future dividends, declared at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future earnings,
cash flows, financial requirements and other factors.

As
previously discussed, neither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any
cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which
PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on the 2007 Series A Junior
Subordinated Notes due 2067.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The PPL
Montana Colstrip lease places certain restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to
declare dividends.  At this time, PPL believes that these covenants
will not limit PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's ability to operate as desired and
will not affect their ability to meet any of their cash
obligations.  Certain of PPL Global's international subsidiaries also
have financing arrangements that limit their ability to pay
dividends.  However, PPL does not, at this time, expect that any of
such limitations would significantly impact PPL's or PPL Energy Supply's ability
to meet their cash obligations.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

During
2007, PPL Energy Supply distributed $1.5 billion to its parent company, PPL
Energy Funding, and received cash capital contributions of $700
million.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric's 2001 Senior Secured Bond Indenture restricts dividend payments on its
common stock in the event that PPL Electric fails to meet interest coverage
ratios or fails to comply with certain requirements included in its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws to maintain its separateness from PPL and PPL's other
subsidiaries.  PPL Electric does not, at this time, expect that any of
such limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare
dividends.

As
discussed in Note 7, PPL Electric may not pay dividends on its common stock,
except in certain circumstances, unless full dividends have been paid on the
Preference Shares for the then-current dividend period.  The quarterly
dividend rate for PPL Electric's Preference Shares is $1.5625 per
share.  PPL Electric has declared and paid dividends on its
outstanding Preference Shares since issuance.  Dividends on the
Preference Shares are not cumulative and future dividends, declared at the
discretion of PPL Electric's Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future
earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors.

(PPL
Electric)

During
2007, PPL Electric paid common stock dividends of $119 million to
PPL.

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
continuously evaluates strategic options for its business segments and, from
time to time, PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in negotiations with third
parties regarding acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets, joint
ventures and development projects, which may or may not result in definitive
agreements.  Any such transactions may impact future financial
results.

Domestic

Sales

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

In 2004,
PPL Maine entered into an agreement with a coalition of government agencies and
private groups to sell three of its nine hydroelectric dams in
Maine.  Under the agreement, a non-profit organization designated by
the coalition would have a five-year option to purchase the dams for $25
million, and PPL Maine would receive rights to increase energy output at its
other hydroelectric dams in Maine.  The coalition has announced plans
to remove or bypass the dams subject to the agreement in order to restore runs
of Atlantic salmon and other migratory fish to the Penobscot
River.  The agreement requires several approvals by the
FERC.  Certain of these regulatory approvals have been obtained, but
PPL cannot predict whether or when all of them will be obtained.

License
Renewals

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

In 2006,
PPL Susquehanna applied to the NRC for 20-year license renewals for Units 1 and
2 of the nuclear power plant.  The license renewals for each of the
Susquehanna units would extend their expiration dates from 2022 to 2042 for Unit
1 and from 2024 to 2044 for Unit 2.  PPL cannot predict whether or
when NRC approval will be obtained.

In
December 2007, the FERC renewed PPL Montana's operating license at the Mystic
Lake Project.  This license will allow PPL Montana to produce power
through 2049.

Development

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
January 2007, the NRC accepted for review the PPL Susquehanna request to
increase the amount of electricity the Susquehanna nuclear plant can
generate.  The total expected capacity increase is 159 MW, of
which PPL Susquehanna's share would be 143 MW.  PPL Susquehanna's
share of the expected capital cost of this project is $287
million.  PPL Susquehanna received NRC approval in January
2008.  PPL expects the units to operate at the higher power levels
after the refueling outages in 2008 and 2010 for Unit 1 and in 2009 for Unit
2.

In
December 2007, PPL announced that a subsidiary will ask the NRC to approve a
COLA for a nuclear generating unit adjacent to the Susquehanna
plant.  NRC acceptance of the COLA by December 2008 would meet the
first requirement to qualify for federal production tax credits and loan
guarantees, as provided under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Requests
have also been filed with PJM for transmission feasibility and system impact
studies.  PPL has contracted with an affiliate of UniStar Nuclear LLC,
a joint venture between Constellation Energy Group, Inc. and AREVA NP, Inc.
(AREVA), to prepare the application.  The facility for which the
application will be submitted will be based on the U.S. Evolutionary Power
Reactor design developed by AREVA's parent.  PPL is
currently authorized to spend approximately $90 million on the COLA,
most of which would be incurred by the end of 2008.  PPL has made no
decision to proceed with development and construction of another nuclear unit
and expects that such decision could take as long as four years given an
anticipated lengthy approval process.  These cost estimates do not
reflect any construction expenditures, nor do they represent a commitment to
build.  Additionally, PPL has announced that it would likely only
proceed to construction in a joint-venture arrangement.  Through
December 31, 2007, $14 million of costs associated with the licensing effort
were capitalized, as PPL deems it probable that upon receiving approval of the
COLA from the NRC, it would build the unit, sell the COLA rights to another
party or contribute the COLA to a joint venture.

In
December 2007, PPL asked the FERC for approval to expand the capacity of its
Holtwood hydroelectric plant by 125 MW.  The expansion project has an
expected capital cost of $364 million and would include significant improvements
to fish passage operations at the dam.  After federal, state and local
approvals are received, PPL plans to begin construction in 2009, with generation
operations scheduled to start in 2012.  PPL cannot predict whether or
when the regulatory approvals will be obtained.

PPL also
plans to redevelop the Rainbow hydroelectric facility, near Great Falls,
Montana, for a total plant capacity of 60 MW, at an expected capital cost of
$175 million.  The redevelopment is anticipated to increase generation
by 28 MW.  This planned expansion is subject to various regulatory
approvals and other conditions, and PPL cannot predict whether or when these
approvals will be obtained or the other conditions will be met.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In June
2007, PJM approved the construction of a new 130-mile, 500-kilovolt transmission
line between the Susquehanna substation in Pennsylvania and the Roseland
substation in New Jersey that has been identified as essential to long-term
reliability of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid.  PJM determined that
the line is needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur in the next
decade on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM
system.  PJM has directed PPL Electric to construct the portion of the
Susquehanna-Roseland line in Pennsylvania and has directed Public Service
Electric & Gas Company (PSE&G) to construct the portion of the line in
New Jersey.  The total cost of the project is currently estimated to
be approximately $1 billion, with PPL Electric's share estimated to be between
$300 million and $500 million.  PPL Electric's 2008 - 2012 capital
projections include approximately $320 million for the new transmission line,
which will require certain regulatory approvals.

In
December 2007, PPL Electric and PSE&G filed a joint petition for a
declaratory order with the FERC requesting approval of transmission rate
incentives for the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line.  The
companies requested:  (1) an additional 1.5% allowed rate of return on
equity; (2) recognition of construction work in progress in rate base; (3)
recovery of all costs if the project is cancelled; and (4) an additional 0.5%
allowed rate of return on equity for membership in PJM.  This filing
remains pending before the FERC, and PPL Electric cannot predict the
outcome.

Sale of Telecommunication
Operations

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In the
first quarter of 2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for the
transport operations of its domestic telecommunications subsidiary, which offers
fiber optic capacity to other telecommunications companies and enterprise
customers.  The operating results of this subsidiary are included in
the Supply segment.  The transport operations did not meet the
criteria for discontinued operations presentation on the Statement of Income
because there were not separate and distinguishable cash flows.  Due
to a combination of significant capital requirements for the telecommunication
operations and competing capital needs in PPL's core electricity supply and
delivery businesses, PPL decided to actively market these telecommunication
operations.  As a result, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a $31
million ($18 million after tax) impairment of the telecommunication assets based
on their estimated fair value.

In May
2007, PPL reached a definitive agreement to sell its telecommunication
operations.  In the second quarter of 2007, PPL and PPL Energy Supply
recorded an additional impairment of $3 million ($2 million after
tax).  In August 2007, PPL completed the sale of its telecommunication
operations and recorded an additional impairment of $5 million ($3 million after
tax).  The impairments are included in "Energy-related businesses"
expenses on the Statement of Income.  PPL realized net proceeds of $47
million from the sale.  As a result of the sale, $65 million of assets
(which primarily consisted of PP&E) and $18 million of liabilities were
removed from the Balance Sheet during 2007.

Sales

In 2005,
WPD effectively sold an equity investment by transferring substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership of the two subsidiaries that held the investment,
receiving $9 million (at then-current exchange rates).  The gain was
deferred until WPD's continuing involvement in the subsidiaries
ceased.  In July 2006, WPD ceased involvement with one
subsidiary.  At that time, PPL Global recognized a pre-tax gain of $5
million.  In December 2006, WPD ceased involvement with the other
subsidiary.  In the first quarter of 2007, due to the one-month lag in
foreign subsidiary reporting, PPL Global recognized the remaining pre-tax gain
of $5 million.  These gains are included in "Other Income - net" on
the Statements of Income.

In 2006,
PPL Global completed the sale of its minority interest in Aguaytia Energy, LLC,
a combined generating and natural gas facility in Peru.  PPL Global
received $15 million from the sale, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million,
which is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statement of
Income.

Other

In 2006,
WPD received legal notification citing one of its real estate investments as an
environmentally protected area, thus restricting planned
development.  An impairment assessment was performed based on a
third-party appraisal.  As a result, PPL Global recorded an impairment
charge of $8 million ($6 million after tax), which is included in "Other Income
- - net" on the Statement of Income.

In 2000,
WPD acquired Hyder.  Subsequently, WPD sold the majority of Hyder's
non-electricity delivery businesses and placed the remaining companies in
liquidation.  In 2006, WPD received $28 million in proceeds as
distributions related to the planned ongoing liquidation of the remaining
non-electricity delivery businesses, of which $27 million was credited to
income.  WPD received further distributions of $6 million, which are
included in the 2007 financial results.  These distributions are
included in "Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income.  The
Hyder non-electricity delivery businesses are substantially
liquidated.  WPD expects to receive further liquidation distributions
in 2008 of up to approximately $3 million.  WPD continues to operate
the former Hyder electricity delivery business, now WPD (South
Wales).

Discontinued Operations

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Sale
of Latin American Businesses

In March
2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for its Latin American
businesses and announced its intention to sell its regulated electricity
delivery businesses in Chile, El Salvador and Bolivia, which were included in
the International Delivery segment.

In April
2007, PPL agreed to sell its Bolivian businesses to a group organized by local
management and employees of the companies.  As a result, in 2007, PPL
recorded impairments totaling $37 million, or $20 million after tax, to reflect
the estimated fair value of the businesses at the date the agreement was
reached.  This sale was completed in July 2007.

In May
2007, PPL completed the sale of its El Salvadoran business for $180 million in
cash.  PPL recorded a gain of $94 million, or $89 million after tax,
as a result of the sale.

In
November 2007, PPL completed the sale of its Chilean business for $660 million
in cash.  PPL recorded a gain of $306 million, or $197 million after
tax, as a result of the sale.

As a
result of these sales, $835 million of assets, which include $475 million of
PP&E and $185 million of current assets, and $425 million of liabilities and
related minority interest were removed from the Balance Sheet during
2007.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," the results of operations for the years 2005 through 2007
have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statements of
Income.  Following are the components of Discontinued Operations on
the Statements of Income related to PPL's Latin American regulated electricity
delivery businesses.

      taxes pursuant to APB Opinion No. 23, "Accounting for Income Taxes-Special
      Areas."

Sale
of Interest in Griffith Plant

In June
2006, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, which is included in the Supply
segment, sold its 50% ownership interest in the 600 MW Griffith power plant
located in Kingman, Arizona, for $110 million in cash, adjusted for the $5
million settlement of the steam turbine indemnifications in December
2006.  The book value of PPL's interest in the plant was $150 million
on the sale date.

Anticipated
Sale of Gas and Propane Businesses

In July
2007, PPL completed a review of strategic options for its natural gas
distribution and propane businesses and announced its intention to sell these
businesses, which are included in the Pennsylvania Delivery
segment.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," management assessed the carrying value of the assets and
liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2007.  Based on the

expectation
that the natural gas distribution and propane assets will be sold and based on
an assessment of prevailing market conditions, an impairment charge of $22
million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 and is included in
Discontinued Operations on the Statements of Income.  An associated
income tax benefit of $1 million was also recorded in Discontinued
Operations.

Management
is in the process of reviewing bid information and negotiating with interested
parties, and expects to complete a sale of these businesses during the second
half of 2008, following the execution of a sales agreement and the receipt of
all necessary regulatory approvals.

Proceeds
of the sale are expected to be used to invest in growth opportunities in PPL's
core electricity supply and delivery businesses and/or for the repurchase of
securities, including PPL common stock.

In
accordance with SFAS 144, the results of operations for the years 2005 through
2007 have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statements of
Income.  At December 31, 2007, the assets and liabilities are
classified as held for sale on the Balance Sheet.

      included in âIncome tax expense.â

(b)

As
      a result of classifying the natural gas distribution and propane
      businesses as Discontinued Operations and in accordance with EITF 93-17,
      "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent Company's Excess Tax
      Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary That Is Accounted for as a Discontinued
      Operation," in 2007, PPL recorded a deferred income tax liability and a
      corresponding charge of $23 million related to its excess of financial
      reporting basis over outside tax basis in the investment in these
      businesses.

The major
classes of "Assets held for sale" and "Liabilities held for sale" on the Balance
Sheet at December 31, 2007, were as follows (corresponding amounts at December

Leases

Colstrip
Generating Plant

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2007, PPL continued to participate in a significant sale/leaseback
transaction.  In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the
Colstrip generating plants to owner lessors who are leasing a 50% interest in
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3 back to PPL Montana under
four 36-year non-cancelable leases.  This transaction is accounted for
as an operating lease in accordance with current accounting pronouncements
related to sale/leaseback arrangements.  These leases provide two
renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation
assets.  PPL Montana currently amortizes material leasehold
improvements over no more than the remaining life of the original
leases.  PPL Montana is required to pay all expenses associated with
the operations of the generation units.  The leases place certain
restrictions on PPL Montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and
declare dividends and require PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios
related to cash flow and net worth.  There are no residual value
guarantees in these leases.  However, upon an event of default or an
event of loss, PPL Montana could be required to pay a termination value of
amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor
notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment and anticipated return
on investment.  The events of default include payment defaults,
breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness of
PPL Montana, change in control of PPL Montana and certain bankruptcy
events.  The termination value was estimated to be $683 million at
December 31, 2007.

Other
Leases

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
September 2006, PPL's subsidiaries terminated the master lease agreements under
which they leased equipment, such as vehicles, computers and office
equipment.  In addition, PPL and its subsidiaries purchased the
equipment from the lessors at a negotiated price.  Prior to the
buyout, PPL subsidiaries had been directly charged or allocated a portion of the
rental expense related to the assets they utilized.  In connection
with the buyout, ownership of the purchased equipment was reviewed and
attributed to the subsidiaries based on usage of the equipment.  As a
result, "Property, Plant and Equipment" increased on the Balance Sheet by $107
million for PPL, $29 million for PPL Energy Supply and $52 million for PPL
Electric.

The
following rent expense for all operating leases, including the Colstrip
generating plant; equipment under the master lease agreements prior to September
2006; office space; land; buildings; and other equipment, was primarily included
in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

In
connection with the acquisition of certain fiber optic network assets in 2003, a
subsidiary of PPL Telcom, LLC assumed a capital lease obligation through
2020.  The balance outstanding at December 31, 2006, was $10
million.  In connection with the sale of the domestic
telecommunication operations, this lease was assumed in 2007 by the
buyer.  See Note 9 for additional information on the sale of these
operations.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply no longer have substantial
capital lease obligations.

(PPL

Due to
the termination of the master lease agreements in 2006 mentioned above, PPL
Electric has no substantial future minimum rental payments.

Stock-Based Compensation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Effective
January 1, 2006, PPL and its subsidiaries adopted SFAS 123 (revised 2004),
"Share-Based Payment," which is known as SFAS 123(R), using the modified
prospective application transition method.  The adoption of SFAS
123(R) did not have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries, since PPL
and its subsidiaries adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation, as described by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," effective January 1, 2003.

Under the
PPL Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) and the Incentive Compensation Plan for
Key Employees (ICPKE) (together, the Plans), restricted shares of PPL common
stock, restricted stock units and stock options may be granted to officers and
other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and other affiliated
companies.  Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation
Governance and Nominating Committee (CGNC) of the PPL Board of Directors, in the
case of the ICP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council (CLC), in the case
of the ICPKE.  The ICP limits the total number of awards that may be
granted under it after April 23, 1999, to 15,769,430 awards, or 5% of the
total shares of PPL common stock that were outstanding at April 23,
1999.  The ICPKE limits the total number of awards that may be granted
under it after April 25, 2003, to 16,573,608 awards, or 5% of the total shares
of PPL common stock that were outstanding at January 1, 2003, reduced by
outstanding awards of 2,373,812, for which PPL common stock was not yet issued
as of April 25, 2003, resulting in a limit of 14,199,796.  In
addition, each Plan limits the number of shares available for awards in any
calendar year to 2% of the outstanding common stock of PPL on the first day of
such calendar year.  The maximum number of options that can be awarded
under each Plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is three
million shares.  Any portion of these options that has not been
granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year.  If any
award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the
shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again available for
grant.  Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form of
authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL
or PPL common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases)
in accordance with applicable securities laws.

Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted
shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend
rights.  Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for
key executives and have vesting periods as determined by the CGNC in the case of
the ICP, and the CLC in the case of the ICPKE, that range from seven to 25
years.  In addition, the shares are subject to forfeiture or
accelerated payout under Plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability
and death of employees.  Restricted shares vest fully if control of
PPL changes, as defined by the plans.

The Plans
allow for the grant of restricted stock units.  Restricted stock units
are awards based on the fair market value of PPL common stock.  Actual
PPL common shares will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally
three years, as determined by the CGNC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in
the case of the ICPKE.  Recipients of restricted stock units may also
be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the
restriction period or until the award is forfeited.  Restricted stock
units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the Plan provisions
for termination, retirement, disability and death of
employees.  Restricted stock units vest fully if control of PPL
changes, as defined by the Plans.

Options

Under the
Plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share
not less than the fair market value of PPL's common stock on the date of
grant.  The options are exercisable beginning one year after the date
of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary, in
installments as determined by the CGNC in the case of the ICP, and the CLC in
the case of the ICPKE.  Options outstanding at December 31, 2007,
become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year period from the date
of grant.  The CGNC and CLC have discretion to accelerate the
exercisability of the options, except that the exercisability of an option
issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless the individual remains
employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the date of
grant.  All options expire no later than ten years from the grant
date.  The options become exercisable immediately if control of PPL
changes, as defined by the Plans.

Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Volatility over the expected term
of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may
need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL's
volatility in those prior periods.  Management's expectations for
future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL's business model and
other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data
to determine the final volatility assumption.

The
income tax benefit PPL realized from stock-based arrangements for 2007 was $25
million, with $19 million attributed to stock option exercises.

Directors Stock Units

(PPL)

Under the
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, a mandatory amount of the cash retainers
of the members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of PPL is
deferred into stock units.  Such deferred stock units represent the
number of shares of PPL's common stock to which the board members are entitled
after they cease serving as a member of the Board of Directors.  Board
members also are entitled to defer any or all of their fees and cash retainers
that are not part of the mandatory deferral into stock units.  The
stock unit accounts of each board member are increased based on dividends paid
or other distributions on PPL's common stock.  There were 330,156 such
stock units outstanding at December 31, 2007, which are accounted for as
liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings based on
PPL's common stock price at the end of each reporting period.

Compensation
costs for directors stock units were $5 million, $2 million and $1 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005.  Income tax benefits related to these costs were
$2 million, $1 million and $1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Awards
paid during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were insignificant.

Stock
Appreciation Rights

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

WPD uses
stock appreciation rights to compensate senior management
employees.  Stock appreciation rights are granted with a reference
price to PPL's common stock at the date of grant.  These awards vest
over a three-year period and have a 10-year term, during which time employees
are entitled to receive a cash payment of any appreciation in the price of PPL's
common stock over the grant date fair value.  At December 31,
2007, there were 340,032 stock appreciation rights outstanding, which are
accounted for as liabilities with changes in fair value recognized currently in
earnings based on updated Black-Scholes calculations.

Compensation
costs related to stock appreciation rights in 2007 were $5 million, with related
income tax benefits of $2 million.  Compensation costs for 2006 and
2005 were insignificant.

Awards
paid in 2007 totaled $2 million, and were insignificant for 2006 and
2005.

Retirement and Postemployment
Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Defined
Benefits

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit plans.

The
majority of PPL's domestic employees are eligible for pension benefits under
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of
service and final average pay, as defined by the plans.  Employees of
PPL Montana are eligible for pension benefits under a cash balance pension plan
and employees of certain of PPL's mechanical contracting companies are eligible
for benefits under multi-employer plans sponsored by various
unions.  The employees of PPL's U.K. subsidiary, WPD, are eligible for
benefits from one pension scheme with benefits based on length of service and
final average pay.

PPL and
certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to
directors, executives and other key management employees through unfunded
nonqualified retirement plans.

The
majority of employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries will become eligible for
certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through
contributory plans.  Postretirement benefits under the PPL Retiree
Health Plan and PPL Gas Retiree Health Plan are paid from funded VEBA trusts
sponsored by the respective companies.  Postretirement benefits under
the PPL Montana Retiree Health Plan are paid from company assets.

The
following disclosures distinguish between domestic and international pension
plans.

(a)

The
      $5 million cost of termination benefits for 2005 was related to the WPD
      approved staff reduction plan as a result of the merger of its two control
      rooms, metering reorganization and other staff
      efficiencies.  Additional pension costs were recognized due to
      early retirement and pension enhancement provisions granted to the
      employees.

(b)

The
      $3 million cost of termination benefits for 2006 was related to the PPL
      Susquehanna approved staff reduction plan.  In addition,
      severance of $2 million was also recorded for a total charge of $5 million
      ($3 million after tax).

(c)

The
      $6 million domestic and $3 million international costs of termination
      benefits for 2007 were related primarily to the elimination of positions
      at PPL's Martins Creek plant due to the shutdown of two coal-fired units
      in September 2007, and the closing of WPD's meter test
      station.  In addition, severance of $4 million was also recorded
      for a total charge of $13 million ($9 million after
  tax).

The
estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
into net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal period are as

The
      $3 million international cost of termination benefits for 2007 was related
      to the closing of WPD's meter test station.  In addition,
      severance of $2 million was also recorded for a total charge of $5 million
      ($4 million after tax).

Prior
service costs of $6 million and actuarial losses of $19 million related to the
international pension plans are expected to be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal
period.

In
      addition to the specific plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL
      Generation subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus were also allocated $32 million
      of the costs of defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services, included
      in the total cost above, based on their participation in those
      plans.

(b)

PPL
      Electric does not directly sponsor any defined benefit
      plans.  PPL Electric is allocated a portion of the costs of
      defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services, based on its
      participation in those plans.

      result of the planned sale of that
business.

Information

Other
postretirement benefit plans with accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets had accumulated postretirement benefit obligations and
fair value of assets of $541 million and $291 million at December 31, 2007, and
$531 million and $289 million at December 31, 2006.

At both
December 31, 2007 and 2006, other postretirement benefit plans with accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations of $16 million and no fair value of
assets.

In
addition to the plans sponsored by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Generation
subsidiaries and PPL EnergyPlus are allocated a portion of the funded status and
costs of the defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services based on their
participation in those plans.  PPL Energy Supply's allocated share of
the funded status of the pension plans resulted in a deferred asset of $37
million and a liability of $20 million at December 31, 2007.  At
December 31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply had been allocated a $35 million liability
for these plans.  PPL Energy Supply's allocated share of other
postretirement benefits was a liability of $93 million at December 31,
2007, and a liability of $90 million at December 31, 2006.

PPL
Energy Supply's subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business make
contributions to various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans,
depending on an employee's status.  Contributions of $61 million, $48
million and $37 million were made in 2007, 2006 and 2005.  The change
in contributions from year to year was primarily the result of the changes in
the workforce at the mechanical contracting companies.  The
contribution rates have also increased from year to year.

(PPL
Electric)

Although
PPL Electric does not directly sponsor any defined benefit plans, it is
allocated a portion of the funded status and costs of plans sponsored by PPL
Services based on participation in those plans.  PPL Electric's
allocated share of the funded status of the pension plans resulted in a deferred
asset of $12 million and a liability of $4 million at December 31,
2007.  At December 31, 2006, PPL Electric had been allocated a $45
million liability for these plans.  The balance for PPL Electric's
allocated share of other postretirement benefits was a liability of $91 million
at December 31, 2007, and a liability of $88 million at December 31,
2006.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Electric had regulatory assets of $3 million relating to
the initial adoption of SFAS 106, which is being amortized and recovered in
rates, with a remaining life of five years.

PPL
Electric also maintains a liability for the cost of health care of retired
miners of former subsidiaries that had been engaged in coal mining, as required
by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.  PPL Electric
accounts for this liability under EITF 92-13, "Accounting for Estimated Payments
in Connection with the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of
1992."  PPL Electric's net liability was $35 million at
December 31, 2005.  In the third quarter of 2006, PPL Electric
was able to fully offset the net liability, calculated at that time, of $36
million, with excess Black Lung Trust assets as a result of the passage of the
Pension Protection Act of 2006.  At December 31, 2007, the net
liability continues to be fully offset with excess Black Lung Trust
assets.  See "Pension Protection Act of 2006" within this note for
further discussion.

The
domestic pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers and are
rebalanced as necessary to maintain the target asset allocation
ranges.  PPL's investment strategy with respect to the domestic
pension assets is to achieve a satisfactory risk-adjusted return on assets that,
in combination with PPL's funding policy and tolerance for return volatility,
will ensure that sufficient dollars are available to provide benefit
payments.

The
expected long-term rate of return for PPL's domestic pension plans considers the
plans' historical experience, but is primarily based on the plans' mix of assets
and expectations for long-term returns of those asset classes.

PPL's
investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations
is to fund the VEBA trusts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax
efficient manner utilizing a prudent mix of assets.  Based on the
current VEBA and postretirement plan structure, PPL targets an asset allocation
range of 50% to 60% equity and 40% to 50% debt, with any difference held in cash
as a result of contribution/investment timing and payment of postretirement
benefits.

The
expected long-term rate of return for PPL's other postretirement benefit plans
is based on

the
VEBA trusts' mix of assets and expectations for long-term returns of those asset
classes considering that a portion of those assets are taxable.

In
consultation with its investment advisor and with WPD, the group trustees of the
WPD Group of the ESPS have drawn up a Statement of Investment Principles to
comply with the requirements of U.K. legislation.

The group
trustees' primary investment objective is to maximize investment returns within
the constraint of avoiding excessive volatility in the funding
position.

The
expected rate of return for PPL and its subsidiaries' international pension
plans considers that a portfolio largely invested in equities would be expected
to achieve an average rate of return in excess of a portfolio largely invested
in long-term bonds.  The historical experience has been an excess
return of 2% to 4% per annum on average over the return on long-term
bonds.

Expected
Cash Flows - Domestic Defined Benefit Plans

(PPL)

There are
no contributions required for PPL's primary domestic pension plan or any of
PPL's other domestic subsidiary pension plans.  However, PPL's
domestic subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $17 million to their
pension plans in 2008 to ensure future compliance with minimum funding
requirements.

PPL
sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets
are segregated from corporate assets.  PPL expects to make
approximately $4 million of benefit payments under these plans in
2008.

PPL is
not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but
has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement
benefit costs recognized.  Continuation of this past practice would
cause PPL to contribute $42 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
2008.

The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid and the following federal subsidy payments
are expected to be received by the separate plan trusts.

Employee
Stock Ownership Plan

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL

PPL
sponsors a non-leveraged ESOP in which substantially all domestic employees,
excluding those of PPL Montana, PPL Gas Utilities and the mechanical
contractors, are enrolled on the first day of the month following eligible
employee status.  Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as
ordinary dividends by PPL.  Under existing income tax laws, PPL is
permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to
contribute the resulting tax savings (dividend-based contribution) to the
ESOP.

The
dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of PPL's common stock and is
expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal
income tax purposes.  Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to
eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares
held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants'
compensation.

Amounts
charged as compensation expense for ESOP contributions were $7 million, $7
million and $6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005.  These amounts were
offset by the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on PPL's
earnings.

ESOP
shares outstanding at December 31, 2007, were 7,984,554 or 2% of total common
shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations.

Postemployment
Benefits

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Certain
PPL subsidiaries provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled
employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased
employees.  PPL follows the guidance of SFAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," when accounting for these
benefits.  Postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were
not significant for 2007 and 2006.  Postemployment benefits charged to
operating expense for 2005 were $8 million for PPL, $4 million for PPL Energy
Supply and $2 million for PPL Electric, primarily due to an updated valuation
for Long-Term Disability benefits completed in 2005.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Prior to
the sale of certain of PPL Global subsidiaries, including Emel, DelSur, Elfec
and Integra, PPL Energy Supply provided limited non-pension benefits to all
employees.  All active employees were entitled to benefits in the
event of termination or retirement in accordance with government-sponsored
programs.  These plans generally obligated a company to pay one
month's salary per year of service to employees in the event of involuntary
termination.  Under certain plans, employees with five or more years
of service were entitled to this payment in the event of voluntary or
involuntary termination.

The
liabilities for these plans were accounted for under the guidance of EITF 88-1,
"Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for a Defined Benefit Pension Plan,"
using what is commonly referred to as the "shut down" method, where a company
records the undiscounted obligation as if it were payable at each balance sheet
date.  As of December 31, 2007, there were no recorded liabilities, as
PPL had completed the sale of all Latin American subsidiaries.  The
combined liabilities for these plans at December 31, 2006, was $11 million, and
is recorded in "Deferred Credits and Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" on the
Balance Sheets.

Pension
Protection Act of 2006

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

On August
17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was signed by President
Bush.  The Act's changes, which will become effective in 2008, cover
current pension plan legislation and funding rules for defined benefit pension
plans.  Based on the current funded status of PPL's defined benefit
pension plans, the Act is not expected to have a significant impact on the
future funding of these plans or have a significant financial impact on PPL, PPL
Energy Supply or PPL Electric in regard to these plans.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

The Act
does contain a provision that provides for excess assets held exclusively in
Black Lung Trust funds to be used to pay for health benefits other than black
lung disease for retired coal miners.  Prior to recognition of this
provision of the Act, PPL Electric had a net liability of $36 million for the
medical costs of retirees of a PPL subsidiary represented by the United Mine
Workers of America (UMWA).  This subsidiary had a Black Lung Trust
that was significantly overfunded.  As a result of the Act and the
ability to use the excess Black Lung Trust assets to make future benefit
payments for the UMWA retiree medical costs, PPL Electric was able to fully
offset the UMWA retiree medical liability on its Balance Sheet and record a
one-time credit to PPL's and PPL Electric's "Other operation and maintenance"
expense of $21 million (net of tax expense of $15 million).

Jointly-Owned
Facilities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, subsidiaries of PPL and PPL Energy Supply owned
interests in the facilities listed below.  The Balance Sheets of PPL
and PPL Energy Supply include the amounts noted in the following
table.

Each PPL
Generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the
facility.  Each receives a portion of the total output of the
generating stations equal to its percentage ownership.  The share of
fuel and other operating costs associated with the stations is included in the
corresponding operating expenses on the Statements of Income.

In
addition to the interests mentioned above, PPL Montana is the operator of the
jointly-owned, coal-fired generating units comprising the Colstrip steam
generation facility.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, PPL Montana had a
50% leasehold interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% leasehold interest in
Colstrip Unit 3 under operating leases.  See Note 11 for additional
information.

PPL
Montana's share of direct expenses associated with the operation and maintenance
of these facilities is included in the corresponding operating expenses on the
Statements of Income.  Each joint-owner in these facilities provides
its own financing.  As operator of all Colstrip Units, PPL Montana
invoices each joint-owner for its respective portion of the direct
expenses.  The amount due from joint-owners was $10 million and $7
million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

At
December 31, 2007, NorthWestern owned a 30% leasehold interest in Colstrip Unit
4.  PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement to govern
each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3
and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating
and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to
Colstrip Unit 3 or 4.  However, each party is responsible for its own
fuel-related costs.

Commitments and Contingencies

Energy
Purchases, Energy Sales and Other Commitments

Energy Purchase
Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into long-term purchase contracts to supply the fuel
requirements for generation facilities.  These contracts include
commitments to purchase coal, emission allowances, natural gas, oil and nuclear
fuel and extend for terms through 2019.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply
also enter into long-term contracts for the storage and transportation of
natural gas which extend through 2014 and 2032.  Additionally, PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power that
extend for terms through 2017, excluding long-term power purchase agreements for
full output of two wind farms.  These wind farm contracts extend for
terms through 2027.

As part
of the purchase of generation assets from Montana Power, PPL Montana assumed a
power purchase agreement, which was still in effect at December 31,
2007.  In accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, PPL Montana
recorded a liability of $58 million as the estimated fair value of the agreement
at the acquisition date.  The liability is being reduced over the term
of the agreement, through 2010, as an adjustment to "Energy purchases" on the
Statements of Income.  The unamortized balance of the liability
related to the agreement at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $34 million and $42
million, of which $24 million and $34 million is included in "Deferred Credits
and Other Noncurrent Liabilities - Other" and $10 million and $8 million is
included in "Current Liabilities - Other" on the Balance Sheets.

In 1998,
PPL Electric recorded a loss accrual for above-market contracts with NUGs of
$879 million, due to the deregulation of its generation
business.  Effective January 1999, PPL Electric began reducing this
liability as an offset to "Energy purchases" on the Statements of
Income.  This reduction is based on the estimated timing of the
purchases from the NUGs and projected market prices for this
generation.  The final NUG contract expires in 2014.  In
connection with the corporate realignment in 2000, the remaining balance of this
liability was transferred to PPL EnergyPlus.  At December 31, 2007 and
2006, the remaining liability associated with the above-market NUG contracts was
$71 million and $136 million.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

In July
2007, PPL Electric conducted the first of six competitive solicitations to
purchase electricity generation supply in 2010, after its existing PLR contract
expires, for customers who do not choose a competitive
supplier.  Competitive bids were solicited for 850 MW of generation
supply, or one-sixth of PPL Electric's expected supply requirements for these
customers in 2010.  For this solicitation, the average generation
supply price for 2010, including Pennsylvania gross receipts tax and an
adjustment for line losses, is $101.77 per MWh for residential customers and
$105.11 per MWh for small commercial and small industrial
customers.

In
October 2007, PPL Electric conducted the second of six competitive solicitations
to purchase electricity generation supply in 2010.  Competitive bids
were solicited for an additional 850 MW of generation supply.  For
this solicitation, the average generation supply price for 2010, including
Pennsylvania gross receipts tax and an adjustment for line losses, is $105.08
per MWh for residential customers and $105.75 per MWh for small commercial and
small industrial customers.

The third
competitive solicitation will be held in March 2008.

EnergyPlus and the bids awarded to PPL EnergyPlus under PPL Electric's Supply
Master Agreement for 2010.

Energy Sales
Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
connection with its marketing activities or associated with certain of its power
plants, PPL Energy Supply enters into long-term power sales contracts that
extend for terms through 2017.  All long-term contracts were executed
at prices that approximated market price at the time of execution.

PPL
Energy Supply has entered into full requirements and retail contracts with
various counterparties.  These contracts extend through
2014.  Under these contracts, if PPL Energy Supply's credit rating
falls below investment grade or PPL Energy Supply's contract exposure exceeds
the established credit limit for the contract, then the counterparty has the
right to request collateral from PPL Energy Supply.  At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, an insignificant amount of collateral was
posted under these contracts.

As a
result of PPL Electric's first competitive solicitation process in July 2007,
PPL EnergyPlus was one of the successful bidders for 671 MW, with unrelated
parties providing the remaining solicited generation supply.

PPL Montana Hydroelectric
License Commitments

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
Montana has 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed by
the FERC pursuant to the Federal Power Act under long-term
licenses.  Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Federal Power Act, the FERC
approved the transfer from Montana Power to PPL Montana of all pertinent
licenses and any amendments in connection with the Montana Asset Purchase
Agreement.

The Kerr
Dam Project license was jointly issued by the FERC to Montana Power and the
Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation in 1985, and
required Montana Power to hold and operate the project for 30
years.  The license required Montana Power, and subsequently PPL
Montana as a result of the purchase of the Kerr Dam from Montana Power, to
continue to implement a plan to mitigate the impact of the Kerr Dam on fish,
wildlife and the habitat.  Under this arrangement, PPL Montana has a
remaining commitment to spend $16 million between 2008 and 2015, in addition to
the annual rental it pays to the tribes.  Between 2015 and 2025, the
tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project for the
remainder of the license term of 2035.

PPL
Montana entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with state, federal
and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the FERC renewal license
for the nine dams for the Missouri-Madison project.  The MOUs require
PPL Montana to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish,
wildlife and the habitat, and to increase recreational
opportunities.  The MOUs were created to maximize collaboration
between the parties and enhance the possibility for matching funds from relevant
federal agencies.  Under this arrangement, PPL Montana has a remaining
commitment to spend $44 million between 2008 and 2040.

Settlement of Enron Receivables

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply had significant specific reserves related to receivables from
Enron Corporation (Enron), which filed for bankruptcy in 2001.  The
Enron reserves were for claims against Enron North America and Enron Power
Marketing (Enron Subsidiaries), and against Enron for certain guarantees of the
Enron Subsidiaries' (Enron Corporation Guarantees).

In March
2006, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved agreements between Enron and PPL Energy
Supply that settled litigation between PPL Energy Supply and Enron regarding the
validity and enforceability of the Enron Corporation Guarantees.  As a
result of the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the settlement of the Enron
Corporation Guarantees litigation, an assessment of current market price quotes
for the purchase of Enron claims and the subsequent sale of its Enron claims to
an independent third party, PPL Energy Supply reduced the associated allowance
for doubtful accounts in 2006.  The effect of this change was to
increase income from continuing operations and net income by $11 million ($0.03
per share, basic and diluted, for PPL).  See "Guarantees and Other
Assurances" for information on PPL Energy Supply's potential repayment
obligation related to the sale.

Legal
Matters

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the
ordinary course of business.  PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict
the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material
liabilities.

Montana Power Shareholders'
Litigation

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In August
2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders of
Montana Power against Montana Power, the directors of Montana Power, certain
advisors and consultants of Montana Power, and PPL Montana.  The
plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Montana Power was required to, and
did not, obtain shareholder approval of the sale of Montana Power's generation
assets to PPL Montana in 1999, and that the sale "was null and void ab
initio."  Among the remedies that the plaintiffs are seeking is the
establishment of a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation
assets and all profits earned by PPL Montana from the generation assets, plus
interest on the amounts subject to the trust.  This lawsuit has been
pending in the U.S. District Court of Montana, Butte Division, and the judge has
placed this proceeding on hold pending the outcome of certain motions currently
before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the resolution of
which may impact this proceeding.  The judge in this case has not yet
established a schedule to resume the proceeding.  In September 2007,
certain plaintiffs proposed a settlement of certain claims not involving PPL and
proposed a status conference to discuss their proposal.  The judge
held the status conference in January 2008 and rejected the proposed
settlement.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of
this matter.

Montana Hydroelectric
Litigation

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation (Avista) and PacifiCorp commenced
an action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court
seeking a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for their
hydropower facilities' use and occupancy of streambeds in Montana can be
collected by the State of Montana.  This request for declaratory
judgment from the Montana state court was brought following the dismissal of the
State of Montana's federal lawsuit seeking such payments or compensation in the
U.S. District Court of Montana, Missoula Division, on jurisdictional
grounds.  The State's federal lawsuit was founded on allegations that
the beds of Montana's navigable rivers became state-owned trust property upon
Montana's admission to statehood, and that the use of them for placement of dam
structures, affiliated structures and reservoirs should, under a 1931 regulatory
scheme enacted after all but one of the dams in question were constructed,
trigger lease payments for use of land beneath.  In July 2006, the
Montana state court approved a stipulation by the State of Montana that it is
not seeking lease payments or other compensation from PPL Montana for the period
prior to PPL Montana's acquisition of the hydroelectric facilities in December
1999.

In
October 2007, Avista announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement
in its separate proceeding with the State of Montana providing, in pertinent
part, that Avista would make prospective lease payments of $4 million per year
for use of the State's streambeds (adjusted annually for inflation and subject
to other future adjustments).  Under the settlement agreement, this
prospective annual payment by Avista resolves the State's claims for both past
and future rent.

In the
October 2007 trial of this matter, the State of Montana asserted that PPL
Montana should make a prospective lease payment for use of the State's
streambeds of $6 million per year (adjusted annually for inflation) and a
retroactive payment for the 2000-2006 period (including interest) of $41
million.

PPL
Montana continues to vigorously defend its position in this
proceeding.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict when a final
decision may be rendered in this proceeding or the ultimate
outcome.

Regulatory
Issues

California ISO and Western
Markets

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Through
its subsidiaries, PPL made $18 million of sales to the California ISO during the
period from October 2000 through June 2001, of which $17 million has not been
paid to PPL subsidiaries.  Given the myriad of electricity supply
problems presently faced by the California electric utilities and the California
ISO, PPL cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment.  At
December 31, 2007, PPL continues to be fully reserved for underrecoveries of
payments for these sales.

Regulatory
proceedings arising out of the California electricity supply situation have been
filed at the FERC.  The FERC has determined that all sellers of energy
into markets operated by the California ISO and the California Power Exchange,
including PPL Montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period
beginning October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, but the FERC has not yet ruled
on the exact amounts that the sellers, including PPL Montana, would be required
to refund.  In decisions in September 2004 and August 2006, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the FERC had the additional
legal authority to order refunds for periods prior to October 2, 2000, and
ordered the FERC to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to grant
such additional refunds.  As part of its August 2006 decision, the
Court stayed the time to petition for rehearing of the decision and its mandate
to the FERC in order to allow the parties time to conduct settlement
discussions.

In June
2003, the FERC took several actions as a result of a number of related
investigations.  The FERC terminated proceedings to consider whether
to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the Pacific Northwest,
including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period December 2000 through
June 2001.  In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed the FERC's decision and ordered the FERC to consider additional
evidence.  The FERC also commenced additional investigations relating
to "gaming" and bidding practices during 2000 and 2001, but neither PPL
EnergyPlus nor PPL Montana believes it is a subject of these
investigations.

Litigation
arising out of the California electricity supply situation has been filed in
California courts against sellers of energy to the California
ISO.  The plaintiffs and intervenors in these legal proceedings
allege, among other things, abuse of market power, manipulation of market
prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws, and seek
other relief, including treble damages and attorneys' fees.  While
PPL's subsidiaries have not been named by the plaintiffs in these legal
proceedings, one defendant in a consolidated court proceeding named PPL Montana
in its cross-complaint; this defendant denied any unlawful conduct but asserted
that, if it is found liable, the other generators and power marketers, including
PPL Montana, caused, contributed to and/or participated in the plaintiffs'
alleged losses.  In July 2006, the Court dismissed this case as the
result of a settlement under which PPL Montana was not required to make any
payments or provide any compensation.

In
February 2004, the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated a limited
investigation of the Montana retail electricity market for the years 2000 and
2001, focusing on how that market was affected by transactions involving the
possible manipulation of the electricity grid in the western U.S.  The
investigation includes all public utilities and licensed electricity suppliers
in Montana, including PPL Montana, as well as other entities that may possess
relevant information.  In June 2004, the Montana Attorney General
served PPL Montana and more than 20 other companies with subpoenas requesting
documents, and PPL Montana has provided responsive documents to the Montana
Attorney General.

While PPL
and its subsidiaries believe that they have not engaged in any improper trading
or marketing practices affecting the California and western markets, PPL cannot
predict the outcome of the above-described investigations, lawsuits and
proceedings or whether any PPL subsidiaries will be the target of any additional
governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund
proceedings.

PJM
Capacity Litigation

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

In
December 2002, PPL was served with a complaint against PPL, PPL EnergyPlus and
PPL Electric filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania by a group of 14 Pennsylvania boroughs that apparently alleged,
among other things, violations of the federal antitrust laws in connection with
the pricing of installed capacity in the PJM daily market during the first
quarter of 2001 and certain breach of contract claims.  These boroughs
were wholesale customers of PPL Electric.  In April 2006, the Court
dismissed all of the federal antitrust claims and all of the breach of contract
claims except for one breach of contract claim by one of the
boroughs.  In May 2007, the Court withdrew its April 2006 decision as
to one of the federal antitrust claims, but directed additional briefing on
alternative grounds for dismissal of that claim.  In September 2007,
the Court dismissed the one remaining federal antitrust claim.  Such
dismissals are subject to the plaintiffs' right to appeal.  PPL cannot
predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Each of
the U.S. Department of Justice - Antitrust Division, the FERC and the
Pennsylvania Attorney General conducted investigations regarding PPL's PJM
capacity market transactions in early 2001 and did not find any reason to take
action against PPL.

New
England Investigation

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

In
January 2004, PPL became aware of an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney
General and the FERC's Office of Market Oversight and Investigation (OMOI)
regarding allegations that natural gas-fired generators located in New England
illegally sold natural gas instead of generating electricity during the week of
January 12, 2004.  PPL has responded to a data request of OMOI that
indicated that PPL was not under suspicion of a regulatory violation, but that
OMOI was conducting an initial investigation.  PPL also has responded
to data requests of ISO New England and data requests served by subpoena from
the Connecticut Attorney General.  Both OMOI and ISO New England have
issued preliminary reports finding no regulatory or other violations concerning
these matters.  While PPL does not believe that it committed any
regulatory or other violations concerning the subject matter of these
investigations, PPL cannot predict the outcome of these
investigations.

PJM
Billing

(PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In
December 2004, Exelon Corporation, on behalf of its subsidiary, PECO Energy,
Inc. (PECO), filed a complaint against PJM and PPL Electric with the FERC
alleging that PJM had overcharged PECO from April 1998 through May 2003 as a
result of an error by PJM in the State Estimator Model used in connection with
billing all PJM customers for certain transmission, spot market energy and
ancillary services charges.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that
PJM mistakenly identified PPL Electric's Elroy substation transformer as
belonging to PECO and that, as a consequence, during times of congestion, PECO's
bills for transmission congestion from PJM erroneously reflected energy that PPL
Electric took from the Elroy substation and used to serve PPL Electric's
load.  The complaint requested the FERC, among other things, to direct
PPL Electric to refund to PJM $39 million, plus interest of $8 million, and for
PJM to refund these same amounts to PECO.

In April
2005, the FERC determined that PECO was entitled to reimbursement for the
transmission congestion charges that PECO asserted PJM erroneously billed to it
at the Elroy substation.  The FERC set for additional proceedings
before a judge the determination of the amount of the overcharge to PECO and
which PJM market participants were undercharged.  PPL Electric
recognized an after-tax charge of $27 million in the first quarter of 2005 for a
loss contingency related to this matter.  The pre-tax accrual was $47
million, with $39 million included in "Energy purchases" on the Statement of
Income, and $8 million in "Interest Expense."

In
December 2006, PPL Electric and Exelon filed with the FERC, pursuant to a
November 2006 order, a modified offer of settlement (Compliance
Filing).  Under the Compliance Filing, PPL Electric would make a
single payment through its monthly PJM bill of $38 million, plus interest
through the date of payment, and PJM would include a single credit for this
amount in PECO's monthly PJM bill.  Through December 31, 2006, the
estimated interest on this payment was $4 million, for a total PPL Electric
payment of $42 million.  Based on the Compliance Filing, PPL and PPL
Electric reduced the recorded loss accrual by $5 million at December 31,
2006.

PPL
determined that PPL Electric was responsible for the claims prior to July 1,
2000 (totaling $12 million), and that PPL EnergyPlus was responsible for the
claims subsequent to that date (totaling $30 million).  Accordingly,
at December 31, 2006, PPL Electric recorded a receivable from PPL EnergyPlus of
$30 million, reduced the recorded liability to PJM by $5 million, and recorded
credits to expense of $35 million on the Statement of Income ($28 million to
"Energy purchases" and $7 million to "Interest Expense").  At December
31, 2006, PPL Energy Supply recorded a loss of $30 million ($27 million of
"Energy purchases" and $3 million of "Interest Expense") and a corresponding
payable to PPL Electric.

In March
2007, the FERC entered an order approving the Compliance Filing.  In
April 2007, PPL Electric paid PJM the full settlement amount of $43 million,
including additional interest of $1 million recorded during the three months
ended March 31, 2007.  PPL Energy Supply paid PPL Electric for its
portion of the settlement.  This proceeding is now
terminated.

FERC Market-Based Rate
Authority

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
December 1998, the FERC issued an order authorizing PPL EnergyPlus to make
wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based
rates.  In that order, the FERC directed PPL EnergyPlus to file an
updated market analysis within three years of the date of the order, and every
three years thereafter.  Market-based rate filings with the FERC were
made in November 2004 by PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of
PPL Generation's subsidiaries.  These filings consisted of a Western
market-based rate filing for PPL Montana and an Eastern market-based rate filing
for most of the other PPL subsidiaries in the PJM region.

In
September 2005, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the Eastern
market-based rate filing, subject to PPL subsidiaries making a compliance filing
providing further support that they cannot erect other non-transmission barriers
to entry into the generation market.  The PPL subsidiaries made this
compliance filing in October 2005, which the FERC accepted.

In May
2006, the FERC issued an order rejecting the claims of the various parties in
the proceeding regarding PPL's Western market-based rate filing and granting PPL
Montana market-based rate authority in NorthWestern's control
area.  In July 2007, the FERC denied two outstanding requests for
rehearing of the FERC order.  Subsequently, various parties in this
proceeding filed appeals of the FERC order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit.  In September 2007, a party also filed a complaint
with the FERC seeking additional refunds in the event that the U.S. Court of
Appeals overturns or reverses the FERC order.  While PPL Montana
continues to believe that it does not have market power in NorthWestern's
control area and that it has no obligations to make additional sales of power to
NorthWestern regardless of the outcome of this proceeding, it cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings.

In
January 2008, pursuant to the schedule established by FERC orders, PPL's
subsidiaries made another market-based rate renewal filing for all Eastern
subsidiaries in the PJM, New England and New York regions, including PPL
Electric, PPL EnergyPlus and most of PPL Generation's subsidiaries.

Currently,
if a seller is granted market-based rate authority by the FERC, it may enter
into power contracts during the time period for which such authority has been
granted.  If the FERC determines that the market is not workably
competitive or the seller possesses market power or is not charging "just and
reasonable" rates, the FERC institutes prospective action.  Any
contracts entered into pursuant to the FERC's market-based rate authority remain
in effect and are generally subject to a high standard of review before the FERC
can order any changes.  Recent court decisions by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have raised issues that may make it more difficult
for the FERC to continue its program of promoting wholesale electricity
competition through market-based rate authority.  These court
decisions permit retroactive refunds and a lower standard of review by the FERC
for changing power contracts, and could have the effect of requiring the FERC to
review in advance most, if not all, power contracts.  The FERC has not
yet taken action in response to these recent court decisions, and the U.S.
Supreme Court has decided to review one of these decisions.  At this
time, PPL cannot predict the impact of these court decisions on the FERC's
future market-based rate authority program or on PPL's business.

Illinois Auction
Complaints

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

As a
result of the Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Law of 1997, the
Illinois General Assembly provided the opportunity for power suppliers to
compete to supply power to Illinois electric utilities to meet the full
requirements of all non-shopping Illinois electricity customers.  The
Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) conducted an auction for supply of up to
25,474 MW of peak load and hired an independent Auction Monitor for this
purpose.  PPL EnergyPlus submitted bids in this Illinois auction
process and, as a result, in September 2006 entered into three agreements with
Commonwealth Edison Company to supply a portion of its full requirements
service.  These agreements commenced in January 2007 and expire after
17, 29 and 41 months.  During peak hours, PPL EnergyPlus' obligation
to supply Commonwealth Edison may reach 700 MW.  At the conclusion of
the auction process, the Auction Monitor and the ICC Staff both concluded that
the auction process was competitive.

In March
2007, the Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint at the FERC against all of
the successful bidders in this auction process, including PPL EnergyPlus and
fifteen other suppliers, alleging market manipulation and requesting that the
FERC investigate such allegations, requesting refunds for sales at prices above
just and reasonable rates and seeking revocation of the FERC market-based rate
authority for certain of the suppliers.  PPL EnergyPlus is not
identified in the complaint as a supplier which allegedly engaged in market
manipulation or which should have its market-based rate authority
revoked.

In June
2007, PPL EnergyPlus filed an answer requesting dismissal of the
complaint.  In July 2007, the Illinois Attorney General asked the FERC
to hold this proceeding in abeyance pending a possible settlement among the
Illinois parties, stating that such a settlement, if finalized, would result in
dismissal of its FERC complaint.  In August 2007, the Illinois
Attorney General, along with other parties, filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint with prejudice due to a retail rate and procurement procedure
settlement agreement reached among a number of interested parties in the State
of Illinois.  In October 2007, the FERC dismissed the complaint with
prejudice and terminated the proceeding.

Subsequent
to the Illinois Attorney General's complaint, two class actions were filed in
Illinois State Court in Cook County against all successful bidders in the
Illinois auction, including PPL EnergyPlus, alleging violations of unfair trade
practices laws.  The factual allegations appear similar to those in
the Attorney General's complaint.  In December 2007, the judge issued
an order dismissing the class action cases without prejudice to seek relief from
either the FERC or the Illinois Commerce Commission.  While PPL and
PPL Energy Supply do not currently believe that these matters will have a
material adverse impact on the financial condition of PPL and PPL Energy Supply,
they cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Wallingford
Cost-Based Rates

(

PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In
January 2003, PPL Wallingford and PPL EnergyPlus sought from the FERC cost-based
payments based upon the RMR status of four units at the Wallingford, Connecticut
generating facility.  The FERC initially denied RMR status for the
units, and PPL appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit.  Upon remand by the Court, the FERC reconsidered its
decision and in April 2006, conditionally approved the RMR agreement effective
February 1, 2003, subject to refund and hearing or settlement procedures to
resolve whether the Wallingford units needed the RMR agreement, the proposed
cost-based rates under the RMR agreement and the amounts to be recovered for
past periods under the RMR agreement.

In
September 2006, PPL and certain of the parties filed a written settlement with
the FERC.  Under the terms of the settlement, PPL would receive a
total of $44 million in settlement of amounts due under the RMR agreement for
the period February 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006, and would receive prospective
RMR payments until the agreement terminated.  The $44 million in past
payments (plus interest) would be paid to PPL in approximately equal monthly
installments over a two-year period.  In March 2007, the FERC issued
an order approving the settlement agreement, subject to the condition that the
parties file revisions to provide that the FERC will be bound to the "just and
reasonable" and not the "public interest" standard of review in its
consideration of modifications to the agreement.  In October 2007, the
FERC approved the parties' compliance filing for the March 2007
order.

In June
2007, the RMR agreement terminated in accordance with the settlement to allow
the four Wallingford RMR units to participate in ISO New England's locational
forward reserve market.  The ISO New England locational forward
reserve market provides revenues to peaking generation units that can quickly
come on line from reserve status to meet reliability requirements.

In
September 2007, both PPL and ISO New England agreed to start making payments in
accordance with the settlement agreement.  Consequently, PPL paid ISO
New England $10 million for amounts overcollected from June 2006 to May 2007 and
ISO New England started paying PPL monthly installments of approximately $2
million, which will be received for 24 months.  During the third
quarter of 2007, PPL recognized $55 million of revenue and $4 million of
interest income related to the settlement agreement, of which $21 million had
been previously collected.  Of the total amounts recognized during the
quarter, $57 million, or $33 million after tax (or $0.09, basic and diluted, per
share for PPL), related to periods prior to 2007.

Maine Transmission Line
Rates

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
currently holds 100 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service rights
associated with an existing transmission line owned by Maine Electric Power
Company, Inc. (MEPCO).  MEPCO is owned by Central Maine Power Company,
Bangor Hydro Electric Company and Maine Public Service Company.  These
transmission rights enable PPL to sell energy and capacity from New Brunswick,
Canada into ISO New England.

In August
2007, MEPCO, ISO New England and other New England transmission owners (the
Filing Parties) submitted a filing to the FERC seeking to roll the revenue
requirement of the MEPCO transmission facilities into the regional transmission
rates in New England and to change the ISO New England market rules concerning
the use of the transmission line for energy and capacity.  PPL
protested this proposal because it fails to preserve and protect pre-existing
firm transmission rights currently held on the MEPCO transmission facilities by
PPL EnergyPlus.  If the proposal were accepted by the FERC as filed,
the value of PPL's pre-existing rights on the MEPCO line would be adversely
affected.

In
September 2007, PPL recorded a $21 million ($12 million after tax) impairment of
the transmission rights based on their estimated fair value as determined by an
internal model and other analysis.  This charge is included in "Other
operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income.  These
transmission rights are a component of the Supply segment.

In
October 2007, the FERC issued an order accepting the Filing Parties' proposal,
subject to modification of certain matters presented in the
filing.  Based on the October 2007 Order, PPL EnergyPlus opted to
terminate its contractual rights on the MEPCO line upon effectiveness of the
MEPCO roll-in.  Due to complications implementing the proposal as
modified by the FERC, in November 2007, ISO New England and MEPCO filed with the
FERC an expedited motion to delay the effectiveness and hold a technical
conference or, in the alternative, cancel the MEPCO roll-in.  On
February 4, 2008, the FERC issued a further order in response to the ISO New
England and MEPCO request that authorized appointment of a settlement judge and
deferred the effective date of the MEPCO roll-in proposal to a future date to be
determined.

In
December 2007, PPL recorded an additional $2 million ($1 million after tax)
charge to fully impair these transmission rights.  This charge is
included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statement of
Income.

Montana Public Service
Commissioner's Litigation

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

In May
2006, one of the commissioners of the Montana PSC commenced an action in Montana
First Judicial District Court against PPL Montana and the Montana PSC seeking to
cause the Montana PSC to reverse its 1999 order consenting to EWG status for PPL
Montana's power plants.  In 1999, the FERC had granted the plants EWG
status and the authority to sell electricity produced at market-based rates, and
the Montana PSC consented to this status for PPL Montana's plants under a
provision of federal law.  In September 2006, the Court granted PPL
Montana's and the Montana PSC's motions to dismiss this action.  The
plaintiff has appealed the dismissal of the lawsuit to the Montana Supreme
Court.  In February 2008, the Montana Supreme Court upheld the lower
court's decision in this matter.

IRS Synthetic Fuels Tax
Credits

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL,
through its subsidiaries, has interests in two synthetic fuel production
facilities: the Somerset facility located in Pennsylvania and the Tyrone
facility located in Kentucky.  PPL has received tax credits pursuant
to Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code based on the sale of synthetic
fuel from these facilities.  The Section 29/45K tax credit program
expired at the end of 2007, and production of synthetic fuel at these facilities
and all other synthetic fuel operations ceased as of December 31,
2007.  PPL is in the process of retiring its interests in these
facilities.

To
qualify for the Section 29/45K tax credits, synthetic fuel must have been
produced and sold prior to December 31, 2007, and satisfied three primary
conditions:  (i) there must have been a significant chemical change in
the coal feedstock, (ii) the product must have been sold to an unaffiliated
entity, and (iii) the production facility must have been placed in service
before July 1, 1998.

In
addition, Section 29/45K provided for the synthetic fuel tax credit to begin to
phase out when the relevant annual reference price for crude oil, which is the
domestic first purchase price (DFPP), fell within a designated range and to be
eliminated when the DFPP exceeds the range.  The phase-out range was
adjusted annually for inflation.  Currently, the DFPP is published by
the IRS in April for the prior year and is calculated based on the annual
average wellhead price per barrel for all unregulated domestic crude
oil.

PPL
currently estimates the phase-out range for 2007 to begin at about $57 per
barrel (DFPP) and the tax credits to be totally eliminated at about $71 per
barrel (DFPP).  PPL currently expects a phase-out of approximately 56%
of the gross tax credits produced in 2007, based on its estimate of the DFPP
reference price and the phase-out range applicable for 2007.  PPL
cannot currently predict or estimate with certainty the final DFPP reference
price for crude oil or the phase-out range for 2007.

The
synthetic fuel produced at the Somerset and Tyrone facilities resulted in an
aggregate estimated recognition of tax credits of $321 million for Somerset and
$118 million for Tyrone through December 31, 2007, including estimated amounts
for 2007.  After considering the estimated 2007 phase-out of
approximately 56%, PPL recognized tax credits of $29 million for Somerset and
$23 million for Tyrone for 2007.

PPL had
economic hedge transactions in 2007 that mitigated PPL's tax credit phase-out
risk due to an increase of the DFPP reference price in 2007.  The
mark-to-market value of these hedges is reflected in "Energy-related businesses"
revenues on the Statement of Income.  The hedge transactions were
settled in December 2007.

PPL
performed impairment reviews of both its synthetic fuel production facilities
during the second quarter of 2006.  The reviews were prompted by the
temporary suspension of operations at Somerset in April 2006, the uncertainty
surrounding the future operations of each of the facilities and continued
observed and forecasted high crude oil prices at that time.  PPL
determined that the net book value of the facilities exceeded the projected
undiscounted cash flows.  Therefore, in the second quarter of 2006,
PPL recorded charges totaling $10 million ($6 million after tax) to fully impair
its synfuel-related assets based on an internal model and other
analysis.  The impairment charges were reflected in "Energy-related
businesses" expenses on the Statements of Income.  The assets of the
facilities are a component of the Supply segment.

PPL also
purchased synthetic fuel from unaffiliated third parties, at prices below the
market price of coal, for use at its coal-fired power plants.  Fuel
cost savings in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $24 million, $18 million and $24
million.

In
October 2003, it was reported that the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, had begun an
investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and its producers.  That
investigation is ongoing.  PPL cannot predict when the investigation
will be completed or the potential results of the investigation.

Energy
Policy Act of 2005

(PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL
Electric)

In August
2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005
Energy Act).  The 2005 Energy Act is comprehensive legislation that
substantially affects the regulation of energy companies.  The Act
amends federal energy laws and provides the FERC with new oversight
responsibilities.  Among the important changes that have been or will
be implemented as a result of this legislation are:

The
implementation of the 2005 Energy Act requires proceedings at the state level
and the development of regulations, some of which have not been finalized, by
the FERC, the DOE and other federal agencies.  PPL cannot predict when
all of these proceedings and regulations will be finalized.

The
implemented Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law, and apply to
certain users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility
companies, generators and marketers.  The FERC has indicated that it
intends to vigorously enforce the Reliability Standards using, among other
means, civil penalty authority.  Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC
may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for certain
violations.  The first group of Reliability Standards approved by the
FERC became effective in June 2007.  In September 2007, PPL Electric
self-reported to the RFC, a regional reliability entity designated to enforce
the Reliability Standards, that it had identified a potential violation of
certain reliability requirements and submitted an accompanying mitigation
plan.  In December 2007, RFC notified PPL Electric that it had
completed its initial review and found an "Alleged Violation" of one NERC
Reliability Standard requirement.

PPL
Electric cannot predict the final outcome of the RFC's inquiry into the Alleged
Violation or what, if any, penalties may be assessed if a violation is
determined in fact to have occurred.  PPL and its subsidiaries cannot
predict the impact generally that the Reliability Standards will have on PPL and
its subsidiaries, including on its capital and operating expenditures, however,
compliance costs could be significant.

PPL also
cannot predict with certainty the impact of the other provisions of the 2005
Energy Act and any related regulations on PPL and its subsidiaries.

Environmental
Matters - Domestic

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Due to
the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, PPL
subsidiaries may be required to modify, curtail, replace or cease operating
certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by
regulatory bodies or courts.  In this regard, PPL subsidiaries also
may incur capital expenditures or operating expenses in amounts which are not
now determinable, but could be significant.

Air

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

The Clean
Air Act deals, in part, with emissions causing acid deposition, attainment of
federal ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions and visibility in
the U.S.  Amendments to the Clean Air Act requiring additional
emission reductions are likely to continue to be proposed in the U.S.
Congress.  The Clean Air Act allows states to develop more stringent
regulations and in some instances, as discussed below, Pennsylvania and Montana
have chosen to do so.

Clean Air Interstate
Rule

Citing
its authority under the Clean Air Act, in 1997, the EPA developed new standards
for ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the U.S.  These
standards have been upheld following court challenges.  To facilitate
attainment of these standards, the EPA has promulgated the Clean Air Interstate
Rule (CAIR) for 28 midwestern and eastern states, including Pennsylvania, to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by about 50% by 2010 and to extend the current
seasonal program for reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions to a year-round
program starting in 2009.  The CAIR requires further reductions in the
CAIR region, starting in 2015, in sulfur dioxide of 30% from 2010 levels, and
nitrogen oxides during the ozone season of 17% from 2009 levels.  The
CAIR allows these reductions to be achieved through cap-and-trade
programs.

In
addition, the EPA has recently proposed tightening the ambient air quality
standard for ozone.  A more stringent standard could result in
requirements to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides beyond those required under
the CAIR.  If additional reductions were required, the costs are not
now determinable, but could be significant.

In order
to continue meeting existing sulfur dioxide reduction requirements of the Clean
Air Act, including the CAIR, PPL is installing flue gas desulfurization systems
(scrubbers) at its Montour and Brunner Island plants.  The scrubbers
for both Montour units and Unit 3 at Brunner Island are expected to be
in-service during 2008 and the scrubber for Units 1 and 2 at Brunner Island is
expected to be in-service during 2009.  Based on expected levels of
generation and projected emission allowance prices, PPL has determined that it
is more cost effective to install these scrubbers than to purchase significant
additional emission allowances to make up the emission allowance shortfalls that
would otherwise occur.  In order to meet the year-round reductions in
nitrogen oxides under the CAIR, PPL's current plan is to operate the SCRs at
Montour Units 1 and 2 year-round, optimize emission reductions from the existing
combustion controls and purchase any needed emission allowances on the open
market.  PPL's current installation plan for the scrubbers and other
pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate and
nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction) through 2012
reflects a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion, of which $0.9 billion has
already been spent.  PPL expects a 30 MW reduction in net generation
capability at each of the Brunner Island and Montour plants, due to the
estimated increases in station service usage during the scrubber
operation.

Mercury

Also
citing its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA issued the Clean Air
Mercury Regulations (CAMR) that affect coal-fired plants.  These
regulations established a cap-and-trade program to take effect in two phases,
with a first phase to begin in January 2010, and a second phase with more
stringent requirements to begin in January 2018.  However, in February
2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned
the EPA's rule.  Under this opinion, the EPA must either properly
remove mercury from regulation under the hazardous air pollutant provisions of
the Clean Air Act or develop standards requiring maximum achievable control
technology for mercury emissions.

The
ruling is not expected to affect PPL's current plans to comply with state
regulations in Pennsylvania and Montana as discussed below.  PPL
continues to review the federal court opinion to determine whether it has any
effect on state regulations in the long term.

Pennsylvania
has adopted its own, more stringent mercury rules.  Pennsylvania's
rules establish mercury emission limits for each coal-fired generating facility
beginning in 2010, and require that mercury emission allowances under the EPA's
cap-and-trade program under CAMR be met at each unit without the benefit of an
emissions trading program, and that tighter emission limits based on the second
phase of the CAMR requirements be accelerated to begin in 2015.  PPL
cannot predict what Pennsylvania may do with the mercury allowance provisions,
as the CAMR cap-and-trade program on which those allowances were based has now
been overturned.

PPL
expects that it can achieve the 2010 requirements under Pennsylvania's mercury
rules with only the addition of chemical injection systems.  This
expectation is based on the co-benefits of mercury removal from the scrubbers
expected to be in place at its Pennsylvania plants as of 2010, and the SCRs
already in place at Montour.  PPL currently estimates that the capital
cost of such chemical injection systems at its Pennsylvania plants will be
approximately $23 million.

To meet
Pennsylvania's 2015 requirements, adsorption/absorption technology with fabric
filters may be required at most PPL Pennsylvania coal-fired generating
units.  Based on current analysis and industry estimates, PPL
estimates that if this technology were required at every one of its Pennsylvania
units, the aggregate capital cost of compliance would be approximately $530
million.

Montana
also has finalized its own more stringent rules that would require by 2010 every
coal-fired generating plant in the state to achieve reduction levels more
stringent than the CAMR's 2018 requirements.  PPL presently plans to
install chemical injection systems to meet these requirements.  PPL
estimates its share of the capital cost for these systems in Montana would be
approximately $8 million.  Because enhanced chemical injection
technologies may not be sufficiently developed to meet this level of reductions
by 2010, there is a risk that adsorption/absorption technology with fabric
filters at both Colstrip and Corette would be required.  Based on
current analysis and industry estimates, PPL estimates that if this technology
were required, its capital cost to achieve compliance at its Montana units would
be approximately $140 million.

PPL
expects both Pennsylvania's and Montana's mercury rules to be challenged in
court.  PPL cannot predict the outcome of such actions.

As PPL
continues to explore what mercury control technology(s) will be selected for
installation at its units, one concern that needs to be assessed, along with the
effectiveness of mercury reductions, is the unintended potential increase in
particulate emissions and whether that increase would trigger Prevention of
Significant Deterioration/New Source Review (PSD/NSR).

This
concern arises because certain technologies use chemical additives to "collect"
and/or convert mercury so that the existing pollution controls will more
effectively remove mercury.  Use of such additives, depending on the
amount used and the performance of existing particulate controls, could result
in an increase in the particulate emissions and might trigger
PSD/NSR.  If PSD/NSR is triggered, then controls cannot be installed
until a new source permit is obtained, which would include extensive modeling,
analysis and implementation of best available control technology for
particulates.  This issue is undergoing further internal review and
analysis.

Regional Haze and
Visibility

In
addition to the above rules, the Clean Air Visibility Rule was issued by the EPA
on June 15, 2005, to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility
caused by multiple sources over a wide area.  The rule defines Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units,
including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides controls for
large units.  Under the BART rule, PPL has submitted to the
Pennsylvania DEP and the EPA (Region 8), which administers the BART program for
Montana, its analyses of the visibility impacts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and particulate matter emissions from plants covered by the BART rule in
Pennsylvania and Montana, respectively.  In Pennsylvania, this
includes Martins Creek Units 3 and 4, Brunner Island Units 2 and 3 and Montour
Units 1 and 2.  In Montana, this includes Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and
Corette.  PPL's analyses have shown that further reductions are not
needed.  The Pennsylvania DEP has not yet acted on the
reports.  However, the EPA has responded to PPL's reports for Colstrip
and Corette and has requested further information and analysis.  PPL
cannot predict whether any additional reductions will be required in
Pennsylvania or Montana.  If additional reductions are required, the
costs are not now determinable, but could be significant.

New Source
Review

In 1999,
the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric generators,
asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those generators have,
over the years, been modified in ways that subjected them to more stringent "New
Source" requirements under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA subsequently
issued notices of violation and commenced enforcement activities against other
generators.

However,
in recent years, the EPA has shifted its position on New Source
Review.  In 2003, the EPA issued changes to its regulations that
clarified what projects are exempt from "New Source" requirements as routine
maintenance and repair.  However, these regulations were stayed and
subsequently struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit.  Furthermore, in April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld the annual emissions test under which the EPA had found emissions
increases at the plants included in its enforcement initiative.  PPL
is therefore continuing to operate under the "New Source" regulations as they
existed prior to the EPA's 2003 clarifications.

In
October 2005, the EPA proposed changing its rules on how to determine whether a
project results in an emissions increase and is therefore subject to review
under the "New Source" regulations.  The EPA's proposed tests are
consistent with the position of energy companies and industry groups and, if
adopted, would substantially reduce the uncertainties under the current
regulations.  PPL cannot predict whether these proposed new tests will
be adopted.  In addition to proposing these new tests, the EPA also
announced in October 2005 that it will not bring new enforcement actions with
respect to projects that would satisfy the proposed new tests or the EPA's 2003
clarifications referenced above.  Accordingly, PPL believes it is
unlikely the EPA will pursue the information requests issued to PPL Montana's
Corette and Colstrip plants by EPA Region 8 in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and
to PPL Generation's Martins Creek plant by EPA Region 3 in
2002.  However, states and environmental groups also have been
bringing enforcement actions alleging violations of "New Source" requirements by
coal-fired plants, and PPL is unable to predict whether such state or citizens
enforcement actions will be brought with respect to any of its affiliates'
plants.

Finally,
if the EPA regulates carbon dioxide emissions pursuant to the recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision on global climate change, then carbon dioxide emissions
could become subject to the PSD/NSR provisions of the Clean Air
Act.  The implications are uncertain, as currently no permitting
authorities have implemented the PSD/NSR program for carbon dioxide
emissions.

Opacity

The New
Jersey DEP and some New Jersey residents have raised environmental concerns with
respect to the visible opacity of emissions from the oil-fired units at the
Martins Creek plant.  Similar issues also are being raised by the
Pennsylvania DEP.  PPL is continuing to study and negotiate the matter
with the Pennsylvania DEP.  If it is determined that actions must be
taken to address the visible opacity of these emissions, such actions could
result in costs that are not now determinable, but could be
significant.  In September 2007, in accordance with a 2003 agreement
with the New Jersey DEP and the Pennsylvania DEP, PPL shut down Martins Creek's
two 150 MW coal-fired generating units, but may replace or repower them at
any time so long as it complies with all applicable state and federal
requirements.

Global Climate
Change

There is
a growing concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and
the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly,
carbon dioxide.  This concern has led to increased federal legislative
proposals, actions at state or local levels, as well as litigation relating to
greenhouse gas emissions, including an April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision
holding that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from
new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act.  The EPA has also agreed,
following this decision, to a remand of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)
applicable to stationary sources to reconsider its approach to including
greenhouse gases under such rules.  If the EPA concludes greenhouse
gases from motor vehicles pose an endangerment to public health or welfare, this
could lead to regulation of stationary source carbon dioxide
emissions.  The EPA might also proceed directly under the NSPS to
regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources.  Also, increased
pressure for carbon dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by investor
and environmental organizations and the international community.  In
addition, a nuisance claim brought by a number of states against other large
electric generating companies was dismissed by a federal district court in New
York but remains pending on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.

PPL
believes future governmental legislation and regulations that caps or taxes
carbon dioxide emissions from power plants are likely, although technology to
efficiently capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions is not presently
available.  At the federal level such regulation has received support
from the majority leadership in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of
Representatives.  PPL supports a national program and has publicly
supported the key concepts of the "Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007" introduced in
the Senate in July 2007, including an economy-wide approach, a gradual phase-in
of targets and timetables and cost containment measures to cap the cost to the
economy.

At the
regional level, ten northeastern states signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) agreeing to establish a cap-and-trade program, called the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).  The program commences in January
2009 and calls for stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions, at base levels
established in 2005, from electric power plants larger than 25 MW in
capacity.  The MOU also provides for a 10% reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions from base levels by 2019.  A similar effort is under way in
the western U.S. (the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative or "WCI"), and
Midwestern states have recently agreed to form another regional climate change
program.

Pennsylvania
and Montana have not, at this time, established mandatory programs to regulate
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Pennsylvania has not
stated an intention to join RGGI, but has declared support for state action on
climate change and Montana has expressed an interest in joining
WCI.  PPL has conducted an inventory of its carbon dioxide emissions
and is continuing to evaluate various options for reducing, avoiding,
off-setting or sequestering its carbon dioxide emissions.  In 2007,
PPL's power plants emitted in excess of approximately 31 million tons of carbon
dioxide (based on PPL's equity share of these assets).

PPL
believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material
impact on its capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not now
determinable.  PPL also cannot predict the impact that any pending or
future federal or state legislation regarding more stringent environmental
standards could have on PPL or its subsidiaries.

Water/Waste

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

Martins Creek Fly Ash
Release

In August
2005, there was a release of approximately 100 million gallons of water
containing fly ash from a disposal basin at the Martins Creek plant used in
connection with the operation of the two 150 MW coal-fired generating units
at the plant.  This resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent
roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware
River.  The leak was stopped, and PPL has determined that the problem
was caused by a failure in the disposal basin's discharge
structure.  PPL has conducted extensive clean-up and completed
studies, in conjunction with a group of natural resource trustees and the
Delaware River Basin Commission, evaluating the effects of the release on the
river's sediment, water quality and ecosystem.  These studies do not
show any environmental damage attributable to the release.

The
Pennsylvania DEP filed a complaint in Commonwealth Court against PPL Martins
Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state laws and
regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief.  The Delaware
Riverside Conservancy and several citizens have been granted the right, without
objection from PPL, to intervene in the Pennsylvania DEP's
action.  PPL and the Pennsylvania DEP have reached a tentative
settlement for the alleged violations.  The Intervenors have objected
to this settlement.  The proposed settlement requires PPL to pay $1.5
million in penalties and reimbursement of the DEP's costs, and requires PPL to
submit a report on the completed studies of possible natural resource
damages.  PPL submitted the assessment report to the agencies in June
2007.  However, the agencies may require additional
studies.  In addition, PPL expects the trustees and the Delaware River
Basin Commission to seek to recover their costs and/or any damages they
determine were caused by the release.

During
2005, PPL Energy Supply recognized a $48 million charge ($31 million after tax)
in connection with the then-expected on-site and off-site costs relating to the
remediation.  Based on its ongoing assessment of the expected
remediation costs, in 2006, PPL Energy Supply reduced the estimate in connection
with the current expected costs of the leak by $11 million, of which $10 million
related to off-site costs and the remainder to on-site costs.  The
reduction was included in "Other operation and maintenance" expense on the
Statement of Income.  At December 31, 2007, management's best
estimate of the probable loss associated with the Martins Creek ash basin leak
remained at $37 million, of which $31 million relates to off-site costs, and the
balance to on-site costs.  Based on actual costs incurred and recorded
to date, at December 31, 2007, the remaining contingency for this
remediation was $9 million.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot be
certain of the outcome of the action initiated by the Pennsylvania DEP, the
outcome of the natural resource damage assessment, the outcome of any lawsuit
brought by the citizens and businesses and the exact nature of any other
regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against PPL, PPL Energy
Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin
leak.

Basin Seepage -
Pennsylvania

Seepages
have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins at various PPL
plants, including the Montour, Brunner Island and Martins Creek generating
facilities.  PPL has completed an assessment of some of the seepages
at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities and is working with the
Pennsylvania DEP to implement abatement measures for those
seepages.  PPL is continuing to conduct assessments of other seepages
at the Montour and Brunner Island facilities as well as seepages at the Martins
Creek facility to determine the appropriate abatement actions.  PPL's
2008 â 2012 capital budgets include $50 million to upgrade and/or replace
certain wastewater facilities in response to the seepage and for other facility
changes.  The potential additional cost to address the identified
seepages or other seepages at all of PPL's Pennsylvania plants is not now
determinable, but could be significant.

Basin Seepage -
Montana

In May
2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs brought an action now pending at the Montana
Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County, against PPL Montana and the
other owners of the Colstrip plant alleging property damage from seepage from
the freshwater and wastewater ponds at Colstrip.  In February 2007,
six plaintiffs filed a separate lawsuit in the same court against the Colstrip
plant owners asserting similar claims.  PPL Montana has undertaken
certain groundwater investigation and remediation measures at the Colstrip plant
to address groundwater contamination alleged by the plaintiffs as well as other
groundwater contamination at the plant.  These measures include
proceeding with extending city water to certain residents who live near the
plant, some of whom are plaintiffs in the original litigation.  Based
on a revised settlement offer at a September 2007 mandatory mediation session
with the original 2003 plaintiffs, PPL Montana has recorded an additional
reserve of $1 million for its share of the proposed settlement
cost.  A trial is scheduled for June 2008.  PPL Montana may
incur further costs based on the outcome of the lawsuits and its additional
groundwater investigations and any related remedial measures, which costs are
not now determinable, but could be significant.

Other
Issues

The EPA
has significantly increased the water quality standard for
arsenic.  The revised standard became effective in January 2006 and at
this time applies only to drinking water.  The revised standard may
result in action by individual states that could require several PPL
subsidiaries to further treat wastewater or take abatement action at their power
plants, or both.  The cost of complying with any such requirements is
not now determinable, but could be significant.

The EPA
finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake
structures.  These requirements affect where generating facilities are
built, establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for
cooling towers at new and modified power plants.  Another rule
finalized in 2004 that addressed existing structures has been withdrawn
following a January 2007 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.  Depending on what changes the EPA makes to the rule in
accordance with this decision, and/or what actions the states may take on their
own, the impacts of the actions could result in stricter standards for existing
structures that could impose significant costs on PPL subsidiaries.

The EPA
plans to finalize the 2008 Effluent Guidelines Plan by August 2008, in which the
EPA will make a decision about whether to revise the steam electric effluent
guidelines.  The EPA is presently conducting a sampling study of
industry discharges to obtain information needed to make that
decision.

Superfund
and Other Remediation

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric is a potentially responsible party at several sites listed by the EPA
under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant
Site.  Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of
these sites, the costs of which have not been significant.  However,
should the EPA require significantly different or additional measures in the
future, the costs of such measures are not determinable, but could be
significant.

PPL
Electric and PPL Gas Utilities have been remediating several sites that were not
being addressed under another regulatory program such as Superfund, but for
which PPL Electric or PPL Gas Utilities may be liable for
remediation.  These include a number of coal gas manufacturing
facilities formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric; coal gas manufacturing
facilities and potential mercury contamination from gas meters and regulators at
PPL Gas Utilities' sites and plugging of abandoned wells by PPL Gas
Utilities.

Depending
on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or
have not been completed, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be
substantial.  PPL and its subsidiaries also could incur other
non-remediation costs at sites included in the consent orders or other
contaminated sites, the costs of which are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

The EPA
is evaluating the risks associated with naphthalene, a chemical by-product of
coal gas manufacturing operations.  As a result of the EPA's
evaluation, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality
and soil clean-up.  This could require several PPL subsidiaries to
take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas
manufacturing facilities.  The costs to PPL of complying with any such
requirements are not now determinable, but could be significant.

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Under the
Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated to
remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take
additional measures to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped
refuse piles.  One PPL Generation subsidiary is pumping mine water at
two mine sites, and treating water at one of these sites.  Another PPL
Generation subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a
third site.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply had accrued
a discounted liability of $34 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating
groundwater at the two mine sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining
passive wetlands treatment at the third site.  PPL Energy Supply
discounted this liability at a rate of 5.74%.  Expected undiscounted
payments are estimated at $1 million for each of the years from 2008 through
2012, and the expected payments for the work after 2012 are $135
million.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

Future
cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not
currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for PPL
subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time.

Gas Seepage

(PPL)

PPL Gas
Utilities owns and operates the Meeker gas storage field and has a partial
ownership interest in the Tioga gas storage field, both located in north-central
Pennsylvania.  There continues to be an issue with natural gas
observed in several drinking water wells that the Pennsylvania DEP has been
working to address.  The Pennsylvania DEP has raised concerns that
potential leakage of natural gas from the Tioga gas storage field could be
contributing to this issue.  To help determine the cause of the
natural gas in the potable water wells, the Pennsylvania DEP enlisted the
services of the U.S. Geological Survey Department.  The results of the
U.S. Geological Survey study were published in mid-2007 and indicate that gas in
the groundwater in the area, including in certain residential wells, may be due
in part to gas stored in the storage fields.  PPL Gas Utilities is
working with the Pennsylvania DEP and the co-owner/operator of the Tioga field
to develop a comprehensive study to determine whether gas in the wells is, in
fact, due to storage field operations.  In the interim, pending
completion of a more detailed study of the issue, PPL Gas Utilities and the
co-owner of the Tioga storage field have offered to sample potable water wells
and install water treatment systems on any wells in which natural gas exceeds 20
parts per million within an agreed-upon program area.  The cost of the
actions in the program area offered by PPL Gas Utilities and the co-owner are
not expected to be significant.  The costs of the broader study and
any required mitigation actions are not now determinable, but could be
significant.

Concerns
have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health
effects of power frequency EMFs, which are emitted by all devices carrying
electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and
substation equipment.  Government officials in the U.S. and the U.K.
have reviewed this issue.  The U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes,
there is no evidence that EMFs cause adverse effects.  The agency
further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with
childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without
supporting laboratory evidence.  The U.K. National Radiological
Protection Board (part of the U.K. Health Protection Agency) concluded in 2004
that, while the research on EMFs does not provide a basis to find that EMFs
cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond
existing exposure guidelines.  In April 2007, the Stakeholder Group on
Extremely Low Frequency EMF, set up by the U.K. Government, issued its interim
assessment which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to
EMFs.  This assessment is being considered by the U.K.
Government.  PPL and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to
determine whether EMFs cause adverse health effects should continue and are
taking steps to reduce EMFs, where practical, in the design of new transmission
and distribution facilities.  PPL and its subsidiaries are unable to
predict what effect, if any, the EMF issue might have on their operations and
facilities either in the U.S. or the U.K., and the associated cost, or what, if
any, liabilities they might incur related to the EMF issue.

completion of the sale of each of the businesses.

Other

Nuclear
Insurance

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

PPL
Susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage for
property damage to members' nuclear

generating
stations.  Facilities at the Susquehanna station are insured against
property damage losses up to $2.75 billion under these programs.  PPL
Susquehanna is also a member of an insurance program that provides insurance
coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear
units caused by certain specified conditions.  Under the property and
replacement power insurance programs, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed
retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss
experience.  At December 31, 2007, this maximum assessment was about
$38 million.

In the
event of a nuclear incident at the Susquehanna station, PPL Susquehanna's public
liability for claims resulting from such an incident would be limited to about
$10.8 billion under provisions of The Price-Anderson Act Amendments to the
Energy Policy Act of 2005.  PPL Susquehanna is protected against this
liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment
program.  In the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors
covered by The Price-Anderson Act Amendments to the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $201 million per incident, payable at
$30 million per year.

Guarantees and Other
Assurances

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

In the
normal course of business, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric enter into
agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on
behalf of certain subsidiaries.  Such agreements include, for example,
guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and
surety bonds issued by insurance companies.  These agreements are
entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to
a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities
in which these subsidiaries enter.

(PPL)

PPL fully
and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of PPL Capital
Funding.

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric provide certain guarantees that are required to
be disclosed in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission
of FASB Interpretation No. 34."  The table below details guarantees
provided as of December 31, 2007.

WPD
      guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated
      entities





As
      a result of the privatization of the utility industry in the U.K., certain
      electric associations' roles and responsibilities were discontinued or
      modified.  As a result, certain obligations, primarily
      pension-related, associated with these organizations have been guaranteed
      by the participating members.  Costs are allocated to the
      members based on predetermined percentages as outlined in specific
      agreements.  However, if a member becomes insolvent, costs can
      be reallocated to and are guaranteed by the remaining
      members.  At December 31, 2007, WPD has recorded an estimated
      discounted liability based on its current allocated percentage of the
      total expected costs.  Neither the expiration date nor the
      maximum amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly
      stated in the related agreements.  Therefore, they have been
      estimated based on the types of obligations.

Tax
      indemnification related to unconsolidated WPD affiliates



Two
      WPD unconsolidated affiliates were refinanced during
      2005.  Under the terms of the refinancing, WPD has indemnified
      the lender against certain tax and other liabilities.  At this
      time, WPD believes that the likelihood of such liabilities arising is
      remote.

      the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be
      required to be made under the guarantee.

(b)

Other
      than the letters of credit, all guarantees of PPL Energy Supply and PPL
      Electric also apply to PPL on a consolidated
  basis.

PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries provide other
miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of
business.  These guarantees are primarily in the form of
indemnifications or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in
duration.  The obligated amounts of these guarantees often are not
explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated.  Historically, PPL, PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric and their subsidiaries have not made any
significant payments with respect to these types of guarantees.  As of
December 31, 2007, the aggregate fair value of these indemnifications related to
arrangements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002, was
insignificant.  Among these guarantees are:

PPL, on
behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that
covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property
damage.  The coverage requires a $4 million deductible per occurrence
and provides maximum aggregate coverage of $185 million.  This
insurance may be applicable to certain obligations under the contractual
arrangements discussed above.

Related Party Transactions

Affiliate
Trust

(PPL and PPL Energy
Supply)

At
December 31, 2006, both PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Balance Sheets reflected
$89 million of "Long-term Debt with Affiliate Trust."  This debt
represented obligations of WPD LLP under 8.23% Subordinated Debentures maturing
in February 2027 that were held by SIUK Capital Trust I, a variable interest
entity whose common securities were owned by WPD LLP but which was not
consolidated by WPD LLP.  In February 2007, WPD LLP redeemed all of
the 8.23% Subordinated Debentures that were held by SUIK Capital Trust
I.  Interest expense on this obligation was $2 million, $11 million
and $12 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005.  The redemption resulted in a
pre-tax loss of $2 million being recorded in 2007.  This interest and
loss are reflected in "Interest Expense" for PPL and "Interest Expense with
Affiliates" for PPL Energy Supply on the Statements of Income.  See
Note 8 for a discussion of the redemption of the Subordinated Debentures and the
trust's common and preferred securities in February 2007 and Note 22 for
additional information on the trust.

PLR
Contracts

(PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric has power sales agreements with PPL EnergyPlus, effective July 2000 and
January 2002, in which PPL EnergyPlus will supply all of PPL Electric's PLR load
through December 31, 2009.  Under these contracts, PPL EnergyPlus
provides electricity at the predetermined capped prices that PPL Electric is
authorized to charge its PLR customers.  These purchases totaled $1.8
billion in 2007, $1.7 billion in 2006 and $1.6 billion in 2005.  These
purchases include nuclear decommissioning recovery and amortization of an
up-front contract payment and are included in the Statements of Income as
"Wholesale energy marketing to affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Energy
purchases from affiliate" by PPL Electric.

Under one
of the PLR contracts, PPL Electric is required to make performance assurance
deposits with PPL EnergyPlus when the market price of electricity is less than
the contract price by more than its contract collateral
threshold.  Conversely, PPL EnergyPlus is required to make performance
assurance deposits with PPL Electric when the market price of electricity is
greater than the contract price by more than its contract collateral
threshold.  PPL Electric estimated that at December 31, 2007, the
market price of electricity would exceed the contract price by approximately
$2.5 billion.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply
was required to provide PPL Electric with performance assurance of $300 million,
the maximum amount required under the contract.  PPL Energy Supply's
deposit with PPL Electric was $300 million at both December 31, 2007 and
2006.  This deposit is shown on the Balance Sheets as "Collateral on
PLR energy supply to/from affiliate," a current asset of PPL Energy Supply and a
current liability of PPL Electric.  PPL Electric pays interest equal
to the one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% on this deposit, which is included in "Interest
Expense with Affiliate" on the Statements of Income.  PPL Energy
Supply records the receipt of the interest as affiliated interest income, which
is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statements of
Income.  Interest related to this deposit was $17 million, $17 million
and $12 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

In 2001,
PPL Electric made a $90 million up-front payment to PPL EnergyPlus in connection
with the PLR contracts.  The up-front payment is being amortized by
both parties over the term of the PLR contracts.  The unamortized
balance of this payment and other payments under the contract was $24 million
and $35 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  These current and
noncurrent balances are reported on the Balance Sheets as "Deferred revenue on
PLR energy supply to affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Prepayment on PLR
energy supply from affiliate" by PPL Electric.

Under
Pennsylvania law and PUC regulations, PPL Electric is required to buy
electricity generation supply for customers who do not choose a competitive
supplier.  As previously announced, PPL Electric has conducted two of
its six planned competitive solicitations for generation supply in 2010, after
its existing PLR contract expires.  Competitive bids have been
solicited for 1,700 MW of generation supply, or one-third of PPL Electric's
expected supply requirements for these customers in 2010.  An
independent company, NERA Economic Consulting (NERA), is managing this
competitive solicitation process.  NERA compiled the results from the
first 850 MW solicitation, which were then presented to and approved by the PUC
in July 2007.  The results from the second competitive solicitation,
for an additional 850 MW of generation supply, were presented by NERA to the PUC
on October 2, 2007 and were approved by the PUC on October 4,
2007.  Additional bids will be sought twice each in 2008 and 2009 to
secure the remainder of supply needed to serve PPL Electric's customers in
2010.

PPL
EnergyPlus was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive
solicitation process and has entered into an agreement with PPL Electric to
supply up to 671 MW of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42
per MWh.

Under the
standard Supply Master Agreement for the bid solicitation process, PPL Electric
requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined
credit limits.  In no instance is PPL Electric required to post
collateral to suppliers under these supply contracts.  PPL EnergyPlus
is required to post collateral with PPL Electric when the market price of
electricity to be delivered by PPL EnergyPlus exceeds the contract price for the
forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered and this market price
exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit.  Based on the current
credit rating of PPL Energy Supply, as guarantor, this credit limit is $35
million.

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Electric has credit exposure to PPL EnergyPlus under the
PLR contracts and the July 2007 supply contract discussed above, of $2.5
billion.  As a result of netting arrangements, PPL Electric's credit
exposure was reduced to $2.4 billion.

PPL
Energy Supply has credit exposure to PPL Electric under PLR
contracts.  At December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply's credit exposure
with PPL Electric was $162 million, excluding the effects of netting
arrangements.  As a result of netting arrangements, PPL Energy
Supply's credit exposure was reduced to zero.

NUG
Purchases

(PPL Energy
Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL
Electric has a reciprocal contract with PPL EnergyPlus to sell electricity
purchased under contracts with NUGs.  PPL Electric purchases
electricity from the NUGs at contractual rates and then sells the electricity at
the same price to PPL EnergyPlus.  These purchases totaled $156
million in 2007, $157 million in 2006 and $148 million in 2005.  These
amounts are included in the Statements of Income as "Energy purchases from
affiliate" by PPL Energy Supply, and as "Wholesale electric to affiliate" by PPL
Electric.

Allocations of Corporate Service
Costs

(PPL

PPL
Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources
and information services.  PPL Services charges the respective PPL
subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically
identified.  The cost of these services that is not directly charged
to PPL subsidiaries is allocated to certain of the subsidiaries based on an
average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and
maintenance expenses, and number of employees.  PPL Services allocated
the following amounts, which PPL management believes are reasonable, to PPL
Energy Supply and PPL Electric, including amounts applied to accounts that are
further distributed between capital and expense.

Intercompany
Borrowings

(PPL

PPL
Energy Supply had no notes receivable from affiliates at December 31, 2007 and
2006.  Interest earned on loans to affiliates throughout the year,
included in "Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income, was $12 million,
$4 million and $3 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

In May
2006, PPL Energy Supply terminated a note payable to an affiliate which allowed
borrowings up to $650 million until May 2010.  Interest was payable
monthly in arrears at LIBOR plus 1%.  There was an insignificant
amount of interest expense on this note in 2006.  Such interest
expense totaled $9 million in 2005.  Interest expense is reflected in
"Interest Expense with Affiliates" on the Statements of Income.

(

PPL Electric)

In August
2004, a PPL Electric subsidiary issued a $300 million demand note to an
affiliate.  There was a balance outstanding of $277 million at
December 31, 2007, and $300 million at December 31,
2006.  Interest is due quarterly at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR
plus 1% in 2007 and 1.25% in 2006 and 2005.  This note is shown on the
Balance Sheets as "Note receivable from affiliate."  Interest earned
on the note is included in "Other Income - net" on the Statements of Income, and
was $19 million, $20 million and $14 million for 2007, 2006 and
2005.

Intercompany Derivatives

(PPL
Energy Supply)

In 2007,
2006, and 2005, PPL Energy Supply entered into a combination of average rate
forwards and average rate options with PPL to sell British pounds
sterling.  These hedging instruments had terms identical to average
rate forwards and average rate options entered into by PPL with third parties to
protect expected income denominated in British pounds sterling.  Gains
and losses on these hedging instruments are included in "Other income - net" on
the Statements of Income.  For 2007, 2006, and 2005, PPL Energy Supply
recorded net losses of $4 million, $4 million and $1 million.  None of
these instruments were outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply entered into forward contracts with PPL to sell Chilean
pesos.  These hedging instruments had terms identical to forward sales
contracts entered into by PPL with third parties to protect the value of its net
investment in Emel as well as a portion of the proceeds in excess of its net
investment expected from the then-anticipated sale of Emel.  None of
these contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2007.  For 2007, PPL
Energy Supply's Statement of Income reflects losses of $7 million in "Other
income - net" and $23 million in Discontinued Operations related to these
contracts.

In 2007,
PPL Energy Supply also entered into forward contracts with PPL to sell British
pounds sterling to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in
WPD.  These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward sales
contracts entered into by PPL with third parties.  At
December 31, 2007, the total notional amount of these contracts was Â£98
million (approximately $193 million).  The market value of these
positions, representing the amount PPL Energy Supply would receive from PPL and
PPL would receive from third parties upon their termination, was $3 million and
is reflected in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss and "Price risk management assets" on the
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007.

Trademark Royalties

(PPL
Energy Supply)

A PPL
subsidiary owns PPL trademarks and bills certain affiliates for their
use.  PPL Energy Supply was allocated $39 million of this license fee
in 2007, $36 million in 2006 and $31 million in 2005.  These
allocations are primarily included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the
Statements of Income.

Transmission

(PPL Energy Supply and
PPL Electric)

PPL
Energy Supply owns no domestic transmission or distribution facilities, other
than facilities to interconnect its generation with the electric transmission
system.  Therefore, PPL EnergyPlus and other PPL Generation
subsidiaries must pay PJM, the operator of the transmission system, to deliver
the energy these subsidiaries supply to retail and wholesale customers in PPL
Electric's franchised territory in eastern and central
Pennsylvania.  PJM in turn pays PPL Electric for the use of its
transmission system.  PPL eliminates the impact of these revenues and
expenses on its consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(PPL

Management
of Market Risk Exposures

Market
risk is the potential loss PPL and PPL Energy Supply may incur as a result of
price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity
instrument.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply are exposed to market risk
from:

PPL has a
risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk
and counterparty credit risk.  The RMC, comprised of senior management
and chaired by the Vice President-Risk Management, oversees the risk management
function.  Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance
with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to,
credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices,
verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses, and daily
portfolio reporting, including open positions, mark-to-market valuations, and
other risk measurement metrics.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps
and structured deals such as tolling agreements as part of its risk management
strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity
price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility.  All derivatives
are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet
criteria for exclusion under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted.  See discussion
in "Accounting Designations" below.

Fair
Value Hedges

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into financial contracts to hedge fluctuations in the
market value of existing debt issuances, which range in maturity through 2047
for PPL and 2046 for PPL Energy Supply.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply
also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exchange rates
associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign
currencies.  These forward contracts range in maturity
through 2008.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply did not recognize significant gains or losses resulting from
hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for
2007, 2006 or 2005.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply also did not recognize
any gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges
for these years.

Cash
Flow Hedges

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical contracts, including
forwards, futures, swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated with
electric, gas, oil and other commodities.  These contracts range in
maturity through 2017.  Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter
into financial interest rate swap contracts to hedge floating interest rate risk
associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances.  These
interest rate swap contracts range in maturity through 2018.  PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge the cash
flows associated with foreign currency-denominated debt, the exchange rates
associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and the net
investment in foreign operations.  These contracts range in maturity
through 2028.

Net
investment hedge activity is reported in the foreign currency translation
adjustment component of other comprehensive income.  These contracts
range in maturity through 2011.  During 2007, PPL and PPL Energy
Supply recognized net investment hedge gains, after tax, of $2 million in other
comprehensive income.  During 2006 and 2005, PPL and PPL Energy Supply
recognized insignificant amounts in other comprehensive income (loss) related to
net investment hedge activity.  At December 31, 2007, $4 million of
accumulated net investment hedge losses, after tax, were included in the foreign
currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss compared to $6 million at December 31, 2006.

Cash flow
hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted
transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time
periods.  In certain instances, amounts previously recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to
earnings.  Such reclassifications were losses of $3 million, after
tax, in 2007, gains of $5 million, after tax, in 2006, and not significant in
2005.

For 2007,
2006 and 2005, hedge ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives was,
after tax, a loss of $3 million, a gain of $8 million and a loss of $3
million.

For 2007,
2006 and 2005, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate and foreign
currency derivatives was not significant.

Economic
Activity

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply have entered into energy derivative transactions that
economically hedge a specific risk, but do not qualify for hedge accounting
under SFAS 133.  The unrealized gains and losses on these transactions
are considered non-trading activities and are reflected on the Statements of
Income in "Wholesale energy marketing" or "Energy-related businesses" revenues,
or "Fuel" or "Energy purchases" expenses.  For 2007, the pre-tax net
gain reflected in earnings from these transactions, including the amortization
of premiums on options, was $58 million.  For 2006, the pre-tax net
loss reflected in earnings was $19 million.  The impact of these
transactions was insignificant for 2005.

The net
gain recorded for 2007 resulted primarily from a $41 million increase in
electricity positions and a $16 million increase in oil positions due to
favorable changes in market prices.  Included in the electricity
amount are gains totaling $19 million for the fair value of capacity contracts
in PJM.  This change increased income from continuing operations and
net income by $11 million ($0.03 per share, basic and diluted, for
PPL).  PJM implemented its Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in April
2007.  Prior to the RPM, PPL recorded valuation reserves for capacity
contracts due to the lack of liquidity and reliable, observable prices in the
marketplace.  With the implementation of the RPM and the completion of
PJM capacity auctions, forward capacity prices became sufficiently observable
and PPL no longer reserves for capacity contracts in PJM.

Accounting
Designations

For
energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, the circumstances and
intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine
their accounting designation, which is subsequently verified by an independent
internal group on a daily basis.  The following summarizes the
electricity guidelines that have been provided to the marketers who are
responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts in
accordance with SFAS 133.

Any
unrealized gains or losses on transactions receiving cash flow hedge treatment
to the extent they are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive
income.  These unrealized gains and losses become realized when the
contracts settle and are recognized in income when the hedged transactions
occur.

In
addition to energy-related transactions, PPL enters into financial interest rate
and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest rate and foreign currency
risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt
issuances.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply also enter into foreign currency
swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in a
foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations.  As with
energy transactions, the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the
transaction determine a contract's accounting designation, which is subsequently
verified by an independent internal group on a daily basis.  The
following is a summary of certain guidelines that have been provided to PPL's
Finance Department, which is responsible for contract designation.

Credit
Concentration

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

PPL and
its subsidiaries enter into contracts with many entities for the purchase and
sale of energy.  Many of these contracts are considered a normal part
of doing business and, as such, the fair value of these contracts is not
reflected in the financial statements.  However, the fair value of
these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit
perspective.

PPL and
its subsidiaries have credit exposure to energy trading partners.  The
majority of these exposures are the fair value of multi-year contracts for
energy sales and purchases.  Therefore, if these counterparties fail
to perform their obligations under such contracts, PPL and its subsidiaries
would not experience an immediate financial loss but would experience lower
revenues or higher costs in future years to the extent that replacement sales or
purchases could not be made at the same prices as those under the defaulted
contracts.

PPL and
its subsidiaries generally have the right to request collateral, in the forms of
cash or letters of credit, from their counterparties in the event that the
counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade or their exposure
exceeds an established credit limit.  It is also the policy of PPL and
its subsidiaries to enter into netting agreements with their counterparties to
limit credit exposure.

(PPL)

At
December 31, 2007, PPL had credit exposure of $491 million to energy trading
partners, excluding the effects of netting arrangements.  One of the
counterparties accounted for 37% of this exposure and no other individual
counterparty accounted for more than 8% of the exposure.  Ten
counterparties accounted for $344 million, or 70%, of the total
exposure.  Seven of these counterparties had an investment grade
credit rating from S&P and accounted for 37% of the top 10
exposure.  The three counterparties that are not rated investment
grade have posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit as per the terms
and conditions of their respective contracts and all three counterparties are
current on their obligations.  As a result of netting arrangements,
PPL's credit exposure was reduced to $433 million.

(PPL
Energy Supply)

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Energy Supply had credit exposure of $462 million to
energy trading partners, excluding the effects of netting
arrangements.  One of the counterparties accounted for 40% of this
exposure and no other individual counterparty accounted for more than 8% of the
exposure.  Ten counterparties accounted for $343 million or 74% of the
total exposure.  Seven of these counterparties had an investment grade
credit rating from S&P and accounted for 37% of the top 10
exposure.  The three counterparties that are not rated investment
grade have posted collateral in the form of a letter of credit as per the terms
and conditions of their respective contracts and all three counterparties are
current on their obligations.  As a result of netting arrangements,
PPL Energy Supply's credit exposure was reduced to $404 million.

PPL
Energy Supply has credit exposure to PPL Electric under the long-term contract
for PPL EnergyPlus to supply PPL Electric's PLR load.  This exposure
is excluded from the exposure discussed above.  See Note 16 for
additional information on the related party credit exposure.

(PPL
Electric)

At
December 31, 2007, PPL Electric had credit exposure of $29 million as a result
of its two solicitation bids in 2007 for the 2010 PLR supply.  The
successful bidders were six suppliers, all of which had an investment grade
credit rating from S&P.

PPL
EnergyPlus was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive
solicitation process.  PPL Electric has credit exposure to PPL Energy
Supply under the PLR contracts and the first competitive
solicitation.  These exposures are excluded from the exposure
discussed above.  See Note 16 for additional information on the
related party credit exposure.

1,154

$

1,070

In 2007,
the decrease of $108 million in the International Delivery segment reflects a
$160 million decrease due to the sale of the Latin American
businesses.  This decrease was partially offset by increases of $51
million due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $1
million tax adjustment pursuant to EITF 93-7, "Uncertainties Related to Income
Taxes in a Purchase Business Combination."  The decrease of $55
million in the Pennsylvania Delivery segment was attributable to the transfer of
goodwill associated with the natural gas distribution and propane businesses to
"Assets held for sale" on the Balance Sheet as a result of the anticipated sale
of these businesses.  See Note 10 for additional
information.

In 2006,
the increase of $84 million in the International Delivery segment was
attributable to an increase of $100 million due to the effect of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, offset by $16 million of adjustments pursuant
to EITF Issue 93-7.  The $16 million of adjustments includes a $12
million adjustment to decrease goodwill related to the transfer of WPD tax items
(see Note 5), a $9 million net increase based upon actions taken by the U.K.
taxing authority and an $8 million decrease associated with monetary indexation
of assets at WPD.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear
Decommissioning

Asset Retirement
Obligations

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

Based on
the requirements of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," PPL
and PPL Energy Supply identified various legal obligations to retire long-lived
assets, the largest of which relates to the decommissioning of the Susquehanna
plant.  PPL and PPL Energy Supply identified and recorded other AROs
related to significant interim retirements at the Susquehanna plant, and various
environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin
retirements at Susquehanna and other facilities.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," effective December
31, 2005.  FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional ARO when incurred if the fair
value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 also clarifies
when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair
value of an ARO.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply identified several conditional AROs.  The most
significant of these related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing
material at various generation plants.  The fair value of the portion
of these obligations that could be reasonably estimated was recorded at December
31, 2005, and resulted in AROs of $14 million and a cumulative effect of
adoption that decreased net income by $8 million (net of tax benefit of $6
million), or $0.02 per share for PPL.

PPL
Global identified and recorded conditional AROs that related to treated wood
poles and fluid-filled cables, which had an insignificant impact on the
financial statements.

In
addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL
and PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but were
unable to reasonably estimate their fair values.  These retirement
obligations could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement
dates.  The generation plants, where significant amounts of
asbestos-containing material are located, have been well maintained and large
capital and environmental investments are being made at these
plants.  During the previous five years, the useful lives of the
plants had been reviewed and in most cases significantly
extended.  See Note 1 for further discussion related to the extension
of the useful lives of these assets.  Due to these circumstances, PPL
management was unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of
settlement dates for the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material
at the generation plants.  If economic events or other circumstances
change that enable PPL and PPL Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair
value of these retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that
time.

PPL and
PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations that could not be
reasonably estimated at that time.  These items included requirements
associated with the retirement of a reservoir and certain transmission
assets.  These retirement obligations could not be reasonably
estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates.

The
changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were:



ARO
      at beginning of year

Accretion
      expense



New
      obligations incurred



Change

(7)

(4

)

ARO
      at end of year

$


$


Costs and
settlement dates of retirement obligations, which affect the carrying value of
AROs, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are
incorporated into the latest estimate of the obligations.  PPL and PPL
Energy Supply changed estimated settlement dates on several AROs, the most
significant being the ash basin at the Martins Creek plant in 2007 and the ash
basins at the Brunner Island and Montour plants in 2006.  In addition,
revised estimates were obtained of asbestos-containing material expected to be
remediated in future years.  The effect of these changes was to
increase the ARO liability and related plant balances by $11 million for 2007
and $14 million for 2006.  The 2007 and 2006 income statement impact
of these changes was insignificant.

(PPL
Electric)

PPL
Electric adopted FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005.  PPL Electric did
not record any AROs upon adoption of this standard.  PPL Electric
identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain
transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable
settlement dates.  These assets are located on rights-of-way that
allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the
assets.  Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the
right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may
occur.

Nuclear

Decommissioning

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

The
expected cost to decommission the Susquehanna plant is based on a 2002
site-specific study that estimated the cost to dismantle and decommission each
unit immediately following final shutdown.  PPL Susquehanna's 90%
share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna plant was
approximately $936 million measured in 2002 dollars.  This estimate
includes decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost
of removal of non-radiological structures and materials.

Beginning
in January 1999, in accordance with the PUC Final Order, approximately $130
million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from PPL Electric's
customers through the CTC over the 11-year life of the CTC rather than the
remaining life of Susquehanna.  The recovery includes a return on
unamortized decommissioning costs.  Under the power supply agreements
between PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus, these revenues are passed on to PPL
EnergyPlus.  Similarly, these revenues are passed on to PPL
Susquehanna under a power supply agreement between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL
Susquehanna.

Accrued
nuclear decommissioning expenses, as determined under the provisions of SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," were $298 million and $276
million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and are included in "Asset
retirement obligations" on the Balance Sheets.  Accretion expense, as
determined under the provisions of SFAS 143, was $22 million in 2007, $21
million in 2006 and $19 million in 2005, and is included in "Other operation and
maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

Amounts
collected from PPL Electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable
taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only be used
for future decommissioning costs.  To the extent that the actual costs
for decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds, PPL Susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the
shortfall.

In
accordance with SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," securities held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are
classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are
carried on the balance sheet at fair value.  Unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities are reported, net of tax, in other
comprehensive income or are recognized currently in earnings when a decline in
fair value is determined to be other than temporary.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" (FSP
115-1), which was effective for PPL and PPL Energy Supply beginning January 1,
2006.  Among other things, FSP 115-1 indicated that existing guidance,
particularly SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, "Other Than Temporary
Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SAB Topic 5M),
should be used to determine if a decline in a security's value is other than
temporary.  Clarification related to applying the guidance in SAB
Topic 5M has established the ability to hold an investment until it recovers its
value as a required element in determining if an individual security is other
than temporarily impaired.  Based on this clarification and as a
result of NRC requirements that nuclear decommissioning trusts be managed by
independent investment managers, with discretion to buy and sell securities in
the trusts, PPL Susquehanna has concluded that during 2007 and 2006 it was
unable to demonstrate the ability to hold an impaired security until it recovers
its value.  Accordingly, for 2007 and 2006, unrealized losses
represented other than temporary impairments, which required a current period
charge to earnings.  Unrealized gains continued to be recorded to
other comprehensive income.

In 2006,
PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $6 million ($3 million after tax,
or $0.01 per share for PPL) to reflect the cumulative impact of the
other-than-temporary impairment of affected securities.

For 2007,
PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $3 million to reflect the impact
for 2007 of the other-than-temporary impairment of affected
securities.  The impairment charge is reflected in "Other Income-net"
on PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's Statements of Income.

The
following tables show the gross unrealized gains recorded in OCI and the related
fair values for the securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds.

Variable Interest Entities

(PPL
and PPL Energy Supply)

PPL
Energy Supply is the primary beneficiary of the Lower Mt. Bethel generation
facility, and therefore consolidates this variable interest
entity.  In December 2001, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered
into a $455 million operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development,
construction and operation of a 582 MW gas-fired combined-cycle generation
facility located in Lower Mt. Bethel Township, Northampton County,
Pennsylvania.  The lessor was created for the sole purpose of owning
the facilities and incurring the related financing costs.  The initial
lease term commenced on the date of commercial operation, which occurred in May
2004, and ends in December 2013.  The lease financing, which is
included in "Long-term Debt" and "Minority Interest," is secured by, among other
things, the generation facility.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
facility had a carrying value of $441 million and $448 million, including
leasehold improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $40
million and $27 million, and was included in "Property, Plant and Equipment" and
"Other intangibles" on the Balance Sheets.

Prior to
February 2007, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, WPD LLP, held a significant
variable interest in the SIUK Capital Trust I; however it was not consolidated
because WPD LLP was not the primary beneficiary.  SIUK Capital Trust I
issued $82 million of 8.23% preferred securities maturing in February 2027 and
invested the proceeds in 8.23% Subordinated Debentures maturing in February 2027
issued by SIUK Limited.  Thus, the preferred securities were supported
by a corresponding amount of subordinated debentures.  SIUK Limited
owned all of the common securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and guaranteed all of
SIUK Capital Trust I's obligations under the preferred securities.  In
2003, SIUK Limited transferred its assets and liabilities, including the common
securities of SIUK Capital Trust I and the obligations under the subordinated
debentures, to WPD LLP. Therefore, WPD LLP guaranteed all of SIUK Capital Trust
I's obligations under the preferred securities.  In February 2007, WPD
LLP redeemed all of the 8.23% subordinated debentures due 2027 that were held by
SIUK Capital Trust I.  The SIUK Capital Trust I was formally
terminated in May 2007.  See Note 8 for a discussion of the redemption
of the Subordinated Debentures, as well as the common and preferred securities
of SIUK Capital Trust I in February 2007.  See Note 16 for a
discussion of the presentation of the related party transactions.

New Accounting Standards

(PPL,
PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric)

SFAS
141(R)

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations,"
which is known as SFAS 141(R) and replaces SFAS 141, "Business
Combinations."  PPL and its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 141(R)
prospectively, effective January 1, 2009.  The most significant
changes to business combination accounting pursuant to SFAS 141(R) includes
requirements or amendments to:

The
adoption of SFAS 141(R) will impact the accounting for business combinations for
which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009.  As noted
above, it will also impact all changes to tax uncertainties and income tax
valuation allowances established for business combinations that have occurred
prior to January 1, 2009.  Early adoption is
prohibited.  The potential impact of adoption to the financial
statements is not yet determinable but it could be material.

SFAS
157, as amended

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, "Fair Value
Measurements."  SFAS 157 provides a definition of fair value as well
as a framework for measuring fair value.  In addition, SFAS 157
expands the fair value disclosure requirements of other accounting
pronouncements to require, among other things, disclosure of the methods and
assumptions used to measure fair value as well as the earnings impact of certain
fair value measurement techniques.  SFAS 157 does not expand the use
of fair value measurements in existing accounting pronouncements.

In
February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157 through the issuance of FSP FAS 157-1,
"Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other
Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of
Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13" and FSP FAS 157-2,
"Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157."  FSP FAS 157-1 is
effective upon the initial adoption of SFAS 157 and amends SFAS 157 to exclude
from its scope, certain accounting pronouncements that address fair value
measurements associated with leases.  FSP FAS 157-2 is effective upon
issuance and delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis (at least annually).

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL and its subsidiaries will partially adopt SFAS
157, as amended, prospectively, effective January 1, 2008; limited retrospective
application for financial instruments that were previously measured at fair
value in accordance with footnote 3 of EITF Issue No. 02-3, "Issues Involved in
Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," is not expected to
be required.  The January 1, 2008 adoption of SFAS 157, as amended, is
not expected to have a significant impact on PPL and its subsidiaries; however,
the impact in periods subsequent to the adoption could be material.

As
permitted by this guidance, PPL and its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 157, as
amended, effective January 1, 2009, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis.  PPL and its subsidiaries are in the
process of evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157, as amended, for these
items.  The potential impact of this adoption is not yet determinable,
but it could be material.

SFAS

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No.
115."  SFAS 159 provides entities with an option to measure, upon
adoption of this pronouncement and at specified election dates, certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value, including available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity securities, as well as other eligible items.  The
fair value option (i) may be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with
a few exceptions, (ii) is irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs), and
(iii) is applied to an entire instrument and not to only specified risks, cash
flows, or portions of that instrument.  An entity shall report
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.

SFAS 159
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between similar assets and liabilities measured using different
attributes.  Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect the fair
value option for eligible items that exist at that date and must report the
effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 159 effective January 1, 2008.  PPL
and its subsidiaries do not plan to elect the fair value option for any existing
items; therefore, the January 1, 2008 adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to
have an impact on PPL and its subsidiaries.  However, if the fair
value option is elected for eligible items in periods subsequent to the initial
adoption, the impact could be material.

SFAS

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51."  The
objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevancy, comparability, and
transparency of the financial information an entity provides when it has a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and when it deconsolidates a
subsidiary.  SFAS 160 requires that:

PPL and
its subsidiaries will adopt SFAS 160 prospectively, effective January 1, 2009,
concurrent with the adoption of SFAS 141(R), except for the presentation and
disclosure requirements, which require retrospective application.  The
potential impact of adoption to the financial statements is not yet
determinable, but it could be material.

Quarterly
      results can vary depending on, among other things, weather and the forward
      pricing of power.  In addition, earnings in 2007 and 2006 were
      affected by special items.  Accordingly, comparisons among
      quarters of a year may not be indicative of overall trends and changes in
      operations.

PPL
      Electric's business is seasonal in nature, with peak sales periods

      items.  Accordingly, comparisons among quarters of a year may
      not be indicative of overall trends and changes in
    operations.

Approval of Fees

The Audit Committee of
PPL has procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided
by the independent auditor.  The procedures are designed to ensure the
continued independence of the independent auditor.  More specifically,
the use of the independent auditor to perform either audit or non-audit services
is prohibited unless specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee of
PPL.  As a result of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL
has established specific categories of services and authorization
levels.  All services outside of the specified categories and all
amounts exceeding the authorization levels are reviewed by the Chair of the
Audit Committee of PPL, who serves as the Committee designee to review and
approve audit and non-audit related services during the year.  A
listing of the approved audit and non-audit services is reviewed with the full
Audit Committee of PPL no later than its next meeting.

The Audit
Committee of PPL approved 100% of the 2007 and 2006 audit and non-audit related
fees.
