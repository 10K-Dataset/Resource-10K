(PPL)

Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply

In recognition of the changes in recent years in the wholesale
power markets, PPL performed an in-depth analysis of its business mix to determine the best available opportunities to maximize
the value to shareowners of its competitive generation business. As a result, in June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed
definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's
competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. The transaction
was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals from the NRC, FERC, DOJ and PUC, all of
which were received by mid-April 2015. On April 29, 2015, PPL's Board of Directors declared the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's
shareowners of record on May 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests
of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.

Immediately following the spinoff on June 1, 2015, Holdco merged
with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply. Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger,
RJS Power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy. PPL's shareowners received approximately 0.1249
shares of Talen Energy common stock for each share of PPL common stock they owned on May 20, 2015. Following completion of these
transactions, PPL shareowners owned 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%. The spinoff had no effect on the
number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding. The transaction is
intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

PPL has no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or
affiliation with Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly PPL Energy Supply).

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Acquisitions

On April 1, 2011, PPL, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary,
PPL WEM Limited, acquired all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of Central Networks East plc and Central Networks Limited,
the sole owner of Central Networks West plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred
to as Central Networks and subsequently defined herein as WPD Midlands), from subsidiaries of E.ON AG. WPD Midlands operates two
regulated distribution networks in the Midlands area of England and is included in the U.K. Regulated segment.

Segment Information

(PPL)

PPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted
in the chart above: U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated, and Pennsylvania Regulated. The U.K. Regulated segment has no related Subsidiary
Registrants. PPL's other reportable segments primarily reflect the activities of its related Subsidiary Registrants, except that
the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results
of the applicable Subsidiary Registrants. As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL no longer has a Supply
segment.

U.K. Regulated Segment

(PPL)

Consists of PPL Global which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British pound sterling into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs and allocated financing costs.

WPD, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four
of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. The number of network customers (end-users)
served by WPD totals 7.8 million across 21,600 square miles in south Wales and southwest and central England.

Revenues for the years ended December 31 are shown below.




Operating Revenues

$

2,410

$

2,621

$

2,403

The majority of WPD's operating
revenue is known as DUoS and is generated by providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy
suppliers who pay WPD for the use of WPD's distribution network to transfer electricity to the suppliers' customers, the end-users.
Throughout the following discussion, the use of the term "customers" refers to the end-users of WPD's regulated distribution
networks.

Franchise and Licenses

The operations of WPD's principal subsidiaries, WPD (South West),
WPD (South Wales), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands), are regulated by Ofgem under the direction of the Gas and Electricity
Markets Authority. The Electricity Act 1989 provides the fundamental framework of electricity companies and established licenses
that require each of the DNOs to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. WPD operates under a regulatory
year that begins April 1 and ends March 31 of each year.

WPD is authorized by Ofgem to provide electricity distribution
services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. For instance, WPD
is subject to Ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and
WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.

Ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution
license. In January 2014, Ofgem and WPD agreed to a reduction of ยฃ5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year
to be recovered in the 2016/2017 regulatory year. See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Distribution Revenue Reduction" for additional information. Ofgem has made
license changes as part of the RIIO-ED1 process discussed below.



Competition

Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the
U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. WPD's four distribution businesses
are, therefore, regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls.

Revenue and Regulation

Ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes
the amount of base demand revenue WPD can earn, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues
based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets. WPD's allowed revenue primarily
includes base demand revenue, incentive adjustments, adjustments for over or under-recovery and adjustments related to the DPCR4
line loss close out.

WPD is currently operating under the eight-year price control
period of RIIO-ED1, which commenced on April 1, 2015. The RIIO framework is intended to:

ยท

encourage DNOs to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers;

ยท

enable DNOs to finance the required investment in a timely and efficient way;

ยท

remunerate DNOs according to their delivery for customers;

ยท

increase emphasis on outputs and incentives;

ยท

enhance stakeholder engagement including network customers;

ยท

provide a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; and

ยท

replace the current Low Carbon Network Fund to continue to stimulate innovation.

Additionally, from a financial perspective the RIIO framework:

ยท

regulates revenues for the DNOs in real terms using 2012/2013 prices;

ยท

inflates RAV (therefore allowed revenues) and other revenue components using the RPI since March 31, 2013;

ยท

splits the recovery of Totex between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition
to the RAV (called "slow pot");

ยท

provides DNOs with a pass-through for costs the DNOs have no control over (i.e., Ofgem fees, National Grid transmission charges,
property taxes and corporate income taxes);

ยท

extends the recovery period of depreciation of RAV additions after April 1, 2015 from a 20 year life as used under DPCR5 to
45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually increase the asset life for new additions over the price control
period resulting in an average life of approximately 35 years for RAV additions during RIIO-ED1. The RAV as of March 31, 2015 will
continue to be depreciated over 20 years. The asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for U.S. GAAP purposes are not
the same as those used for the depreciation of the RAV in setting revenues, and as such vary by asset type and are based on the
expected useful lives of the assets;

ยท

provides the DNOs the ability to be fast-tracked through the regulatory approval process, providing a fast-track incentive
of 2.5% of Totex during the 8-year price control period for successful DNOs; and

ยท

maintains an incentive scheme for DNOs to be rewarded or penalized for performance in the areas of reliability and customer
satisfaction, but places a maximum cap on the amount of incentive revenues that can be earned by a DNO.

The key components of WPD's four RIIO-ED1 business plans accepted
by Ofgem are:

ยท

all four DNO business plans were accepted for fast-track status (fast-track incentive is worth approximately $43 million annually
for WPD assuming a $1.60/ยฃ foreign currency exchange rate);

ยท

WPD received a higher level of cost savings retention, which was established at 70% for WPD compared to approximately 55% for
slow-tracked DNOs;

ยท

a cost of debt recovery comprised of a 10-year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, compared to a transition
to a 20-year trailing average for the slow tracked DNOs applied to 65% of RAV;

ยท

a return on regulatory equity (RORE) allowance with an equity ratio of 35% of RAV and a cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared
to 6.0% for slow-tracked DNOs;

ยท

a Totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot;

ยท

recovery of approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of WPD's defined benefit pension plans; and

ยท

incentive targets that are significantly more stringent than those set under DPCR5, thus reducing the expected incentive revenues
WPD can earn in RIIO-ED1 compared to DPCR5.

WPD's combined business plans include funding for total expenditures
of approximately $20.4 billion over the eight-year period (assuming a $1.60/ยฃ foreign currency exchange rate), broken down
as follows:



ยท

Totex - $13.5 billion ($10.8 billion additions to RAV; $2.7 billion fast pot);

ยท

Pension deficit funding - $2.0 billion;

ยท

Cost of debt recovery - $1.6 billion;

ยท

Property taxes, Ofgem fees and National Grid transmissions charges - $2.6 billion; and

ยท

Corporate income taxes recovery - $700 million.

The U.K. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure
in contrast to the typical U.S. regulatory structure which operates on a cost-recovery model. The base demand revenue that a DNO
can earn in each year of the current price control period is the sum of:

ยท

a return on capital from RAV;

ยท

a return of capital from RAV (i.e. depreciation);

ยท

the fast pot recovery;

ยท

pension deficit funding;

ยท

an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a DNO is levered more
than 65% Debt/RAV;

ยท

certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control;

ยท

certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive
(also known as the rolling RAV incentive);

ยท

fast track incentive - as WPD's four DNOs were fast-tracked through the price control review process for RIIO-ED1, their base
demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above;

ยท

profiling adjustments - these adjustments do not affect the total base demand revenue in real terms over the eight-year price
control period, but change the year in which the revenue is earned;

ยท

adjustments from the Annual Iteration Process (AIP), discussed further below; and

ยท

adjustments for inflation true-ups, discussed further below.

In addition to base demand revenue, WPD's allowed revenue primarily
includes:

ยท

an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets;

ยท

adjustments for over- or under-recovery of allowed revenue; and

ยท

a reduction in revenue related to the DPCR4 line loss close out.

During DPCR5, the prior price control review period, WPD's total
base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5%
per year for all four DNOs. In the first year of RIIO-ED1, base demand revenue decreased by about 11.8% primarily due to a change
in the profiling approach and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. For each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of
RIIO-ED1, base demand revenue will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation.

As the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost
recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore,
the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition
and contingency accounting guidance.

Base Demand Revenue True-up Mechanisms

Unlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under
RIIO-ED1 will be adjusted during the price control period. The most significant of those adjustments are:

ยท

Inflation True-Up - The base demand revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set in 2012/13 prices. Therefore an inflation factor
as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base demand revenue. Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals
and affects future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the "TRU" adjustment.
The projected TRU for the 2015/16 regulatory year is a $45 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in
calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $30 million and $15 million, respectively.

ยท

Annual Iteration Process - The RIIO-ED1 price control period also includes an Annual Iteration Process (AIP). This will allow
future base demand revenues agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review to be updated during the price control
period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions and cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price
control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM).
Under the TIM, WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends.
The AIP calculates an



incremental change to base demand revenue, known as
the "MOD" adjustment. The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2016 will include the TIM for the 2015/16 regulatory year
as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to October 2016. This projected MOD of $11 million
will reduce base demand revenue for calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $5 million and $6 million, respectively.

As both MOD and TRU are changes to future base demand revenues
as determined by Ofgem, under applicable GAAP, liabilities for these adjustments have not been recorded. PPL's projected earnings
per share growth rate through 2017 includes both the estimated TRU for regulatory year 2015/16 and MOD.

Allowed Revenue Components

In addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are
added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. The most significant of these are discussed below.

Incentives - Ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide
significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. Some of
the more significant incentive mechanisms which may affect allowed revenue include:

ยท

Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS) - This incentive has two major components: (1) Customer interruptions (CIs) and (2) Customer
minutes lost (CMLs), and both are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both
the frequency and duration of power outages. The IIS target under RIIO-ED1 is divided into interruptions caused by planned and
unplanned work. The target for planned work will be calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes
lost over a previous three year period. The target for unplanned interruptions for the first year of RIIO-ED1 is specified in the
DNOs license and targets for both the CIs and CMLs become more demanding each year.

ยท

In addition to the IIS, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced in RIIO-ED1. This broad measure encompasses:

ยท

customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries;

ยท

complaints;

ยท

stakeholder engagement; and

ยท

delivery of social obligations.

The following table shows the amount of incentive revenue, primarily
from IIS, which WPD has earned during DPCR5:

Based on applicable GAAP, incentive revenues are not recorded
as assets and are included in revenues when they are billed to customers.

DPCR4 Line Loss Adjustment

For regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19 allowed revenue
will also be reduced to reflect Ofgem's final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. WPD has a liability
recorded related to this future revenue reduction and, therefore, this will not impact future earnings. See Note 6 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

Correction Factor

During the price control period, WPD's revenue is decoupled
from volume and WPD sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively
affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. Conversely,
WPD could also over-recover revenue. Over and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years,
known as the "Correction Factor" or "K-factor." Over and under-recovered amounts arising from 2014/15 onwards
and refunded/recovered under RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year). Therefore the 2014/15
over/under-recovery adjustment will occur in 2016/17. In 2016/17 under this mechanism, WPD will recover the ยฃ5 per residential
network customer reduction



given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15 (approximately $56
million) as that amount is currently considered an under-recovery.

Historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months
prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (April 1). In February 2015, Ofgem determined that, beginning for the 2017/18 regulatory
year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. Therefore, in December 2015, WPD was required to establish
tariffs for 2016/17 and 2017/18. This change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to
forecast components of allowed revenue including MOD, TRU, K-factor and incentive revenues.

Under applicable GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for
under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries. K-factor is measured as of the end of the regulatory year, March
31. While WPD estimates over-recoveries and records a liability when it is probable that there will be an over-recovered position
at the end of the regulatory-year, weather-related volume changes and other factors such as sales mix can affect the over or under-recovery
between the end of PPL's calendar year and the end of the regulatory year.

See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to U.K. Regulated
Segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the U.K. Regulated Segment.

Customers

WPD provides regulated electricity distribution services to
licensed third party energy suppliers (its customers) who use WPD's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users.
WPD bills the energy supplier for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing the end-users. Ofgem requires that all
licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement. This
agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment
obligations.

Kentucky Regulated Segment

(PPL)

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU.  In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E and KU, direct subsidiaries of LKE, are engaged in
the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee.
LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electric service to approximately
403,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides
natural gas service to approximately 322,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky.
KU provides electric service to approximately 518,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, approximately
28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, and fewer than ten customers in Tennessee, covering approximately 4,800
non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to 11 municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts.
In Virginia, KU operates under the name Old Dominion Power Company.

Details of operating revenues by customer class for the years
ended December 31 are shown below.

Franchises and Licenses

LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E
provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory
service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.

Competition

There are currently no other electric public utilities operating
within the electric service areas of LKE. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek
to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky
General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky.
The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which
may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that
implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.

Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane
and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of LKE. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to
certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural
gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability.
However, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly
from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.

Power Supply

At December 31, 2015, LKE owned, controlled or had a minority
ownership interest in generating capacity (summer rating) of 7,997 MW, of which 2,919 MW related to LG&E and 5,078 MW
related to KU, in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list
of LKE's generating facilities.

The system capacity of LKE's owned or controlled generation
is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically
to reflect changes in circumstances.

During 2015, LKE's Kentucky power plants generated the following
amounts of electricity.

(b)

This generation represents a 2.4% decrease for LKE, a 13.7% decrease for LG&E and a 6.6% increase for KU from 2014 output.

A majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was
used to supply its retail and municipal customer base.

LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with
the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after
serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E. When
KU has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail and municipal customers and its generation cost is lower than that
of LG&E, LG&E purchases electricity from KU.

See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment"
for additional information regarding LG&E's and KU's construction of a solar generating facility at the E.W. Brown generating
site. As a result of environmental requirements, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161
MW, at the Green River plant in September 2015. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired
units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit
at the Tyrone plant in 2013.

Fuel Supply

Coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E
and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Due to Cane Run Unit 7 being placed into operation during 2015, natural gas will
play a more significant role going forward. The natural gas for this generating unit is purchased using contractual arrangements
separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and
peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.

Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary
to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time
by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating
difficulties.

LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with
various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2022 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases,
as needed.

For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable
future to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Illinois. LG&E and KU continue to
purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered
to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail.

To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and
KU have secured, firm long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7 and six simple cycle combustion
turbine units located at the Trimble County site through 2024. LG&E has also secured long-term firm pipeline capacity on an
interstate pipeline for an additional simple cycle gas turbine under a power purchase agreement for the summer months through October
2018. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at Brown, no firm long-term pipeline capacity has been purchased due to the
facility being interconnected to multiple pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.

Natural gas purchases for these units currently take place
as needed from pipelines but LG&E and KU may seek to augment these purchases with longer term agreements.

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

Natural Gas Distribution Supply

Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current
working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 Bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers.
By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation
capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following
winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline
transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation
services are typically at their highest. Several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural
gas. At December 31, 2015, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $42 million.



LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms
with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions
that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability
and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.

LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services
from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2018 and 2021.
Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this
same pipeline, LG&E has two contracts with a total capacity of 10,000 MMBtu/day, during the winter season and 28,000 MMBtu/day,
during the summer season; both contracts have been terminated effective October 31, 2016. With this same pipeline, LG&E also
has a new contract for pipeline capacity commencing June 2016 through October 31, 2026, in the amount of 60,000 MMBtu/day. Additionally,
LG&E has a contract with the same pipeline for the month of January 2016 with a total capacity of 30,000 MMBtu/day. LG&E
has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons
that expires October 31, 2018.

LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas
distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas
originating in the Rockies, Marcellus and Utica production areas.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Transmission

LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority
to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent
transmission operator.

During 2013 through 2015, LG&E and KU have submitted various
compliance filings to the FERC reflecting their participation with other utilities in the Southeastern Regional Transmission Planning
group relating to certain FERC Order 1000 requirements.  FERC Order 1000, issued in July 2011, establishes certain procedural
and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional
electric transmission planning activities. FERC approvals have been received for all but one remaining of such compliance filings.

Rates

LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the
FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC, the VSCC and the TRA. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved
open access transmission tariff (OATT).

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based
on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments
and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.

KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on
rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). All regulatory assets and
liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia
base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets.

KU's Tennessee base rates are established through approval of
the TRA and generally will follow the cost of providing service in Kentucky.

KU's rates to 11 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements
are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital
less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base
utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. In April 2014, nine municipalities
submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements
contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information
on cost recovery mechanisms.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

(PPL)

Consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million
customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric also provides electricity
supply to retail customers in this area as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act.

Details of revenues by customer class for the years ended December
31 are shown below.

Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations

PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility
service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric
and companies which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the
streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance,
resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

Competition

Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face
competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive
business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.

The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved
PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent
PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.

Rates and Regulation

Transmission

PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which
operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.

PJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator
(RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission
network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to
separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same
markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the
RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive
processes outlined in the PJM tariff.



As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues
are recovered through PJM in accordance with a FERC approved tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return
on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula rate mechanism. As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases
transmission services from PJM. See "PLR" below.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information
on rate mechanisms.

Distribution

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based
on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous
additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return
is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the
DSIC are the only riders earning a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates
including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS)
requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a
portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the
PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.

Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program,
a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies
for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.

Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking
mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use
of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore,
are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of
its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. In January 2013, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting permission
to establish a DSIC. In May 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's proposed DSIC with an initial rate effective July 1, 2013, subject
to refund after hearings. The PUC also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the Office of Administrative Law
Judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision. In November 2015, the PUC issued an opinion and order approving PPL
Electric's Petition with minor modifications.

See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities"
in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129, Act 11 and other legislative and regulatory
impacts.

PLR

The Customer Choice Act requires Electric Distribution Companies
(EDCs), including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers
who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by
the PLR pursuant to PUC regulations. As of December 31, 2015, the following percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided
by competitive suppliers: 50% of residential, 85% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial
customers. The PUC continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. See "Regulatory Matters
- Pennsylvania Activities - Act 129" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a
competitive solicitation process. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2015 through May 2017,
which includes 4 solicitations for electricity supply held in April and October, annually. Pursuant to this plan, PPL Electric
contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial
and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from PPL Electric. These solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month
fixed-price load-following contracts for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing
contracts for large commercial and large industrial customers to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity
supply as a PLR.

Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation
supply in PPL Electric's service territory. Since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial
results are not impacted if its customers purchase



electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. See "Energy
Purchase Commitments" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding PPL Electric's solicitations.

See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities - Rate
Case Proceedings" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for information regarding PPL Electric's 2015 rate case proceedings.

Other Corporate Functions

(PPL)

PPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative,
management and support services.

PPL EU Services, formed in 2015, is included within the Pennsylvania
Regulated Segment and provides the majority of financial, supply chain, human resources and facilities management services to PPL
Electric. Significant portions of the various corporate functions previously within PPL Services were transferred to PPL EU Services
in 2015. Certain other functions are to be transferred to PPL EU Services as the transition services agreements with Talen Energy
expire. PPL Services will continue to provide certain limited corporate functions. For both service companies, the costs of these
services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients
based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees.

PPL Capital Funding, PPL's financing subsidiary, provides financing
for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an
enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted
credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL plans to further utilize PPL Capital Funding in future financings,
in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies.

Unlike PPL Services and PPL EU Services, PPL Capital Funding's
costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated
significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated
to the Kentucky Regulated and U.K. Regulated segments. The associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated
with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes
of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities
issuances in 2013 and beyond, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.

(All Registrants)

SEASONALITY

The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural
gas are affected by weather. As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal
basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more
pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. See "Financial
Condition - Environmental Matters" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" for additional information regarding climate change.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

See "Financial Condition" in "Item 7. Combined
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for this information.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS

See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources
- Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2016 through
2020. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures
from environmental matters.



ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing
federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental
matters. The EPA has recently issued or is in the process of proposing and finalizing numerous environmental regulations relating
to air, water and waste that will directly affect the electricity industry. See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2016-2020.
Also, see "Environmental Matters" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information. To comply with environmental
requirements, PPL's forecast for environmental capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may
be required within the next five years. Such projections are $1.9 billion for PPL and LKE ($1 billion for KU and $0.9 billion for
LG&E). Actual costs (including capital, emission allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower
or higher depending on the final compliance requirements and market conditions. PPL's and LKE's subsidiaries may also incur capital
expenditures and operating expenses, which are not now determinable, but could be significant. Environmental compliance costs incurred
by LG&E and KU are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional
information.

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS

The Registrants face various risks associated with their businesses.
Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these
risks. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 7. Combined
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 13 to the Financial Statements
for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our
businesses and financial results.

As used in this Item 1A., the terms "we," "our"
and "us" generally refer to PPL and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to the former PPL Energy Supply
and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the
Pennsylvania Regulated segment discussion, or LKE and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Kentucky Regulated
segment discussion.

(PPL)

Risks Relating to the Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and Formation
of Talen Energy Corporation

If the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply does not qualify as
a tax-free distribution under Sections 355 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), including
as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of PPL or Talen Energy, then PPL and/or its shareowners may be required to pay
substantial U.S. federal income taxes.

Among other requirements, the completion of the June 1, 2015
spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and subsequent combination with RJS Power was conditioned upon PPL's receipt of a legal opinion of
tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(D) and a tax-free
distribution pursuant to Section 355 of the Code. Although receipt of such legal opinion was a condition to completion of
the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS could reach conclusions
that are different from those in the tax opinion. If, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the IRS were to determine the
distribution to be taxable, PPL would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax
liability that could be substantial. In addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the IRS were to determine the
merger to be taxable, PPL shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be
material.

In addition, the spinoff will be taxable to PPL pursuant to
Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either PPL or Talen Energy,
directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. Because PPL's shareowners
collectively owned more than 50% of Talen Energy's common stock following the spinoff and subsequent combination, the combination
alone will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to PPL under Section 355(e) of the Code. However, Section 355(e) of the
Code might apply if acquisitions of stock of PPL before or after the spinoff, or of Talen Energy after the combination, were considered
to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. PPL is not aware of any such plan or series of
transactions that include the spinoff.

Risks related to our U.K. Segment

Our U.K. distribution business contributes a significant amount
of PPL's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the U.S., including risks associated
with changes in U.K. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the U.K. government
and the European Union. These risks may reduce the results of operations from our U.K. distribution business or affect our ability
to access U.K. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the U.S.

ยท

changes in laws or regulations relating to U.K. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws
and regulations;

ยท

changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements;

ยท

changes in general economic conditions affecting the U.K.;

ยท

regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies;

ยท

changes in labor relations;

ยท

limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors;

ยท

limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans;

ยท

changes in U.S. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings;



ยท

compliance with U.S. foreign corrupt practices laws; and

ยท

prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation.

We are subject to increased foreign currency exchange
rate risks because a majority of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our U.K. business operations.

These risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value
of the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar between the time we initially invest U.S. dollars in our U.K. businesses, and
our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the U.S. from the U.K., including cash flows
from our U.K. businesses that may be distributed to PPL or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate
purposes. In addition, PPL's consolidated reported earnings on a GAAP basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk,
which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our U.K. businesses on a British pound sterling basis to a U.S.
dollar basis in accordance with GAAP requirements.

Our U.K. segment is subject to inflationary risks.

Our U.K. distribution business is subject to the risks associated
with fluctuations in the RPI in the U.K., which is a measure of inflation.

In RIIO-ED1, WPD's base demand revenue was established by Ofgem
in 2012/13 prices. Base demand revenue is then increased by RPI for each year to arrive at the amount of revenue WPD can collect
in tariffs. The RPI is forecasted and subject to true-up in subsequent years. The fluctuations between forecasted and actual RPI
can then result in variances in base demand revenue from the business plan accepted by Ofgem. While WPD also has debt that is indexed
to RPI and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in
base demand revenue and offsets would likely affect different calendar years. Further, as RAV is also subject to increase in RPI,
a reduction in RPI could adversely affect the debt/RAV ratio together with the level of subsequent RAV amortization which is an
element of allowed revenue.

Our U.K. delivery business is subject to revenue variability
based on operational performance.

Our U.K. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based
regulatory framework. Managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the U.K. Regulated segment's
financial performance. Disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for
network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that Ofgem administers relating to customer service levels.

A failure by any of our U.K. regulated businesses to comply
with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by Ofgem that could have an adverse impact
on PPL.

Ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue
for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may
be revoked. Ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that
a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial
condition of the U.K. regulated businesses and PPL.

(PPL and LKE)

Risk Related to Registrant Holding Companies

PPL and LKE are holding companies and their cash flows
and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and PPL's ability to pay dividends, largely
depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing
and future liabilities of those subsidiaries.

PPL and LKE are holding companies and conduct their operations
primarily through subsidiaries. Substantially all of the consolidated assets of these Registrants are held by their subsidiaries.
Accordingly, these Registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as PPL's ability to pay dividends,
are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form
of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. The subsidiaries are separate legal entities and
have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. The ability
of the Registrants'



subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future
will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their
obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect
at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory
requirements, including restrictions on the ability of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to pay dividends under Section 305(a) of the
Federal Power Act.

Because PPL and LKE are holding companies, their debt and guaranty
obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. Although certain agreements
to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, PPL and LKE and their subsidiaries
retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. Therefore, PPL's and LKE's rights and the
rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the
event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors.
In addition, if PPL elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, PPL may incur U.S. income taxes, net
of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts.

(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)

Risks Related to Domestic Regulated Utility Operations

Our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same
risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the Kentucky Regulated segment and the Pennsylvania Regulated segment.
Set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks
specific to each of these segments.

The operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based
security and integrity risks.

Numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our
businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated
computer hardware and software systems. The operation of our generation plants, as well as our transmission and distribution operations,
are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive
actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could
be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses
of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation.

Our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to
recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments.
Regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged.

The rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by
one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, TRA and PUC. Although rate regulation is generally
premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance
that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which
rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our
capital investments. Federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate
requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. Although our rates are generally
regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge
may or may not match our costs at any given time. Our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital
expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. If our
costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.

Our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant
and complex governmental

regulation.

In addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal
and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including:

ยท

the terms and conditions of our service and operations;

ยท

financial and capital structure matters;

ยท

siting, construction and operation of facilities;

ยท

mandatory reliability and safety standards under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other standards of conduct;



ยท

accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies;

ยท

tax matters;

ยท

affiliate transactions;

ยท

acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and

ยท

various other matters, including energy efficiency.

Such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher
operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may
not be recoverable from customers.

Our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant
capital projects and these activities are subject

to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate
recovery of

resulting costs.

The domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive
and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of LG&E and KU) and transmission, distribution and other
infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. The completion of these projects
without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including:

ยท

approval, licensing and permitting;

ยท

land acquisition and the availability of suitable land;

ยท

skilled labor or equipment shortages;

ยท

construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors;

ยท

increases in commodity prices or labor rates;

ยท

contractor performance;

Failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget,
or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted
rate recovery by our regulators.

We are subject to the risk that our workforce and its
knowledge base may become depleted in coming years.

We are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to
the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed
personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an
increase in competition for such workers.

Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment

(

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU

)

The costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental
laws are

significant and are subject to continuing changes.

Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
are applicable to LG&E's and KU's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of
hazardous and solid wastes, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot
be predicted but could be material. In addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental
laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating
and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions.
At some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which
could cause us to retire those units. Market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. Many
of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal
producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services.

Ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their
implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties.

The environmental standards governing LG&E's and KU's businesses,
particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking
and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. Revisions to applicable
standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies,
operations or assets and



adjustments to prior plans. Depending on the extent, frequency
and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed
windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require new technologies or aggressive schedules for construction,
permitting and other regulatory approvals. Under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation
of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery
or increased costs of implementation.

We are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks
regarding certain significant developments in environmental regulation affecting coal-fired generation facilities.

Certain regulatory initiatives have been implemented or are
under development which could represent significant developments or changes in environmental regulation and compliance costs or
risk associated with the combustion of coal as occurs at LG&E's and KU's coal-fired generation facilities. In particular, such
developments include the federal Clean Power Plan regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions at existing or new power plants,
the federal Coal Combustion Residuals regulations governing coal by-product storage activities and the federal Effluent Limitations
Guidelines governing water discharge activities. Such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in generation
portfolio composition and in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods
from those historically used or currently available. Consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the
uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. Compliance with such regulations could result
in significant changes to LG&E's and KU's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures.
Such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when
compared to existing frameworks.

Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

(

PPL and PPL Electric

)

We plan to selectively pursue growth of our transmission
capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results.

We plan to pursue expansion of our transmission capacity over
the next several years. We plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission projects and capital
investments to upgrade transmission infrastructure. These types of projects involve numerous risks. With respect to the construction
or acquisition of transmission projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting,
resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive
or capable of being financed. Expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject
to applicable regulatory processes. The success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things,
upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings,
as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. If we were unable to complete construction or expansion
of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project.

We face competition for transmission projects, which could
adversely affect our rate base growth.

FERC Order 1000, issued in July 2011, establishes certain procedural
and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional
electric transmission planning activities.  The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM
transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM. Increased competition
can result in lower rate base growth.

We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related
to Pennsylvania Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs.

PPL Electric is subject to Act 129 which contains requirements
for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes PLR electricity supply procurement
rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard. The law
also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. Utilities
not meeting these Act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. Numerous factors
outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us.



We are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental
contamination at facilities owned or operated by PPL Electric or its former subsidiaries.

We may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental
remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether
the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. We also have current or previous ownership
interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to
investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. Remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant
operations are one source of such costs. Citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including
claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement
of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. We cannot predict
the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental
matters, although they could be material.

Risks Related to All Segments

(

All Registrants

)

Increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy,
can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed
generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business.

Energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels
of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes
in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy
efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. This focus on conservation,
energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could in turn adversely affect our business.

We could be negatively affected by rising interest rates,
downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital
markets.

In the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate
long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. As a capital-intensive
business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements,
market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes.
Changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect
our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt.

Credit ratings assigned by Moody's and S&P to our businesses
and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. A ratings downgrade
could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term
debt at acceptable interest rates. See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ratings Triggers" for additional information
on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings.

Disruption in financial markets could adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and access to
capital, among other things, for financing capital expenditures. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and Basel III
in Europe may impose costly additional requirements on the businesses of others with whom we contract, such as banks or other counterparties,
or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of
our businesses is dependent.

Our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis,
especially as a result of extreme weather conditions.

Our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. For example,
in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks
occur in cold winter months. As a result, our



overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal
basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. The patterns of
these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities.

Operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions,
including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental

disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters.

Weather and these other factors can significantly affect our
profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. Storm outages and
damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs.

Our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic
risks relating to potential

effects of climate change.

Climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental
conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the
potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events,
could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. These or other
meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. Greenhouse gas regulation
could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive
effect on regional economies. Reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain
industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and
deliver. Also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring
energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.

We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings
and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. An adverse determination
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation
and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are
summarized in "Federal Matters" in Note 6 and "Legal Matters," "Regulatory Issues" and "Environmental
Matters - Domestic" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can
we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case.

Significant increases in our operation and maintenance
expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity.

We continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation
and maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. Increased costs of
materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental
regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining
agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees
and retirees. We provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. These benefits give rise to significant expenses.
Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced
significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage,
to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher
portion of the costs of their health care benefits. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect
to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. The measurement of our expected future health care and pension
obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our
control. These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements,
salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash
contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly.

We may be required to record impairment charges in the
future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings.

Under GAAP, we are required to test our recorded goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that
these assets may be impaired. Although no



impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the
fourth quarter of 2015, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary.

We also review our long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible
assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets
may not be recoverable. Although no impairment charges have been recorded related to the Company's continuing operations during
the reporting periods, we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses,
may occur in future years.

We may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued
operations.

In connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions,
we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. These indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things,
to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and
to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in
connection with the divestiture. See "Guarantees and Other Assurances" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements.

We are subject to liability risks relating to our generation,

transmission and distribution operations.

The conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects
us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees,
customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties.

Our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase
our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance.

Operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities,
information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure
of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence,
delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. These events may impact
our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. Operation of our delivery systems
below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable
from customers. Planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices
to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them.

Although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain
of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses
occur.

We are subject to risks associated with federal and state
tax laws and regulations.

Changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying
potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. We are required to make judgments
in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and
franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. We also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits.
Due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or
considered. We cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such
changes on our businesses. If enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our
results of operations and cash flows.

We are required to obtain, and to comply with, government
permits and approvals.

We are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits,
approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be
lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which
the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial,
revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals,
or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations
and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. Although various
regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide
adequate



financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative
or regulatory action.

Our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits
and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. In addition, new
environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical
routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the possible imposition
of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain
additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows
and financial condition.

War, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

War, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue
to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices
for oil and gas. In addition, unrest in the Middle East could lead to acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, and
acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. Armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our
markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. In addition, we may incur increased costs
for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist
incident.

We are subject to counterparty performance, credit or
other risk in their provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or
conduct business activities.

We purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel,
natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or
services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. Delivery of these
goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties
and also the markets, infrastructure or third-parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. As a result, we are subject
to the risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable
or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. Such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to
operate our facilities or deliver our services and collect our revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs
and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. The performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased
counterparty risk to LKE, LG&E and KU currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. The coal industry is subject
to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including greenhouse
gases or other air emissions, combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. Consequently, the coal industry faces raised
production costs or closed customer markets.

Overview

For a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see
"Item 1. Business."

In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive
agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive
power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On June 1, 2015, the spinoff
was completed. See "Financial and Operational Developments - Other Financial and Operational Developments - Spinoff of PPL
Energy Supply" below for additional information.

Business Strategy

(All Registrants)

Following the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL
completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model consisting of seven diverse, high-performing utilities.
These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and
customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will
create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.



PPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan
to achieve this growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive
regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth
in rate base and RAV, as applicable, driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve
system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired
electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through 2020 at PPL Electric.

For the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital
project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test
years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory
lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause
and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate,
prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the
construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital
outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition.  Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost
recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of
the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative for addressing the need.  In Pennsylvania,
the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory
lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs.

Although rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected
to result in strong earnings growth for the foreseeable future, PPL does not expect significant earnings growth from the U.K. Regulated
segment under the RIIO-ED1 price control period, which began on April 1, 2015. Although the U.K. Regulated segment also projects
strong RAV growth, earnings from this segment are expected to be relatively flat from 2015 to 2017 during the transition to RIIO-ED1.
Higher revenues resulting from the fast-track bonus are partially offset by higher levels of revenue profiling in the prior price
control period (DPCR5) and a lower return on regulatory equity. In addition, starting in 2017, the amount of incentive revenues
WPD is able to earn is expected to decline as a result of more stringent reliability and customer service targets established by
Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. See "Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional
information on revenues under RIIO-ED1.

To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and
to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate
liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things,
are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such
as forwards, options, and swaps.

As discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to
maintain constructive relationships with our regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and
state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to our customers, regulators and
shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and efficiency of
operations.

(PPL)

Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to
foreign currency translation risk. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their
U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency
swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.

Following the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL
has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly, PPL Energy Supply).

See "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors"
and "Financial and Operational Developments - Other Financial and Operational Developments - Cost of Spinoff" and "Loss
on Spinoff" below for additional information.

2014 and 2013 were adjusted to include costs that were previously allocated to the Supply segment that would remain with PPL
after the completion of the transaction, if left unmitigated. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Reconciliation of Earnings
from Ongoing Operations" below for an itemization of special items impacting Corporate and Other.

(b)

Costs were lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the benefits of corporate restructuring. Costs were higher in
2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense.

definition of Earnings from Ongoing Operations as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income.

See "Results of Operations" below for further discussion
of PPL's results of operations, details of special items by reportable segments and analysis of the consolidated results of operations.

2016 Outlook

(PPL)

Excluding special items, higher earnings are expected in 2016
compared with 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments.
The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and
the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.

(PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment)

Excluding special items, relatively flat earnings are projected
in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher financing costs, depreciation expense, currency, taxes and other expenses, partially
offset by lower operation and maintenance expense, including pension expense, and higher gross margins. The 2016 foreign currency
exposure for this segment is 95% hedged at an average rate of $1.56 per pound.

(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU)

Excluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016
compared with 2015, primarily driven by electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional
environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher financing costs.



(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)

Excluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016
compared with 2015, primarily driven by a distribution base rate increase effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins,
partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher financing costs and a benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross
receipts tax reserve.

(PPL's Corporate and Other Category)

Excluding special items, costs are projected to be relatively
flat in 2016 compared with 2015.

(All Registrants)

Earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and
uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the
rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1, 6 and 13 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties
and factors that may impact future earnings.

Other Financial
and Operational Developments

Regulatory Requirements

(

PPL,
LKE, LG&E and KU)

The businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive
federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs, MATS and the
Clean Power Plan. See "Financial Condition - Environmental Matters" below for additional information on the CCRs requirements
and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the other significant environmental matters. These and other stringent
environmental requirements have led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 megawatts of coal-fired generating plants
in Kentucky. In September 2015, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161 MW, at the Green
River plant. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined summer
capacity rating of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in 2013.
The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of
PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU.

Also as a result of the environmental requirements discussed
above, LKE projects $1.9 billion ($1.0 billion at KU and $0.9 billion at LG&E) in environmental capital investment over the
next five years. See PPL's "Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures", Note 6 and Note 13
for additional information.

Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply

In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive
agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive
power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. In June 2015, the spinoff was
completed. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information relating to the transaction.

Loss on Spinoff

In conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated
whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.

PPL considered several valuation methodologies to derive a fair
value estimate of its Supply segment at the spinoff date. These methodologies included considering the closing "when-issued"
Talen Energy market value on June 1, 2015 (the spinoff



date) adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value
attributable to the Supply segment, as well as the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments
- an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering
market multiples of comparable companies.

Although the market value of Talen Energy approach utilized
the most observable inputs of the three approaches, PPL considered certain limitations of the "when-issued" trading market
for the spinoff transaction including the short trading duration, lack of liquidity in the market and anticipated initial Talen
stock ownership base selling pressure, among other factors, and concluded that these factors limit the appropriateness of this
input being solely determinative of the fair value of the Supply segment. As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches
in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach.

The following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:

A key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the
application of a control premium of 25% in the two market approaches. PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium
in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply
segment, which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This guidance provides that the market price of an individual security
(and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publically traded equity securities) may not be representative of
the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder
from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that arise from control over another entity, and that the market
price of a Company's individual share of stock does not reflect this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore,
the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for determining the fair value, and including a control premium
is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit.

In determining the control premium, PPL reviewed premiums received
during the last five years in market sales transactions obtained from observable independent power producer and hybrid utility
transactions greater than $1 billion. Premiums for these transactions ranged from 5% to 42% with a median of approximately 25%.
Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of 25% to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.

Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included
forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions
used in the Energy Supply portion of the recent Talen Energy business planning process and a market participant discount rate.

Using these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the
estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of $4.1 billion and recorded a
loss on the spinoff of $879 million in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible
for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff
date.

Costs of Spinoff

Following the announcement of the transaction to form Talen
Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following
completion of the spinoff. Organizational plans were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identified the
need to resize and restructure the organizations and as a result, in 2014, estimated charges of $36 million for employee separation
benefits were recorded related to 306 positions. Of this amount, $16 million related to 112 Energy Supply positions and is reflected
in discontinued operations. The remaining $20 million is primarily reflected in "Other operation and maintenance" on
the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2015, the organizational structures were finalized for both PPL and Talen Energy
which resulted in an additional charge of $10 million for employee separation benefits. Of this amount, $2 million related to Energy
Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $8 million is reflected in "Other operation and
maintenance" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. The separation benefits include cash severance compensation, lump
sum COBRA reimbursement payments and outplacement services. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the recorded



liabilities related to the separation benefits were $13 million
and $20 million, which are included in "Other current liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.

Additional employee-related costs incurred primarily included
accelerated stock-based compensation and prorated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily
for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL Services employees who became PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction.
PPL Energy Supply recognized $24 million of these costs at the spinoff closing date in 2015, which are reflected in discontinued
operations.

PPL recorded $45 million and $27 million of third-party costs
related to this transaction in 2015 and 2014. Of these costs, $32 million and $19 million were primarily for bank advisory, legal
and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are reflected in discontinued operations. An additional $13 million and
$8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred in 2015 and 2014, related to the formation of the Talen Energy organization
and to reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions. These costs are recorded primarily in "Other operation and maintenance"
on the Statements of Income. No significant additional third-party costs are expected to be incurred.

At the close of the transaction in 2015, $72 million ($42
million after-tax) of cash flow hedges, primarily unamortized losses on PPL interest rate swaps recorded in AOCI and
designated as cash flow hedges of PPL Energy Supply's future interest payments, were reclassified into interest expense and
reflected in discontinued operations.

As a result of the June 2014 spinoff announcement, PPL recorded
$50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net
operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.

Discontinued Operations

The operations of PPL's Supply segment are included in "Income
(Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the Statements of Income.

The assets and liabilities of PPL's Supply segment for all periods
prior to the spinoff are included in "Current assets of discontinued operations", "Noncurrent assets of discontinued
operations", "Current liabilities of discontinued operations" and "Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations"
on PPL's Balance Sheet.

Net assets, after recognition of the loss on spinoff, of $3.2
billion were distributed to PPL shareowners in the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information
related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.

RIIO-ED1

On April 1, 2015, the RIIO-ED1 eight-year price control period
commenced for WPD's four DNOs. In February 2014, Ofgem published formal confirmation that WPD's Business Plans submitted by its
four DNOs under RIIO-ED1 were accepted as submitted, or "fast-tracked." Fast tracking afforded several benefits to the
WPD DNOs including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of Totex during the eight-year price control period
(approximately $43 million annually), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention. See "Item 1.
Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on RIIO-ED1.

U.K. Depreciation

Effective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the
useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from
55 years for GAAP reporting of depreciation expense. For 2015, this change in useful lives resulted in lower depreciation expense
of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).



U.K. Distribution Revenue Reduction

In December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs announced agreements
with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of ยฃ5 per residential customer of electricity
distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of
the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost will occur in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2016. Under
GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under recovery of regulated income (which this reduction represents), as a result earnings
for the U.K. Regulated segment were adversely affected by $15 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014. PPL projects earnings in
2016 will be positively affected by $32 million and earnings for 2017 will be positively affected by $17 million.

U.K. Tax Rate Change

In November 2015, the U.K. Summer 2015 Budget was enacted, which
reduces the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020.
As a result of these changes, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately
$90 million (4% effective tax rate impact) in 2015.

Discount Rate Change for U.K. Pension Plans

In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD
historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD will begin
using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined
benefit cost. Based on current estimates, PPL expects this change to reduce net periodic defined benefit costs by $44 million ($36
million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2016. Assuming interest rates continue to rise, the benefit is highest in the initial
year and then falls over time as the additional actuarial losses on liabilities are amortized. See "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies-Defined Benefits" for additional information.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Rate Case Proceedings

On March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC
to increase its annual distribution revenue requirement by approximately $167.5 million.  The application is based on a fully
projected future test year of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On September 3, 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC
Administrative Law Judge a petition for approval of a settlement agreement resolving all issues in the case. On November 19, 2015,
the PUC issued its final order approving the settlement agreement. Under that agreement, PPL Electric was permitted to increase
its annual distribution rates by $124 million, effective January 1, 2016.

On March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting
a waiver of the DSIC cap of 5% of billed revenues and approval to increase the maximum allowable DSIC from 5% to 7.5% for service
rendered after January 1, 2016. PPL Electric filed the petition concurrently with its 2015 rate case and the Administrative Law
Judge granted PPL Electric's request to consolidate these two proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed
above, PPL Electric agreed to withdraw the petition without prejudice to filing it at a later date.

Regional Transmission Expansion Plan

In July 2014, PPL Electric announced Project Compass, a
proposal to construct a new multi-state transmission line. On October 27, 2015, PPL Electric filed an interconnection
application with the New York Independent System Operator for the first segment of the project which contains a proposed
95-mile, $500 million to $600 million line between Blakely, Pennsylvania, and Ramapo, New York. The proposed line is intended
to provide significant economic benefits for electricity customers in New York and also to provide grid reliability and grid
security benefits for electricity customers in both states. The construction is proposed to begin in 2019 and be in operation
by 2023. There will be numerous approvals required, including, among others, the public utility commissions of Pennsylvania
and New York, the New York Independent System Operator, PJM, and FERC. As originally proposed in 2014, Project Compass would
have run from western Pennsylvania into New York and New Jersey and also south into Maryland, covering approximately 725
miles at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $6 billion. The project has been revised to include about 475 miles of
transmission line in Pennsylvania and New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. Beyond this segment, no schedule is proposed for the rest of the project.
There can be no assurance that this segment of Project Compass will be approved as proposed. Additionally, PPL Electric
is



continuing to study the project and may modify it in the
future. The capital expenditures related to this project are excluded from the Capital Expenditures table included in
"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Forecasted Uses of Cash" below.

FERC
Wholesale Formula Rates

(LKE and KU)

In September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to
adjust the formula rate under which KU provided wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers.  Among other
changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual
costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up.  KU's application proposed an authorized return on
equity of 10.7%.  Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund. 
In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking
power under the wholesale requirements contracts.  Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one
municipality with a 2017 effective date.  In addition, a tenth municipality has become a transmission-only customer as of
June 2015.  In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination
notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its approval.  In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the
interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order.  During the fourth quarter
of 2015, the FERC approved the settlement agreement resolving the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including
approval of the formula rate with a true-up provision and authorizing a return on equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded
to other parties in this case, whichever is lower.  In August 2015, KU filed a partial settlement agreement with the nine
terminating municipalities, resolving all but one open matter with one municipality.  The settlement was approved by FERC
in the fourth quarter of 2015, including authorizing the agreed-upon refunds, approving the formula rate with a true-up provision,
and authorizing a 10.25% return on equity.  Refunds to both the remaining municipals and the departing municipals were issued
during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $3.4 million.  A single remaining unresolved issue with one terminating municipality
is in FERC litigation proceedings.  Hearings on the dispute were conducted in January 2016 and preliminary rulings on the
matter may occur in mid- or late-2016. KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this remaining FERC proceeding, but the amounts
under continuing dispute are not estimated to be significant.

Rate
Case Proceedings

(LKE, LG&E and KU)

On June 30, 2015, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement
providing for increases in the annual revenue requirements associated with KU base electricity rates of $125 million and LG&E
base gas rates of $7 million. The annual revenue requirement associated with base electricity rates at LG&E was not changed.
Although the settlement did not establish a specific return on equity with respect to the base rates, an authorized 10% return
on equity will be utilized in the ECR and GLT mechanisms. The settlement agreement provides for deferred recovery of costs associated
with KU's retirement of Green River Units 3 and 4. The new regulatory asset will be amortized over three years. The settlement
also provides regulatory asset treatment for the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with LG&E and
KU's pension accounting policy and pension expense using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses. The new
rates and all elements of the settlement became effective July 1, 2015.

On June 30, 2015, KU filed an application with the VSCC to
increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by approximately $7 million, representing an increase of 10.1%. On December
3, 2015, KU and other parties filed a proposed settlement with the VSCC. On February 2, 2016, the VSCC issued an order
approving the settlement. The settlement provides for annual electric base revenues of $6 million and establishes an
authorized return on equity range of 9.5% to 10.5% for annual rate review purposes. The new rates became effective February
15, 2016.

ยท

Higher other operation and maintenance

in 2015 compared
with 2014 primarily due to $14 million of higher pension expense and $11 million of higher costs related to the Cane Run units'
retirements consisting of an inventory write-down and separation benefits, partially offset by $7 million of lower storm costs
and lower bad debt expense of $6 million.

ยท

Higher other operation and maintenance

in 2014 compared
with 2013 primarily due to $14 million of higher expenses due to the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages,
$9 million of higher bad debt expense and higher storm expenses of $8 million.



ยท

Higher depreciation in 2014 compared with 2013 due to additions to PP&E, net.

ยท

Higher interest expense

in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily
due to the issuance of $550 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds by LG&E and KU in September 2015 and higher interest
rates on $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by LG&E and KU.

ยท

Higher interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $22 million of higher expense resulting from the issuance
of $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013 and higher short-term debt balances partially offset by a $10 million
loss on extinguishment of debt in 2013 related to the remarketing of the PPL Capital Funding Junior Subordinated Notes component
of the 2010 Equity Units and simultaneous exchange into Senior Notes in the second quarter of 2013, and a $5 million decrease due
to lower rates on the related Senior Notes as compared with the Junior Subordinated Notes.

ยท

Higher income taxes in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity
transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 16% of PPL's Income from
Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 22% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.

Margins.

ยท

Higher other operation and maintenance for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $30 million of higher corporate service
costs allocated to PPL Electric, $11 million of higher vegetation management expenses and related costs for additional work done
by outside vendors and $5 million of higher bad debt expenses.

ยท

Lower other operation and maintenance for 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $16 million of lower payroll related expenses
due to lower headcount, less maintenance projects and more focus on capital work in 2014.

ยท

Higher depreciation for both periods primarily due to transmission and distribution additions to PP&E, net, related to
the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure.

ยท

Higher interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in July 2013 and June
2014.

ยท

Lower taxes, other than income for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit
resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves.

ยท

Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher pre-tax income which increased income taxes by $46
million and tax benefits related to federal and state income tax reserves of $8 million in 2013.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management's Discussion and Analysis includes financial information
prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures including "Earnings from Ongoing Operations"
and "Gross Margins" as further described below.

Earnings from Ongoing Operations

Management utilizes "Earnings from Ongoing Operations"
as a non-GAAP financial measure and it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating
performance determined in accordance with GAAP.  PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful
to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's fundamental earnings performance as another criterion in making investment
decisions. PPL's management also uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring certain corporate performance goals. Other
companies may use different measures to present financial performance.  Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the
impact of special items as described below, which for all years includes the Supply segment's earnings now reflected in discontinued
operations.  Also included in special items in 2015 is the loss on spinoff, reflecting the fair value of the Supply segment
being less than PPL's recorded value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff.  Earnings from Ongoing Operations for 2014 and 2013 also
reflects, within the Corporate and Other category, the impact of spinoff dissynergies that, if not mitigated, would remain with
PPL after completion of the spinoff.



Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact
of special items. Special items include:

โข Unrealized gains or losses on foreign
currency-related economic hedges.

โข Supply segment discontinued operations.

โข Gains and losses on sales of assets
not in the ordinary course of business.

โข Impairment charges.

โข Workforce reduction and other restructuring
effects.

โข Acquisition and divestiture-related
adjustments.

โข Other charges or credits that are,
in management's view, not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.

Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations

The following tables contain after-tax gains (losses), in total,
which management considers special items, that are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations and a reconciliation to PPL's
"Net Income (Loss)" for the years ended December 31.

Margins

Management also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures
as indicators of performance for its businesses.

ยท

"U.K. Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the
U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as National Grid connection charges and Ofgem license fees
(recorded in "Other operations and maintenance expense" on the Statement of Income) are deducted from operating revenues
as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity
across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities.

ยท

"Kentucky Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and
distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, LKE, LG&E and KU, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's
and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs
of production (recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues.
In addition, certain other expenses, recorded as "Other operation and maintenance", "Depreciation" and "Taxes,
other than income" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery
of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases,
returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity
and gas operations.

ยท

"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and
distribution delivery operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and PPL Electric. In calculating this measure, utility revenues
and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on
earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance,"
(which are primarily Act 129 and Universal Service program costs), and "Taxes, other than income," which is primarily
gross receipts tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected
in "Energy purchases from affiliate" in the reconciliation tables. As a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy
Supply and the formation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric.
PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are reflected in "Energy Purchases" in
the reconciliation tables. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's
electricity delivery operations.



These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income,"
which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different
measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria
to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management
and PPL's Board of Directors to manage the operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.

Reconciliation of Margins

The following tables contain the components from the Statement
of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's "Operating Income" for the

U.K. Gross Margins

U.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $171 million from the April 1, 2015 price decrease
resulting from the commencement of RIIO-ED1, partially offset by $46 million from the April 1, 2014 price increase.

U.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $194 million from the April 1, 2014 and 2013 price
increases, partially offset by $88 million from lower volumes due primarily to weather.

Kentucky Gross Margins

Kentucky Gross Margins increased in 2015 compared with 2014,
primarily due to higher base rates of $64 million ($61 million at KU and $3 million at LG&E) and returns on additional environmental
capital investments of $53 million ($36 million at LG&E and $17 million at KU). The increases in base rates were the result
of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in volumes of $28
million ($23 million at KU and $5 million at LG&E) primarily due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Kentucky Gross Margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013,
primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments of $55 million ($27 million at LG&E and $28 million
at KU) and higher volumes of $13 million ($5 million at LG&E and $8 million at KU). The change in volumes was driven by unusually
cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.

Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins

Distribution

Distribution margins increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily
due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $17 million partially offset by a $12 million benefit
recorded in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.

Distribution margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily
due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $18 million and a $12 million benefit from a change
in estimate of a regulatory liability.

Transmission

Transmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due
to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing the aging infrastructure and improving reliability.

in 2014.

(d)

The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to more storm events.

(e)

The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to the corporate costs allocated to PPL Energy Supply (and included in discontinued
operations) prior to the spin. As a result of the spinoff on June 1, 2015, these corporate costs now remain in continuing operations.

debt that was previously associated with PPL's Supply segment and included in "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations
(net of income taxes) in 2014.

The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to debt issuances at WPD (West Midlands) in October 2013, LG&E
and KU in November 2013 and PPL Electric in June 2014 and July 2013.

(b)

In March 2014, a $9 million loss was recorded related to PPL Capital Funding's remarketing and debt exchange of the junior

tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire as a result of lower future taxable earnings due to the extension of bonus
depreciation.

As a result of the PPL Energy Supply spinoff announcement,
PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense during 2014 to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily
for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply. See Note
8 for additional information on the spinoff.

During 2013, PPL recorded $23 million of state deferred
income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income
at PPL Energy Supply over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses.

(b)

Changes in state apportionment resulted in reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2014, and an increase
to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2013. PPL recorded an insignificant deferred tax benefit in 2014 and a $15
million deferred tax expense in 2013 related to its state deferred tax liabilities.

(c)

During 2015, PPL recorded a $12 million tax benefit related to the settlement of the IRS audit for the tax years 1998-2011.

In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the December 2011 ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, concerning
the creditability of U.K. Windfall Profits Tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of this decision, PPL recorded
a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013
to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related
to stranded costs securitization was zero.

(d)

During 2015, PPL recorded lower income taxes primarily due to a decrease in taxable dividends.

During 2014, PPL recorded $47 million of income tax expense primarily attributable to taxable dividends.

During 2013, PPL recorded $28 million of income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million
income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits
that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return.

(e)

The U.K.'s Finance Act 2015, enacted in November 2015, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective
April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized
a $90 million deferred tax benefit in 2015 related to both rate decreases.

The U.K.'s Finance Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective April
1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective April 1, 2015. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a
$97 million deferred tax benefit in 2013 related to both rate decreases.

See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information
on income taxes.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income
taxes)

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)
for all periods presented, primarily includes the results of operations of PPL Energy Supply, which was spun off from PPL on June
1, 2015 and substantially represents PPL's former Supply segment. See "Discontinued Operations" in Note 8 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

Excluding a special item, earnings decreased for 2015
compared with 2014 primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense, partially
offset by returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments and the release of a gross
receipts tax reserve.

Excluding a special item, earnings increased in 2014 compared
with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments, lower other operation

The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to higher corporate support costs charged to Electric Utilities, primarily
as a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.

(c)

The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to more storm events.

Depreciation

Depreciation increased by $29 million in 2015 compared with
2014, and by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to additions to PP&E, net, related to the ongoing efforts
to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure.

Taxes, Other Than Income

Taxes, other than income decreased by $13 million in 2015 compared
with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously
recognized reserves.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased by $8 million in 2015 compared with
2014, primarily due to debt issuances in October 2015 and June 2014. Interest expense increased by $14 million in 2014 compared
with 2013, primarily due to debt issuances in June 2014 and July 2013.

Special items, gains (losses), after-tax

Excluding special items, earnings increased in 2015 compared
with 2014 primarily due to higher base rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher
other operation and maintenance expense, income taxes, financing costs and lower sales volume. The increases in base rates were
the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume was due to milder weather during
the fourth quarter of 2015.

Earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased primarily due
to higher other operation and maintenance expense driven by the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, higher
bad debt expense, storm-related expenses, higher financing costs and higher depreciation expense partially offset by returns on
additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volumes. The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold
weather in the first quarter of 2014.

(PPL)

PPL had a $669 million decrease in cash from operating activities
from continuing operations in 2015 compared with 2014.

ยท

Net income improved by $166 million between the periods, but included a decrease in net non-cash charges of $280 million. These
net non-cash charges included a $238 million decrease in deferred income taxes and $65 million of changes to the WPD line loss
accrual. These decreases in non-cash charges were partially offset by $110 million of lower unrealized gains on hedging activities.
The net $114 million decrease from net income and non-cash adjustments between the periods was primarily due to lower margins from
the U.K. Regulated segment, partially offset by higher margins from the Kentucky and Pennsylvania Regulated segments.

ยท

The $341 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily
due to a decrease in current income tax expense in 2015), a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due



to timing of fuel purchases and payments and unfavorable
weather in 2015) partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to unfavorable weather in 2015).

ยท

The $99 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was primarily due to payments of $101 million for the
settlement in 2015 of forward starting interest rate swaps.

PPL had a $494 million increase in cash provided by operating
activities from continuing operations in 2014 compared with 2013.

ยท

Net income improved by $69 million between the periods. This included an additional $124 million of net non-cash charges, including
a $279 million increase in deferred income tax expense. These non-cash charges were partially offset by $243 million of higher
unrealized gains on hedging activities.

ยท

The $438 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was partially due to an increase in taxes payable (primarily
due an increase in current income tax expense in 2014), a change in uncertain tax positions between the periods and lower growth
in accounts receivable and a decline in unbilled revenue.

ยท

The $166 million decrease in cash from other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for settlement
in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps.

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric had an $11 million decrease in cash provided by
operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.

ยท

Net income decreased by $11 million between the periods and included an additional $181 million of net non-cash charges, primarily
due to increases in deferred tax expense and depreciation.

ยท

The $148 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was partially due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily
due an increase in current income tax benefits in 2015) and a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to milder weather and
lower energy prices in December 2015), partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to milder weather in
2015, improved collection performance and higher write-offs).

ยท

Pension funding was $10 million higher in 2015.

PPL Electric had a $90 million increase in cash provided by
operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.

ยท

Net income improved by $54 million between the periods. However, this included an additional $53 million of net non-cash benefits,
primarily due to a decrease in deferred income tax expense.

ยท

Pension funding was $70 million lower in 2014.

(LKE)

LKE had a $64 million increase in cash provided by operating
activities in 2015 compared with 2014.

ยท

LKE's non-cash components of net income included a $213 million decrease in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $28
million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. Deferred income taxes were lower in 2015 as a large
portion of the effect of accelerated tax depreciation did not result in cash as a result of the Federal net operating losses.

ยท

The increase in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in income tax receivable as a
                                                                                                               result                                                                                                                of

                                                                                                               receivable and unbilled revenues due to milder weather in December 2015, a decrease in coal inventory as a result of plant
                                                                                                               retirements, and a decrease in natural gas stored underground due to lower gas prices in 2015, partially offset by a
                                                                                                               decrease                                                                                                                in

ยท

The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $88 million in payments for the settlement
of interest rate swaps.

LKE had a $79 million increase in cash provided by operating
activities in 2014 compared with 2013.

ยท

LKE's non-cash components of net income included a $195 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to an increase
in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014.

ยท

The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable and a decrease of income
tax payable from PPL as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in inventory due to increased
coal purchases in anticipation of a cold December similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable
and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013.

ยท

The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement
of interest rate swaps received in 2013.



(LG&E)

LG&E had a $183 million increase in cash provided by operating
activities in 2015 compared with 2014.

coal purchases in anticipation of a cold December similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable
and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013 and an increase in accounts
payable to affiliates.

ยท

The decrease in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement
of interest rate swaps received in 2013.

(PPL)

For PPL, lower project expenditures at WPD and KU were partially
offset by higher project expenditures at PPL Electric and LG&E. The decrease in expenditures for WPD was primarily due to a
decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability associated with the end of the DPCR5 price control period and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for KU was related to lower expenditures for the construction of
Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower expenditures for environmental air projects
and CCR projects at KU's Ghent and E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to the Northeast
Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland
transmission project. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects at LG&E's Mill
Creek plant, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.

PPL received $136 million during 2015 from the sale of short-term
investments.

For PPL, in 2014 compared with 2013, the increase in "Expenditures
for PP&E" was partially due to expenditures made in 2014 at WPD (primarily due to projects to enhance system reliability
and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates) partially offset by expenditures made in 2013 for the construction of Cane Run
Unit 7 for both LG&E and KU.

PPL paid $120 million during 2014 from the purchase of short-term
investments.

(PPL Electric)

For PPL Electric, in 2015 compared with 2014, the increase in
expenditures was primarily due to the Northeast Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially
offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project.

The changes in "Notes receivable with affiliates, net"
resulted from proceeds of $150 million received in 2014 from repayments on a note extended in 2013.

(LKE)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing
activities increased as a result of receiving payment from PPL in 2014 for the notes receivable issued in 2013, partially
offset by lower PP&E



expenditures. An increase in expenditures for LG&E was
primarily due to higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower
expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7. A decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily due to lower
expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower
expenditures for environmental air projects and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants.

In comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities
decreased as a result of the decrease in PP&E expenditures for KU, partially offset by the increase in PP&E expenditures
for LG&E. The decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7
and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants, partially offset by higher expenditures for environmental air projects
at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects
at the Mill Creek plant and the gas service riser program, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane
Run Unit 7.

(LG&E)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities
increased primarily due to higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower
expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015.

In comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities

(KU)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities

(PPL)

In 2015, PPL required $220 million additional cash from financing
activities including the WPD, LG&E and KU long-term debt issuances in 2015, partially offset by lower common stock issuances
in 2015.

In 2014, PPL required $2.5 billion less cash from financing
activities including the PPL Capital Funding and WPD long-term debt issuances in 2014, lower common stock issuances in 2014 and
improvements in cash from operations of $494 million which helped support the significant capital expenditure programs of its subsidiaries.

In 2014, financing activities also included net cash distributions
of $1.2 billion to PPL from PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) for the proceeds from the PPL Montana hydroelectric generation
facilities sale, net of a tax liability payment and proceeds from a tax grant.

In 2013, financing activities also included net cash contributions
of $1.2 billion from PPL to PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) to fund debt maturities, to repay short-term debt and to
terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Montana Colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests.

(PPL Electric)

In 2015, PPL Electric required $28 million less cash from financing
activities due to the use of cash on hand which helped support the significant capital expenditure program.

In 2014, PPL Electric required $75 million less cash from financing
activities to support its significant capital expenditure program, primarily due to the receipt of $150 million on notes receivable
from affiliates (as described in "Investing Activities" above) and improvements in cash from operations of $90 million.

(LKE)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities
decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt, partially offset by the $550 million of additional long-term debt issued
by LG&E and KU in 2015 and lower distributions to PPL.

In comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities
decreased as a result of the $500 million long-term debt issued by LG&E and KU in November 2013 and higher distributions to
PPL, partially offset by an increase in short-term debt and an increase in notes payable with affiliates to fund capital expenditures.

(LG&E)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities
decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt and lower capital contributions from LKE, partially offset by the $300
million of additional long-term debt issued in 2015.

In comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities
increased due to an increase in short-term debt to fund capital expenditures and an increase in contributions from LKE, offset
by the $250 million of long-term debt issued in November 2013.



(KU)

In comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities
decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt and lower capital contributions from LKE, partially offset by the $250
million of additional long-term debt issued in 2015.

In comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities
decreased as a result of the $250 million long-term debt issued in November 2013, a decrease of contributions from LKE and higher
dividends to LKE.

the program at an average price of $33.41 per share, receiving net proceeds of $49 million.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information
about long-term debt and equity securities.

Auction
Rate Securities

(LKE, LG&E and KU)

At December 31, 2015, LG&E's and KU's tax-exempt revenue
bonds in the form of auction rate securities total $231 million ($135 million at LG&E and $96 million at KU). These bonds continue
to experience failed auctions and the interest rate continues to be set by a formula pursuant to the relevant indentures. 
For the period ended December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rate on LG&E's and KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.22%
(0.20% at LG&E and 0.24% at KU).

Forecasted Sources of Cash

(All Registrants)

The Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity
available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally,
subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E
and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2016.

Credit Facilities

The Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity,
provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are
reflected in "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2015, the total committed borrowing capacity
under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

(a)

The syndicated credit facilities, as well as KU's letter of credit facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt
to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, as calculated in accordance
with the facility, and other customary covenants.

(b)

The commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates
providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: PPL - 13%, PPL Electric
- 12%, LKE - 21%, LG&E - 12% and KU - 37%.

(c)

Each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does KU under its letter of credit facility,
and borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin.

(d)

The facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings
before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its RAV, calculated in accordance
with the credit facility.

(e)

At December 31, 2015, the unused capacity under the U.K. committed credit facilities was approximately $1.4 billion. The commitments
under the U.K.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 14% of the total committed
capacity.

In addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above,
the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants
after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. The
Registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. At December 31, 2015, the Registrants were in compliance
with these covenants. At this time, the Registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit
access to these funding sources.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion

Long-term Debt and Equity Securities

(PPL)

PPL and its subsidiaries are currently authorized to incur,
subject to market conditions, up to approximately $2 billion of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be
used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.

PPL plans to issue not more than $200 million of common stock in 2016.

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric is currently authorized to incur, subject to market
conditions, up to approximately $500 million of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital

program to replace aging transmission and distribution assets. This table also includes LKE's environmental projects related to
existing and proposed EPA compliance standards excluding the Clean Power Plan (actual costs may be significantly lower or higher
depending on the final requirements and market conditions; most environmental compliance costs incurred by LG&E and KU in serving
KPSC jurisdictional customers are generally eligible for recovery through the ECR mechanism). See Note 6 to the Financial Statements
for information on LG&E's and KU's ECR mechanism and CPCN filing, and Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on
significant development plans.

In addition to cash on hand and cash from operations, the Registrants

(a)

Reflects principal maturities based on stated maturity or earlier put dates. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of LG&E and KU. The Registrants do not have any significant capital lease
obligations.

(b)

Assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. For PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU the payments herein are
subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for PPL, payments denominated
in British pounds sterling have been translated to U.S. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate.

(c)

See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(d)

The amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant
terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate
timing of the transaction. Primarily includes as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, nuclear fuel and limestone
as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

(e)

The amounts for PPL include WPD's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed
in March 2013. The U.K. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating
to the plan deficit. The amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2016 for PPL's and LKE's U.S. pension
plans (for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU includes their share of these amounts). Based on the current funded status of these plans,
except for WPD's plans, no cash contributions are required. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected
contributions.

(f)

At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized tax benefits of $5 million for PPL were excluded from this table as management
cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments.

(g)

Represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.



(h)

Represents future minimum payments under OVEC power purchase agreements through June 2040. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.

(i)

Represents construction commitments, including commitments for the LG&E's Mill Creek and KU's Ghent and E.W. Brown environmental
air projects, LG&E's and KU's E.W. Brown Solar Unit, KU's E.W. Brown landfill and LG&E's Ohio Falls refurbishment which
are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

Dividends/Distributions

(PPL)

PPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return
and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that
supports investment grade credit ratings. In November 2015, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 4,
2016, at 37.75 cents per share (equivalent to $1.51 per annum). On February 4, 2016, PPL announced that the company is increasing
its common stock dividend to 38 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to $1.52 per annum). Future dividends will be
declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements
and other relevant factors at the time. Subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution
on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated
Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2015, no interest payments were deferred.

See Note 8 for information regarding the June 1, 2015 distribution
to PPL's shareowners of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply
and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

From time to time, as determined by their respective Board of
Directors or Board of Managers, the Registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders
or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could
effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.

(All Registrants)

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions
related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.

Purchase or Redemption of Debt
Securities

The Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt
securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in
exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be
commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.

Rating Agency Actions

Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings
of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make
certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency
of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants
and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P
and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may
be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other
rating that may be assigned to the securities.

The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries
affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants'
or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants
and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration
of maturity dates of outstanding debt.

The following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries'
credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2015.

Ratings Triggers

(PPL)

As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, certain
of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned
to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1
or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change
to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate
and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled ยฃ4.4 billion (approximately $6.6 billion) nominal value
at December 31, 2015.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts
for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments
(for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract,
if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade.

See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including
a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability
position at December 31, 2015.

Guarantees
for Subsidiaries

(PPL)

PPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements.
Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates'
access to funds under these financing



arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit
the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not
limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

(All Registrants)

The Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may
contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
these agreements.

Risk Management

Market Risk

(All Registrants)

See Notes 1, 16, and 17 to the Financial Statements for information
about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.

The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates
of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ
materially from those presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of
possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.

Interest Rate Risk

The Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance
their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative
instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt
portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk
management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the
debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates.

a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

(c)

Changes in the fair value of such cash flow hedges are recorded in equity or as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities,
if recoverable through regulated rates, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects
earnings.



(d)

Cross-currency swaps are utilized to hedge the principal and interest payments of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
which the item being hedged affects earnings.

(e)

Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes
in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest
expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates
on interest expense at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was insignificant for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. The estimated
impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt at December 31 is shown below.

in U.K. affiliates.  Under its risk management program, PPL may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign
currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated
transactions and net investments.

Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading)

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E's and KU's retail electric rates, LG&E's natural
gas rates and KU's municipal wholesale electric rates are set by regulatory commissions and the fuel costs incurred are directly
recoverable from customers. As a result, LG&E and KU are subject to commodity price risk for only a small portion of their
business operations. LG&E and KU sell excess economic generation to maximize the value of the physical assets at times when
the assets are not required to serve LG&E's or KU's customers. See Note 17

to the Financial
Statements

for additional information.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric is exposed to market price and volumetric risks
from its obligation as a PLR. The PUC has approved a cost recovery mechanism that allows PPL Electric to pass through to customers
the cost associated with fulfilling its PLR obligation. This cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates PPL Electric's exposure
to market price risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement energy supply
contracts for the majority of its PLR obligations. These supply contracts transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR
obligation to the energy suppliers.



(All Registrants)

Defined Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk

See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined
Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss
as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and
procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and
require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit
risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial
institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit
risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan
for the period of June 2013 through May 2015. To date, PPL Electric has conducted all of its planned competitive solicitations.
In 2014, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC for approval of PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period of June 2015
through May 2017, which was approved in January 2015.

Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for
the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an
established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement
power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31,
2015, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were
not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of
collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to
its suppliers.

See Notes 14, 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements for additional
information on the competitive solicitation process, the Agreement, credit concentration and credit risk.

Foreign
Currency Translation

(PPL)

The value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation
to the U.S. dollar. In 2015, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $240 million, which
primarily reflected a $589 million decrease to PP&E and goodwill offset by a decrease of $349 million to net liabilities. In
2014, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $290 million, which primarily reflected
a $680 million decrease to PP&E and goodwill offset by a decrease of $390 million to net liabilities. In 2013, changes in this
exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $150 million, which primarily reflected a $330 million increase
to PP&E and goodwill offset by an increase of $180 million to net liabilities. The impact of foreign currency translation is
recorded in AOCI.

(All Registrants)

Related Party
Transactions

The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests
or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest
entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information
on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.

Acquisitions, Development
and Divestitures

The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for
potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and
other factors to determine whether to proceed with,



modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions
may impact future financial results. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the more significant activities.

(PPL)

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the
spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.

Environmental Matters

(All Registrants)

Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
are applicable to PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste,
as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with
certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental
laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating
and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also
applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact
the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating and maintenance expenses
are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future
environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.

See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of
the more significant environmental matters including:

ยท

Legal Matters,

ยท

Climate Change,

ยท

Coal Combustion Residuals,

ยท

Effluent Limitations Guidelines,

ยท

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards,

ยท

National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and

ยท

Superfund and Other Remediation.

Additionally, see "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters"
for additional information on environmental matters.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs)

In October 2015, the EPA's final rule regulating CCRs became
effective. In connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded increases to existing AROs of $228 million during 2015

.

See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Further increases to AROs or changes to current capital
plans or to operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results
and regulatory or legal proceedings. See Note 6 for details surrounding the CPCN and ECR filings that request rate recovery of
the costs related to this rule.

(All Registrants)

Competition

See "Competition" under each of PPL's reportable segments
in "Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of competitive
factors affecting the Registrants.

New
Accounting Guidance

See Notes 1 and 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion
of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption.

Application
of Critical Accounting Policies

Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by
the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies
are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations, and require management
to make estimates or other judgments of



matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates
or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented
in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management
has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application
and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.

Price
Risk Management

(PPL)

See "Price Risk Management" in Note 1 to the Financial
Statements, as well as "Financial Condition - Risk Management" above.

Defined Benefits

(All Registrants)

Certain of the Registrants' subsidiaries sponsor or participate
in, as applicable, various qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded
other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are applicable to the majority of the Registrants' employees (based on eligibility
for their applicable plans). The Registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded
status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory
assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. Consequently, the funded
status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Notes 6 and 11 to the Financial Statements
for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

A summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant
or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.

Management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation
of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current
earnings or regulatory assets based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in
AOCI, or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities, for amounts that are expected to be recovered
through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future
periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit
under the plans. The primary assumptions are:

ยท

Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit
payments to be made in the future.

The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount
that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash
flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

ยท

Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over
the life of the plan. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Registrants record currently.

ยท

Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension
benefits at retirement.

ยท

Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

In addition to the economic assumptions above that are evaluated
annually, Management must also make assumptions regarding the life expectancy of employees covered under their defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit



plans. At December 31, 2014, the plan sponsors adopted the new
mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 (RP-2014 base tables) for all U.S. defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements
and selected the IRS BB-2D two-dimensional improvement scale on a generational basis for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. These new mortality assumptions reflect the recognition of both improved life expectancies and the
expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies. The use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in an
increase to U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, an increase to future expense and a decrease
to funded status.

(PPL)

In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD
starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched
against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds
sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated
to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Historically, WPD used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot
rates used to discount the benefit obligation. Concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at December
31, 2015, WPD will begin using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of
2016 net periodic defined benefit cost.

An individual bond matching approach, which is used for the
U.S. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the U.K. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the U.K. is not
deep enough to adequately support such an approach.

(All Registrants)

In selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans,
the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash
flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins
with the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which
those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Individual bonds are then selected
based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue
that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.

To determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors
project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for
each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return
assumption.

In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors
consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.

The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions
used for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at December 31.

In selecting health care cost trend rates, plan sponsors consider
past performance and forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2015, the health care cost trend rate for all plans was 6.8%
for 2016, gradually declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% in 2020.

A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant
impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory
assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2015, the defined benefit plans were recorded in the Registrants' financial statements
as follows.

As a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became effective July 1, 2015, the
difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated
using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2015,
the balances were $10 million for PPL and LKE, $6 million for LG&E and $4 million for KU. See Note 6 for additional information.

The following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions
based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The tables reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption.
The inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined
benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities by a similar amount in the opposite direction. The sensitivities below

Goodwill
Impairment

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
PPL has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU each operate within
a single reportable segment and single reporting unit. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair
value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed
of.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make
a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill
for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected
and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.

When the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or
required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU determine whether a potential impairment
exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement
date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds
the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation
of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.
That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit
as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the
price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned
to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is
then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss
is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's
goodwill.

PPL elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment
test of goodwill for all its reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015. Management used both discounted cash flows and market
multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant assumptions used
in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, outcomes of future rate filings, projected operating and capital
cash flows and the fair value of debt. Projected operating and capital cash flows is based on PPL's internal business plan, which
assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector
market performance and comparable transactions.

Goodwill was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015, which consists
of $2.9 billion related to the acquisition of WPD and $662 million related to the acquisition of LKE. Applying an appropriate weighting
to both the discounted cash flow and market



multiple valuations for the most recent impairment tests performed
as of October 1, 2015, did not require the second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment.

A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates
related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or
a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units.

Loss
Accruals

(All Registrants)

Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions,
situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes. For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued
if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain
future outcomes, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines "probable" as
cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur." The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains
is not recorded unless recovery is assured. Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory
penalties and other events are continuously assessed.

The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1)
the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual,
and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects require significant
judgment by management. Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are consulted, as necessary, to
help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.

Certain other events have
been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual. Such events are disclosed, but
not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred. Accounting guidance defines "reasonably
possible" as cases in which "the future event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely to occur."

When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for
subsequently adjusting the loss accrual are identified, where applicable. The triggering events generally occur when new information
becomes known, the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is settled or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished
or been eliminated. The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the adjustment of certain recorded loss accruals:

ยท

Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have
been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected.

ยท

Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made,
a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable.

ยท

Actions or decisions by certain regulators could result in a better estimate of a previously recorded loss accrual.

Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that
the recorded probable loss exposures are appropriate. This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external
legal counsel, engineers, business unit management and other parties.

See Notes 6 and 13 to the Financial Statements for disclosure
of loss contingencies accrued and other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

ARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An ARO must
be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase
in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. For LG&E and KU, costs of
removal are collected in rates, and therefore the accretion and depreciation expenses related to an ARO are recorded as a regulatory
asset, such that there is no earnings impact.

See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information
on AROs.



In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments
and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of
market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement
date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations
of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.
Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized
asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.

At December 31, 2015, the total recorded balances and information
on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.

LKE




Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains

LG&E

KU




Ash ponds and landfills

The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted
retirement costs (including the settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), the discount rates and the inflation rates. At
December 31, 2015, a 10% change to retirement cost would increase the ARO liabilities by $44 million. A 0.25% decrease in
the discount rate would increase the ARO liabilities by $6 million and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase the
ARO liabilities by $6 million. For PPL, there would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset
or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. As noted above, these factors
do not impact the Statements of Income of LKE, LG&E and KU.

Income
Taxes

(All Registrants)

Significant management judgment is required in developing the
provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns,
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.

Significant management judgment is required to determine the
amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. The
first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more
likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant
taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second
step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization,
upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including
negotiation of a settlement.

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed
by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may
subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized,
or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues
raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements
in the future. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax
position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.

At December 31, 2015, no significant changes in unrecognized
tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.

The need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets
also require significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period
by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing
the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent
and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement
criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and
the effect of



this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes
into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ
materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements
in the future.

See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures,
including management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this
conclusion, PPL Global does not record U.S. income taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

(PPL)

WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under
distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. As the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not
subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate
regulation. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based
on revenue recognition and contingency guidance. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(All Registrants)

PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are subject to cost-based rate
regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and
liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated
entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future
recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future
regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the
regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is
accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.

Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets
are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments,
the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending
or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are
probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and
is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off.
Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.

At December 31, 2015, regulatory assets and regulatory
liabilities were recorded as reflected in the table below. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific
rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established
regulatory practices.

Revenue
Recognition - Unbilled Revenue

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service
is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of
the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period.
For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading
of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for
each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual
weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. For PPL
Electric, unbilled revenue amounts reflect actual deliveries since the date of the last billed meter reading multiplied by the
estimated average cents per kWh. At December 31, unbilled revenues recorded on the Balance Sheets were as follows.

are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes

Report of Independent Registered Public

of PPL Corporation

We have audited PPL Corporation and subsidiaries'
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
PPL Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting at Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, PPL Corporation and subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of PPL Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 19,

2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(All Registrants)

General

Capitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the combined
notes to financial statements are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted.
The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above or within
the applicable disclosure. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant.

Business
and Consolidation

(PPL)

PPL is a utility holding company that, through its regulated
subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in: 1) the distribution of electricity in the U.K.; 2) the generation, transmission, distribution
and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; and 3) the transmission, distribution
and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania. Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are PPL Global, LKE (including
its principal subsidiaries, LG&E and KU) and PPL Electric. PPL's corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding.

WPD, a subsidiary of PPL Global, through indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries operates distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. WPD serves end-users in South Wales and southwest
and central England. Its principal subsidiaries are WPD (South Wales), WPD (South West), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands).

PPL consolidates WPD on a one-month lag. Material events, such
as debt issuances that occur in the lag period, are recognized in the current period financial statements. Events that are significant
but not material are disclosed.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric
is a cost-based rate-regulated utility subsidiary of PPL. PPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and distribution
of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply
of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LKE
is a utility holding company with cost-based rate-regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LG&E and KU. LG&E
and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&E also engages in the distribution
and sale of natural gas. LG&E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective
names. KU also serves customers in Virginia (under the Old Dominion Power name) and in Tennessee under the KU name.

(PPL)

"Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income
taxes)" on the Statements of Income includes the activities of PPL Energy Supply, substantially representing PPL's former
Supply segment, which was spun off and distributed to PPL shareowners on June 1, 2015. PPL Energy Supply's assets and liabilities
have been reclassified on PPL's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 to "Current assets of discontinued operations", "Noncurrent
assets of discontinued operations", "Current liabilities of discontinued operations" and "Noncurrent liabilities
of discontinued operations". These assets and liabilities were distributed and removed from PPL's Balance Sheet in the second
quarter of 2015. In addition, the Statements of Cash Flows separately report the cash flows of the discontinued operations. See
Note 8 for additional information.

(All Registrants)

The financial statements of the Registrants include each company's
own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which
a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable
Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants



consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling
interest in the VIE, and thus are the primary beneficiary of the entity. The Registrants are not the primary beneficiary in any
VIEs. Investments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling
financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

The financial statements of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU include
their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those
facilities. See Note 12 for additional information.

Regulation

(PPL)

WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under
distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. Electricity distribution revenues are set by Ofgem for a given time period through price
control reviews that are not directly based on cost recovery. The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue is designed
to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs. As a result, WPD is not subject to accounting
for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities.

(All Registrants)

PPL
Electric, LG&E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric,
LG&E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to
shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period.  As a result, the financial statements are
subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions.
Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable
in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently
be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer
rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates
have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any
amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and
regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the
FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 6 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.

Accounting
Records

(All Registrants)

The system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained
in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.

(All
Registrants)

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Loss
Accruals

Potential losses are accrued when (1) information is available
that indicates it is "probable" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and
(2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the
future event or events are likely to occur." The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental
remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted
when appropriate.

The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not
recorded, unless realization is assured.



Changes
in Classification

The classification of certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 financial
statements have been changed to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications did not affect the Registrants' net
income or equity.

Earnings
Per Share

(PPL)

EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings
allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have
been available to common shareowners. Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or
dividend equivalents are considered participating securities.

Price
Risk Management

(All Registrants)

Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to change
in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposures to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate
debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency
exposures, primarily associated with PPL's investments in U.K. subsidiaries. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting
treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation.

Certain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative
because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets
are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved that would facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative
contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected. These contracts
are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance
sheets at fair value. The portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in "Current Assets"
and "Current Liabilities," while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in "Other
Noncurrent Assets" and "Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities."  See Note 17 to the Financial Statements
for additional information.

(PPL)

Processes exist that allow for subsequent review and validation
of the contract information as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. See Note 17 for more information.
The accounting department provides the treasury department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various
contract types and strategies. Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not
limited to:

ยท

Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the
forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring.

ยท

Cross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges.

ยท

Transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges.

ยท

Transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment
hedges.

ยท

Derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge treatment are marked to fair value through
earnings. These transactions generally include foreign currency forwards and options to hedge GBP earnings translation risk associated
with PPL's U.K. subsidiaries that report their financial statements in GBP. As such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility
due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

ยท

Derivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, LG&E and KU
if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are
included in customer rates.



(All Registrants)

Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments
are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification
of the hedged items.

PPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative
positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under
master netting arrangements.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

To meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric
has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.

See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on derivatives.

distribution revenues from the operation of WPD's distribution networks.

Revenue
Recognition

(All Registrants)

Operating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries
through the end of the calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered
throughout the month, rather than all meters being read and bills rendered at the end of the month. For LKE, LG&E and KU, unbilled
revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per kWh. For PPL
Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per
kWh. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month.

(PPL)

WPD is currently operating under RIIO - ED1, which commenced
on April 1, 2015. Ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes the amount of base demand revenue WPD can earn during
the price control period, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives
or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets. WPD's allowed revenue primarily includes base
demand revenue, incentive adjustments, adjustments for over or under-recovery and adjustments related to the DPCR4 line loss close
out.

As the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost
recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore,
the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition
and contingency guidance.

Unlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under
RIIO - ED1 will be adjusted during the price control period. The most significant of those adjustments are:

ยท

Inflation True-Up - The base demand revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set in 2012/13 prices. Therefore an inflation factor
as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base demand revenue.



Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals and affects
future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the "TRU" adjustment. The projected
TRU for the 2015/16 regulatory year is a $45 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years
2017 and 2018 by $30 million and $15 million, respectively.

ยท

Annual Iteration Process - The RIIO-ED1 price control period also includes an Annual Iteration Process (AIP). This will allow
future base demand revenues agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review to be updated during the price control
period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions and cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price
control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM).
Under the TIM, WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends.
The AIP calculates an incremental change to base demand revenue, known as the "MOD" adjustment. The MOD provided by Ofgem
in November 2016 will include the TIM for the 2015/16 regulatory year as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year
trailing average to October 2016. This projected MOD of $11 million will reduce base demand revenue for calendar years 2017 and
2018 by $5 million and $6 million, respectively.

As both MOD and TRU are changes to future base demand revenues
as determined by Ofgem, under applicable GAAP, liabilities for these adjustments have not been recorded.

In addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are
added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. The most significant of these are:

ยท

Incentives - Ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by
improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. Based on applicable GAAP, incentive revenues are not recorded as
assets and are included in revenues when they are billed to customers.

ยท

DPCR4 Line Loss Adjustment - For regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19 allowed revenue will
also be reduced to reflect Ofgem's final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. WPD has a liability
recorded related to this future revenue reduction and, therefore, this will not impact future earnings. See Note 6 to the Financial
Statements for additional information.

ยท

Correction Factor - During the price control period, WPD's revenue is decoupled from volume and WPD sets its tariffs to recover
allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered
do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. Conversely, WPD could also over-recover revenue. Over and under-recoveries
are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "Correction Factor" or "K-factor."
Over and under-recovered amounts arising from 2014/15 onwards and refunded/recovered under RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered
on a two year lag (previously one year). Therefore the 2014/15 over/under-recovery adjustment will occur in 2016/17. In 2016/17
under this mechanism, WPD will recover the ยฃ5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in
2014/15 (approximately $56 million) as that amount is currently considered an under-recovery.

Under applicable GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for
under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries. K-factor is measured as of the end of the regulatory year, March
31. While WPD estimates over-recoveries and records a liability when it is probable that there will be an over-recovered position
at the end of the regulatory-year, weather-related volume changes and other factors such as sales mix can affect the over or under-recovery
between the end of PPL's calendar year and the end of the regulatory year. .

Accounts
Receivable

(All Registrants)

Accounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the
gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded
at fair value on the date of acquisition.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In accordance
with a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative
electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers
have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. The



purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair
value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. During
2015, 2014 and 2013, PPL Electric purchased $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $985 million of accounts receivable from unaffiliated
third parties. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, PPL Electric purchased $146 million, $336 million and $294 million of accounts receivable
from PPL EnergyPlus. PPL Electric's purchases from PPL EnergyPlus for 2015 include purchases through May 31, 2015, which is the
period during which PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus were affiliated entities. As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy
Supply and creation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric.
PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are included as purchases from an unaffiliated
third party.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

(All Registrants)

Accounts receivable collectability is evaluated using a combination
of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable, counterparty
creditworthiness and economic conditions. Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered. Adjustments to the allowance
for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry
trends.

Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the
receivable is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when it is known they
will be received.

The changes
in the allowance for doubtful accounts were:

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Bank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted
by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents.
The change in restricted cash and cash equivalents is reported as an investing activity on the Statements of Cash Flows. On the
Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is included in "Other current assets", while
the noncurrent portion is included in "Other noncurrent assets."

Fair
Value Measurements

(All Registrants)

The Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets
and liabilities at fair value. Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and
liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as
appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques
and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability.
These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management
believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate,
as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.

The Registrants classify fair value measurements within one
of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

ยท

Level 1

- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the
measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

ยท

Level 2

- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable
for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

ยท

Level 3

-

unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants
would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value.

Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment
that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular
input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy.

Investments

(All Registrants)

Generally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's
intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term
or long-term. Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other
than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for
the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments generally include certain deposits as
well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. Investments with original
maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year
that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in "Short-term investments" ("Other
current assets" if not significant) on the Balance Sheets.



Cost
Method Investment

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E and KU each have an investment in OVEC, which is accounted
for using the cost method. The investment is recorded in "Other noncurrent assets" on the PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU Balance
Sheets. LG&E and KU and ten other electric utilities are equity owners of OVEC. OVEC's power is currently supplied to LG&E
and KU and 11 other companies affiliated with the various owners. LG&E and KU own 5.63% and 2.5% of OVEC's common stock. Pursuant
to a power purchase agreement, LG&E and KU are contractually entitled to their ownership percentage of OVEC's output, which
is approximately 120 MW for LG&E and approximately 53 MW for KU.

LG&E's and KU's combined investment in OVEC is not significant.
The direct exposure to loss as a result of LG&E's and KU's involvement with OVEC is generally limited to the value of their
investments; however, LG&E and KU are conditionally responsible for a pro-rata share of certain OVEC obligations. As part of
PPL's acquisition of LKE, the value of the power purchase contract was recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting regulatory
liability, both of which are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the
agreement. See Notes 13 and 18 for additional discussion of the power purchase agreement.

Long-Lived
and Intangible Assets

Property,
Plant and Equipment

(All Registrants)

PP&E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. PP&E
acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, which establishes its original cost. If
impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. Original cost for
constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable. The cost
of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. The Registrants record costs associated with planned major
maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are incurred. No costs associated with planned major maintenance projects
are accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed. LG&E and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage
value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance
with regulatory practices. Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability
until the removal costs are incurred. See "Asset Retirement Obligations" below and Note 6 for additional information.
PPL Electric records net costs of removal when incurred as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is subsequently amortized through
depreciation over a five-year period, which is recoverable in customer rates in accordance with regulatory practices.

AFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric as part of the construction
costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service.
The debt component of AFUDC is credited to "Interest Expense" and the equity component is credited to "Other Income
(Expense) - net" on the Statements of Income. LG&E and KU generally do not record AFUDC, except for certain instances
in KU's FERC approved rates charged to its municipal customers, as a return is provided on construction work in progress.

(PPL)

PPL capitalizes interest costs as part of construction costs.

Capitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC for PPL, was
as follows.

Depreciation

(All Registrants)

Depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of
property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component of PP&E that was
depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all
or a significant portion of an operating unit that



was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired
or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless
otherwise required by regulators.

The following

Effective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the
useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from
55 years for GAAP reporting of depreciation expense. For 2015, this change in useful lives resulted in lower depreciation expense
of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).

(All
Registrants)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination.

Other acquired intangible assets are initially measured based
on their fair value. Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in
which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. Costs incurred to obtain an initial license
and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets.

When determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including
intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider the expected use of the asset; the expected useful
life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions
that may limit the useful life; the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension;
the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required
to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU account for emission allowances as
intangible assets. LG&E and KU are allocated emission allowances by states based on their generation facilities' historical
emissions experience, and have purchased emission allowances generally when it is expected that additional allowances will be needed.
The carrying value of allocated emission allowances is initially recorded at zero value and purchased allowances are initially
recorded based on their purchase price. When consumed or sold, emission allowances are removed from the Balance Sheet at their
weighted-average carrying value. Since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not diminished until they are consumed,
emission allowances are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold. Such
expense is included in "Fuel" on the Statements of Income. Gains and losses on the sale of emission allowances are included
in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income.

Asset
Impairment (Excluding Investments)

The Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to
depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.

A long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value.



A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when
the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal
group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU review goodwill for impairment at
the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting
unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion
of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed. PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's reporting units are at the operating
segment level.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make
a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill
for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected
and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test
is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying
amount based on the step zero assessment.

If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill,
exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated in the same manner as goodwill in a business combination.
The fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities
is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, goodwill is written
down to its implied fair value.

PPL (for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments),
and individually, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to bypass step zero and quantitatively tested the goodwill of these reporting units
for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairment was recognized.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

(

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU

)

PPL
and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.
Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of
accretion expense classified within "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income

to
reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. The accretion and depreciation expenses recorded by LG&E and
KU are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact.

Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying
value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated
into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the
remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See Note 19 for additional information on AROs.

Compensation
and Benefits

Defined
Benefits

(All Registrants)

Certain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with
an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded
status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.

The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a
market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions,
disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected
value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.

PPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition
of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of
30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the expected average remaining
service of active plan participants. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit
obligation or the market-related



value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan's projected
benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active plan participants.

See Note 6 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined
benefit costs and Note 11 for a discussion of defined benefits.

Stock-Based
Compensation

(PPL, PPL Electric and
LKE)

PPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes
of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock
units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stock-based awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL and its
subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method. Stock options that vest in installments
are valued as a single award. PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less than the fair value of PPL's common
stock on the date of grant. See Note 10 for a discussion of stock-based compensation. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability
on the Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation is primarily included in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements
of Income. Stock-based compensation expense for PPL Electric and LKE includes an allocation of PPL Services' expense.

Taxes

Income Taxes

(All Registrants)

PPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal
income tax return.

Significant management judgment is required in developing the
Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken
in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely
reinvested.

Significant management judgment is also required to determine
the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position. The Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate
tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax
position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes
that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.
The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization,
upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ
materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income
tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

The Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The Registrants consider the reversal of temporary differences,
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and subsequently reevaluating
the need for valuation allowances. If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future
in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense
in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or
part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax
expense in the period that such determination is made.

The Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits
are utilized and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets.

The Registrants recognize interest and penalties in
"Income Taxes" on their Statements of Income.



See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes
including management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this
conclusion, PPL Global does not record U.S. taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings.

The provision for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU's
deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the regulators.
The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded
under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheet in noncurrent "Regulatory assets" or "Regulatory liabilities."

(PPL
Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

The income tax provision for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and
KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement which provides that taxable income be calculated as if
PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. Tax benefits are not shared between
companies. The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. The effect of PPL filing
a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.

At
December 31, the following intercompany tax receivables (payables) were recorded.

(All Registrants)

The Registrants present sales taxes in "Other current liabilities"
and PPL presents value-added taxes in "Taxes" on the Balance Sheets. These taxes are not reflected on the Statements
of Income. See Note 5 for details on taxes included in "Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income.

Other

(All
Registrants)

Leases

The Registrants evaluate whether arrangements entered into contain
leases for accounting purposes. See Note 9 for additional information.

Fuel,
Materials and Supplies

Fuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies
are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Fuel costs for electric generation are charged
to expense as used. For LG&E, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense as delivered to the distribution system. See
Note 6 for further discussion of the fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause.

Guarantees

(All Registrants)

Generally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability
is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting
guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance
that only require disclosure. See Note 13 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees.

Treasury
Stock

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL and PPL Electric restore all shares of common stock acquired
to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon acquisition.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions

(PPL)

WPD's functional currency is the GBP, which is the local currency
in the U.K. As such, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and
related revenues and expenses are generally translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period included in PPL's
results of operations. Adjustments resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in AOCI.

Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are
recognized in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statements of Income. See Note 15 for additional information.

New
Accounting Guidance Adopted

(All Registrants)

Reporting of Discontinued Operations

Effective January 1, 2015, the Registrants prospectively adopted
accounting guidance that changes the criteria for determining what should be classified as a discontinued operation and the related
presentation and disclosure requirements. A discontinued operation may include a component of an entity or a group of components
of an entity, or a business activity. A disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required
to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on
the entity's operations and financial results when any of the following occurs: (1) The components of an entity or group of components
of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, (2) The component of an entity or group of components of an
entity is disposed of by sale, or (3) The component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of other than
by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff).

As a result of the spinoff on June 1, 2015, PPL Energy Supply
has been reported as a discontinued operation under the new discontinued operations guidance. See Note 8 for additional information.

Fair Value Measurement for Investments in Certain Entities
that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share

Effective December 31, 2015, the Registrants retrospectively
adopted accounting guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which
fair value is measured using net asset value per share and the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that
are eligible to be measured using net asset value per share.

The adoption of this guidance resulted in the Registrants no
longer categorizing investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share in the fair value hierarchy, and
did not have a significant impact on the Registrants. See Note 11 for additional information.

Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

Effective December 31, 2015, the Registrants retrospectively
adopted accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires certain debt issuance costs
to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability.

The adoption of this guidance required the Registrants to reclassify
debt issuance costs not associated with a line of credit from noncurrent assets to Long-term debt, and did not have a significant
impact on the Registrants. See Note 7 for additional information.



Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

Effective October 1, 2015, the Registrants retrospectively adopted
accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

The adoption of this guidance required the Registrants to reclassify
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities from current to noncurrent on the balance sheet, and did not have a significant
impact on the Registrants. The following table presents the amounts reclassified from current deferred tax assets and liabilities
to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2014.

2.
Segment and Related Information

(PPL)

PPL is organized into three segments: U.K. Regulated, Kentucky
Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated. PPL's segments are segmented by geographic location.

The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global which primarily
includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British
pound sterling into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and allocated financing costs.

The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated
electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution
and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment

.

The Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of PPL Electric,
a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.

"Corporate and Other" primarily includes financing
costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated
costs, which is presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results.

On June 1, 2015, PPL completed the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply,
which substantially represented PPL's Supply segment. As a result of this transaction, PPL no longer has a Supply segment. See
Note 8 for additional information.

4.
Earnings Per Share

(PPL)

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common
shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by
dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by incremental
shares that



would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating
securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the Treasury Stock Method or If-Converted Method, as applicable.
Incremental non-participating securities that have a dilutive impact are detailed in the table below.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting
purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The provision
for PPL's deferred income taxes for regulated assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles of the applicable
jurisdiction. See Notes 1 and 6 for additional information.

Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's

reflected on the PPL Energy Supply Segment. The deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance remain with PPL after the spinoff.

State deferred taxes are determined on a by entity, by
jurisdiction basis. As a result, $22 million of net deferred tax assets are shown as "Other noncurrent assets" on

The reductions of the U.K. statutory income tax rates in 2015 and
2013 resulted in $44 million and $67 million in reductions in deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowances. See
"Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense" below for more information on the impact of the U.K. Finance Acts 2015 and 2013.

(b)

on the PPL Energy Supply Segment. The deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance remain with PPL after the spinoff.

PPL Global
does not record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of WPD, with the exception of certain financing entities, as management
has determined that the earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Historically, dividends paid by WPD have been distributions from
current year's earnings. WPD's long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future
require reinvestment of WPD's undistributed earnings, and WPD would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any
distributions in excess of current earnings. Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections
for the foreseeable future do not require or contemplate distributions from WPD in excess of some portion of future WPD earnings.
The cumulative undistributed earnings are included in "Earnings Reinvested" on the Balance Sheets. The amounts considered
indefinitely reinvested at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $4.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. If the WPD undistributed
earnings were remitted as dividends, PPL Global could be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that could be payable on these foreign earnings in the event of
repatriation to the U.S.

During 2015, PPL recorded $24 million of deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation
allowances. PPL recorded state deferred income tax expense of $12 million primarily related to increased Pennsylvania net operating
loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized and $12 million of federal deferred income tax expense primarily related to federal
tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire as a result of lower future taxable earnings due to the extension of bonus
depreciation.

As a result of the PPL Energy Supply spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense during 2014
to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously
supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply. See Note 8 for additional information on the spinoff.

During 2013, PPL recorded $23 million of state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily
due to a decrease in projected future taxable income at PPL Energy Supply over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania
net operating losses.



(b)

The U.K. Finance Act 2015, enacted in November 2015, reduced the U.K.
statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result, PPL
reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2015 related to both rate decreases.

The U.K. Finance Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective April
1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective April 1, 2015. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a
deferred tax benefit during 2013 related to both rate decreases.

(c)

During 2015, PPL recorded lower income taxes primarily attributable
to a decrease in taxable dividends.

During 2014, PPL recorded $47 million of income tax expense primarily attributable to taxable dividends.

During 2013, PPL recorded $28 million of income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million
income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits
that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return.

(d)

In 2015, PPL
recorded a $12 million tax benefit related to the settlement of the IRS audit for the tax years 1998-2011.

In May 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the U.K. Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) imposed on privatized utilities, including WPD,
is a creditable tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, PPL recorded a tax benefit of
$44 million during 2013, of which $19 million relates to interest.

In 2013, PPL recorded a federal and state income tax reserve benefit of $7 million related to stranded cost securitization.
The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization was zero.

(e)

During each period, PPL recorded adjustments related to its December
31 state deferred tax liabilities as a result of annual changes in state apportionment and the impact on the future estimated state
income tax rate.

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits

(All Registrants)

PPL or
its subsidiaries file tax returns in four major tax jurisdictions. The income tax provisions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and
KU are calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement which provides that taxable income be calculated as
if each domestic subsidiary filed a separate consolidated return. Based on this tax sharing agreement, PPL Electric or its subsidiaries
indirectly or directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions, and LKE, LG&E and KU or their subsidiaries indirectly
or directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions.

With few exceptions,
at December 31, 2015, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years that are no longer subject to examination, were as follows.

Operations After Income Taxes.

Utility Rate Regulation

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

(All Registrants)

PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU reflect the effects
of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and
liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or
refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.

WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain
types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 for additional information.

(PPL,
LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC,
and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC, VSCC and TRA.

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based
on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments
and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.

As a result of purchase accounting requirements, certain fair
value amounts related to contracts that had favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market were recorded on the Balance Sheets
with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. LG&E and KU recover in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases
and emission allowances. As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value
amounts at LKE's acquisition date meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate-making
impact of the fair value adjustments. LG&E's and KU's customer rates will continue to reflect the original contracted prices
for these contracts.

(PPL, LKE and KU)

KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on
rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). All regulatory assets and
liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia
base rates. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets.

KU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements
are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital
less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). All



regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return
on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets.

(PPL
and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based
on recovery of costs as well as a return on distribution rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related
deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions).  PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance
with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related rate base (net utility
plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions) and
an automatic annual update.  See "Transmission Formula Rate" below for additional information on this tariff. 
All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore,
generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets.

(a)

For PPL, these amounts are included in "Other current assets"
on the Balance Sheets.

(b)

These
liabilities were recorded as offsets to certain intangible assets that were recorded at fair value upon the acquisition of LKE
by PPL.

Following
is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables. Specific developments with respect
to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in "Regulatory Matters."

Defined Benefit Plans

(All Registrants)

Defined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent
the portion of unrecognized transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be recovered
in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and generally, are amortized
over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually
or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is re-measured. Of the regulatory asset and liability balances recorded,
costs of $46 million for PPL, $18 million for PPL Electric, $28 million for LKE, $19 million for LG&E and $9 million for KU
are expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2016 in accordance with PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's
and KU's pension accounting policy.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

As a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became
effective July 1, 2015, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E and KU's pension accounting
policy and pension cost calculated using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is recorded as a regulatory
asset. As of December 31, 2015, the balances were $10 million for PPL and LKE, $6 million for LG&E and $4 million for
KU. Of the costs expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2016, $10 million for PPL and LKE, $6 million
for LG&E and $4 million for KU are expected to be recorded as a regulatory asset in 2016.



(All Registrants)

Storm Costs

PPL Electric, LG&E and KU have the ability to request from
the PUC, KPSC and VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory
asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&E and KU can
request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover
qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense
Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. LG&E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs are being
amortized through various dates ending in 2020.

Unamortized Loss on Debt

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term
debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished
debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric,
2035 for LG&E and through 2040 for PPL, LKE and KU.

Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant

LG&E and KU accrue for costs of removal through depreciation
expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.

PPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs
of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized
over the subsequent five-year period.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Generation Supply Charge

The generation supply charge is a cost recovery mechanism that
permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply
service. The recovery includes charges for generation supply (energy and capacity and ancillary services), as well as administration
of the acquisition process. In addition, the generation supply charge contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or
under-recovery from prior quarters is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the
subsequent quarter.

Transmission Service Charge (TSC)

PPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related
costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service
through the PUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery
from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent
year.

Transmission Formula Rate

PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance
with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula,
rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions.
Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions. Any difference between the
revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset
or regulatory liability.

Storm Damage Expense

In accordance with the PUC's December 2012 final rate case order,
PPL Electric proposed the establishment of a Storm Damage Expense Rider (SDER) with the PUC. In April 2014, the PUC issued a final
order approving the SDER with a January 1, 2015 effective date. On June 20, 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA)
filed a petition requesting the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania to reverse and remand the April 2014 order, which petition remains
outstanding. On



January 15, 2015, the PUC issued an order modifying the
effective date of the SDER to February 1, 2015. See below under "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities" for
additional information on the SDER.

Taxes Recoverable through Future Rates

Taxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion
of future income taxes that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. Accordingly, this
regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized. For general-purpose financial reporting,
this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. This regulatory asset
is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are
incurred.

Act 129 Compliance Rider

In compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing
regulations, Phase I of PPL Electric's energy efficiency and conservation plan was approved by a PUC order in October 2009. The
order allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $250 million cost of the program ratably over the life of the plan, from January
1, 2010 through May 31, 2013. Phase II of PPL's energy efficiency and conservation plan allows PPL Electric to recover the
maximum $185 million cost of the program over the three year period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016. The plan includes programs
intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development
costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution
service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers
will be refunded or recovered at the end of the program. See below under "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities"
for additional information on Act 129.

(PPL,
LKE, LG&E and KU)

Environmental Cost Recovery

Kentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs, including
a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal,
state or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electric generating
facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing
periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base
rates each two-year period. As a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became effective July 1, 2015, LG&E
and KU were authorized to earn a 10% return on equity for all their existing ECR plans. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents
the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered within
12 months.

Gas Supply Clause

LG&E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby
the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs from prior periods are adjusted quarterly
in LG&E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC. The gas supply clause includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive
mechanism, which allows LG&E's rates to be adjusted annually to share variances between actual costs and market indices between
the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). The regulatory assets
or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms
and are typically recovered within 18 months.

Fuel Adjustment Clauses

LG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment
clause, whereby variances in the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded
in base rates are adjusted in LG&E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires public hearings at six-month intervals to examine past
fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate,
reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under-
or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.

KU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia
customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs. The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows
fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the coming year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses
from the prior year. The regulatory assets or



liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered
due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.

Demand Side Management

LG&E's and KU's DSM programs consist of energy efficiency
programs which are intended to reduce peak demand and delay the investment in additional power plant construction, provide customers
with tools and information to become better managers of their energy usage and prepare for potential future legislation governing
energy efficiency. LG&E's and KU's rates contain a DSM provision which includes a rate recovery mechanism that provides for
concurrent recovery of DSM costs and incentives, and allows for the recovery of DSM revenues from lost sales associated with the
DSM programs. Additionally, LG&E and KU earn an approved return on equity for capital expenditures associated with the residential
and commercial load management/demand conservation programs. The cost of DSM programs is assigned only to the class or classes
of customers that benefit from the programs.

Interest Rate Swaps

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Periodically, LG&E and KU enter into forward-starting interest
rate swaps with PPL that have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties. Net realized gains
and losses on all of these swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, any gains and losses on these derivatives
are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and will be recognized in "Interest Expense" on the Statements of Income
over the life of the underlying debt at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. In September 2015, first mortgage
bonds totaling $1.05 billion were issued (LG&E issued $550 million and KU issued $500 million) and all outstanding forward-starting
interest rate swaps were terminated. Net cash settlements of $88 million were paid on the swaps that were terminated (LG&E
and KU each paid $44 million). Net realized losses on these terminated swaps will be recovered through regulated rates. As such,
the net settlements were recorded in regulatory assets and are being recognized in "Interest Expense" on the Statements
of Income over the life of the new debt that matures in 2025 and 2045. There were no forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding
at December 31, 2015. See Note 17 for additional information related to the forward-starting interest rate swaps.

Net cash settlements of $86 million were received on forward
starting interest rate swaps that were terminated in 2013 (LG&E and KU each received $43 million). Net realized gains on these
terminated swaps will be returned through regulated rates. As such, the net settlements were recorded as regulatory liabilities
and are being recognized in "Interest Expense" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt that
matures in 2043.

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

In addition to the terminated forward starting interest rate
swaps, realized amounts associated with LG&E's other interest rate swaps, including a terminated swap contract from 2008, are
recoverable through rates based on an order from the KPSC, LG&E's unrealized losses and gains are recorded as a regulatory
asset or liability until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered
over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033. Amortization of the gain or loss related to the 2008 terminated
swap contract is to be recovered through 2035.

AROs

As discussed in Note 1, the accretion and depreciation expenses
related to LG&E's and KU's AROs are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact. When an asset with
an ARO is retired, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PP&E
and ARO liability.

Gas Line Tracker

The GLT authorizes LG&E to recover its incremental operating
expenses, depreciation, property taxes, and its cost of capital including a return on equity for capital associated with the five
year gas service riser, leak mitigation and customer service line ownership programs. As a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case
settlement that became effective July 1, 2015, LG&E is authorized to earn a 10% return on equity for the GLT mechanism. As
part of this program, LG&E makes necessary repairs and assumes ownership of natural gas lines. LG&E annually files projected
costs in October to become effective on the first billing cycle in January. After the completion of a plan year, LG&E submits
a balancing adjustment filing to the KPSC to amend rates charged for the differences between the actual costs and actual GLT charges
for the preceding year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due
to these timing differences.



Coal Contracts

As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition
of LKE, LG&E's and KU's coal contracts were recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheets with offsets to regulatory assets
for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to current market prices and offsets to regulatory liabilities for those contracts
with favorable terms relative to current market prices. These regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized over the same
terms as the related contracts, which expire at various times through 2016.

Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC

As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition
of LKE, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LKE, LG&E and KU with offsets
to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026,
the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition.

Regulatory Liability Associated with Net Deferred Tax Assets

LG&E's and KU's regulatory liabilities associated with net
deferred tax assets represent the future revenue impact from the reversal of deferred income taxes required primarily for unamortized
investment tax credits. These regulatory liabilities are recognized when the offsetting deferred tax assets are recognized.

Plant Retirement Costs

The 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became effective
July 1, 2015, provided for deferred recovery of costs associated with Green River's remaining coal-fired generating units through
their retirement date, which occurred in September 2015. These costs include inventory write-downs and separation benefits and
will be amortized over three years.

Ofgem Review of Line Loss Calculation

In 2014, Ofgem issued its final decision on the DPCR4 line loss
incentives and penalties mechanism. As a result, during 2014 WPD increased its liability by $65 million for over-recovery of line
losses with a reduction to "Operating Revenues" on the Statement of Income. In 2013, WPD had recorded an increase of
$45 million to the liability with a reduction to "Operating Revenues" on the Statement of Income. Other activity impacting
the liability included reductions in the liability that have been included in tariffs and foreign exchange movements. WPD began
refunding the liability to customers on April 1, 2015 and will continue through March 31, 2019. The liability at December 31,
2015 and 2014 was $61 million and $99 million.

Rate Case Proceedings

On June 30, 2015, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement
providing for increases in the annual revenue requirements associated with KU base electricity rates of $125 million and LG&E
base gas rates of $7 million. The annual revenue requirement associated with base electricity rates at LG&E was not changed.
Although the settlement did not establish a specific return on equity with respect to the base rates, an authorized 10% return
on equity will be utilized in the ECR and GLT mechanisms. The settlement agreement provides for deferred recovery of costs associated
with KU's retirement of Green River Units 3 and 4. The new regulatory asset will be amortized over three years. The settlement
also provides regulatory asset treatment for the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with LG&E and



KU's pension accounting policy and pension expense using a 15
year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses. The new rates and all elements of the settlement became effective July
1, 2015.

KPSC Landfill Proceedings

On May 22, 2015, LG&E and KU filed an application with the
KPSC for a declaratory order that the existing CPCN and ECR approvals regarding the initial phases of construction and rate recovery
of the landfill for management of CCRs at the Trimble County Station remain in effect. The current design of the proposed landfill
provides for construction in substantially the same location as originally proposed with approximately the same storage capacity
and expected useful life. On May 20, 2015, the owner of an underground limestone mine filed a complaint with the KPSC requesting
it to revoke the CPCN for the Trimble County landfill and limit recovery of costs for the Ghent Station landfill on the grounds
that, as a result of cost increases, the proposed landfill no longer constitutes the least cost alternative for CCR management.
The KPSC has initiated its own investigation, consolidated the proceedings, and ordered an accelerated procedural schedule. The
KPSC conducted a hearing on the matter in September 2015. On December 15, 2015, the KPSC issued an order affirming LG&E and
KU's existing CPCN and ECR authority for Phase 1 of the Trimble County and Ghent landfills and related facilities, and that the
landfills are the least cost options for disposing of the combustion wastes. Additionally, the order requires LG&E and KU to
file a CPCN prior to constructing Phases 2 and 3 at the Ghent landfill and Phases 2 through 4 at the Trimble County landfill. The
order also requires LG&E and KU to submit status update reports every three months on Phase 1 of Trimble County landfill. Phase
1 of construction at Trimble County will commence after the required state permits are obtained. Phase 1 of the Ghent landfill
was completed in December 2014.

CPCN and ECR Filings

On January 29, 2016, LG&E and KU submitted applications
to the KPSC for CPCNs and for ECR rate treatment regarding upcoming environmental construction projects relating to the EPA's regulations
addressing the handling of coal combustion byproducts and MATS. The construction projects are expected to begin in 2016 and continue
through 2023 and are estimated to cost approximately $316 million at LG&E and $678 million at KU. The applications request
an authorized 10% return on equity with respect to LG&E and KU's ECR mechanism consistent with the 2014 Kentucky rate case
approved in June 2015.

Pennsylvania
Activities

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking
mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use
of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore,
are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of
its delivery system, including the replacement of aging distribution assets

Rate Case Proceeding

On March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC
for an increase in its annual distribution revenue requirement of approximately $167.5 million. The application was based on a
fully projected future test year of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On September 3, 2015, PPL Electric filed with the
PUC Administrative Law Judge a petition for approval of a settlement agreement under which PPL Electric would be permitted to increase
its annual distribution rates by $124 million, effective January 1, 2016. On November 19, 2015, the PUC entered a final order adopting
the Administrative Law Judge's recommended decision. The new rates became effective January 1, 2016.

Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)

On March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting
a waiver of the DSIC cap of 5% of billed revenues and approval to increase the maximum allowable DSIC from 5% to 7.5% for service
rendered after January 1, 2016. PPL Electric filed the petition concurrently with its 2015 rate case and the Administrative Law
Judge granted PPL Electric's request to consolidate these two proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed
above, PPL Electric agreed to withdraw the petition without prejudice to re-file it at a later date.



In September 2012, PPL Electric filed its LTIIP describing projects
eligible for inclusion in the DSIC and, in an order entered on May 23, 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's proposed DSIC with
an initial rate effective July 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings. The PUC also assigned four technical recovery calculation
issues to the Office of Administrative Law Judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision. In November 2015, the PUC
issued an opinion and order approving PPL Electric's Petition with minor modifications.

Storm Damage Expense Rider (SDER)

In its December 2012 final rate case order, the PUC directed
PPL Electric to file a proposed SDER. The SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually
will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recoup any differences from customers. In March
2013, PPL Electric filed its proposed SDER with the PUC and, as part of that filing, requested recovery of the 2012 qualifying
storm costs related to Hurricane Sandy. PPL Electric proposed that the SDER become effective January 1, 2013 at a zero rate with
qualifying storm costs incurred in 2013 and the 2012 Hurricane Sandy costs be included in rates effective January 1, 2014. In April
2014, the PUC issued a final order approving the SDER with a January 1, 2015 effective date and initially including actual
storm costs compared to collections for December 2013 through November 2014. As a result, PPL Electric reduced its regulatory liability
by $12 million in March 2014. Also, as part of the April 2014 order, PPL Electric was authorized to recover Hurricane Sandy storm
damage costs through the SDER of $29 million over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2015.

In June 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA) filed a
petition with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania requesting that the Court reverse and remand the April 2014 order permitting
PPL Electric to establish the SDER. In December 2015, the Commonwealth Court issued an Opinion affirming the PUC's April 2014 Order.
On January 15, 2015, the PUC issued a final order closing an investigation related to a separate OCA complaint concerning
PPL Electric's October 2014 preliminary SDER calculation and modified the effective date of the SDER to February 1, 2015.

In the PUC rate case settlement agreement approved by the Commission
in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set
at $15 million. The SDER will recover from customers or refund to customers, as appropriate, only applicable expenses from reportable
storms that are greater than or less than $15 million recovered annually through base rates. Beginning January 1, 2018, the amortized
2011 storm expense of $5 million will be included in the base rate component of the SDER.

Act 129

Act 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies
(EDCs) to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates. EDCs not meeting
the requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties. In November 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC its Act
129 Phase III Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan for the period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. In January 2016, PPL Electric
and the other parties reached a settlement in principle. The settlement is subject to PUC approval. This matter remains pending
before the PUC.

Act 129 also requires Default Service Providers (DSP) to provide
electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan through auctions,
requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole discretion of the DSP. Act 129 requires a mix of spot market purchases,
short-term contracts and long-term contracts (4 to 20 years), with long-term contracts limited to 25% of load unless otherwise
approved by the PUC. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan.

PPL Electric has received PUC approval of biannual DSP procurement
plans for all periods required under Act 129. In January 2016, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Approval of a new DSP procurement
plan with the PUC for the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2021. A Prehearing Conference is scheduled for March 2016. This proceeding
remains pending before the PUC. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Smart Meter Rider (SMR)

Act 129 also requires installation of smart meters for new construction,
upon the request of consumers and at their cost, or on a depreciation schedule not exceeding 15 years. Under Act 129, EDCs
are able to recover the costs of providing smart metering technology. All of PPL Electric's metered customers currently have advanced
meters installed at their service locations capable of many of the functions required under Act 129. PPL Electric conducted pilot
projects and technical evaluations of its current advanced metering technology and concluded that the current technology does not
meet all of the requirements of Act 129. PPL Electric recovered the cost of its pilot programs and evaluations through a cost recovery
mechanism, the Smart Meter Rider. In August 2013, PPL Electric filed with the PUC an annual report describing the actions



it was taking under its Smart Meter Plan during 2013 and its
planned actions for 2014. PPL Electric also submitted revised SMR charges that became effective January 1, 2014. In June 2014,
PPL Electric filed its final Smart Meter Plan with the PUC. In that plan, PPL Electric proposes by the end of 2019 to replace all
of its current meters with new meters that meet the Act 129 requirements. The total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately
$471 million, of which approximately $406 million is expected to be capital. PPL Electric proposes to recover these costs through
the SMR which the PUC previously approved for recovery of such costs. On April 30, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge assigned
by the PUC to review PPL Electric's Smart Meter Plan issued a recommended decision approving the plan with minor modifications.
On September 3, 2015, the PUC entered a final order approving the Smart Meter Plan with minor modifications.

Federal Matters

FERC
Formula Rates

(PPL and PPL Electric

)

Transmission rates are regulated by the FERC. PPL Electric's
transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) that utilizes a
formula-based rate recovery mechanism. The formula rate is calculated, in part, based on financial results as reported in PPL Electric's
annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts.

FERC
Wholesale Formula Rates

(LKE and KU)

In September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to
adjust the formula rate under which KU provided wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers. Among other changes,
the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs,
replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up. KU's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%.
Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund. In April 2014, nine municipalities
submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements
contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. In
addition, a tenth municipality has become a transmission-only customer as of June 2015. In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms
with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its
approval. In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective
pending a final order. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the FERC approved the settlement agreement resolving the rate case with
respect to these two municipalities, including approval of the formula rate with a true-up provision and authorizing a return on
equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower. In August 2015, KU filed a partial
settlement agreement with the nine terminating municipalities, resolving all but one open matter with one municipality. The settlement
was approved by FERC in the fourth quarter of 2015, including authorizing the agreed-upon refunds, approving the formula rate with
a true-up provision, and authorizing a 10.25% return on equity. Refunds to both the remaining municipals and the departing municipals
were issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $3.4 million. A single remaining unresolved issue with one terminating municipality
is in FERC litigation proceedings. Hearings on the dispute were conducted in January 2016 and preliminary rulings on the matter
may occur in mid- or late-2016. KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this FERC proceeding, but the amounts under continuing
dispute are not estimated to be significant.

Includes PPL Electric's senior secured and first mortgage bonds that
are secured by the lien of PPL Electric's 2001 Mortgage Indenture, which covers substantially all electric distribution plant and
certain transmission plant owned by PPL Electric. The carrying value of PPL Electric's property, plant and equipment was approximately
$6.7 billion and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Includes LG&E's first mortgage bonds that are
secured by the lien of the LG&E 2010 Mortgage Indenture which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions,
on substantially all of LG&E's real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection
with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the storage and distribution of natural gas. The aggregate
carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Includes KU's first mortgage bonds that are secured
by the lien of the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially
all of KU's real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission
and distribution of electricity. The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $5.7 billion and $5.5 billion
at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

(b)

Includes PPL Electric's series of senior secured bonds that secure its
obligations to make payments with respect to each series of Pollution Control Bonds that were issued by the LCIDA and the PEDFA
on behalf of PPL Electric. These senior secured bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption
provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such Pollution Control Bonds. These senior secured bonds were
issued under PPL Electric's 2001 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in (a) above. This amount includes $224 million that
may be redeemed at par beginning in 2015 and $90 million that may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par beginning in October
2020 and are subject to mandatory redemption upon determination that the interest rate on the bonds would be included in the holders'
gross income for federal tax purposes.

(c)

Includes LG&E's and KU's series of first mortgage bonds that were
issued to the respective trustees of tax-exempt revenue bonds to secure its respective obligations to make payments with respect
to each series of bonds. The first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amounts, contain payment and redemption provisions
that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds. These first mortgage bonds were issued under
the LG&E 2010 Mortgage Indenture and the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in (a) above. The related tax-exempt
revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in Kentucky, on behalf of LG&E and KU. The
related revenue bond documents allow LG&E and KU to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial
paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate, term rate of at least one year or, in some cases, an auction rate or a LIBOR index rate.

At December 31, 2015, the aggregate tax-exempt
revenue bonds issued on behalf of LG&E and KU that were in a term rate mode totaled $418 million for LKE, comprised of $391
million and $27 million for LG&E and KU, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued
on behalf of LG&E and KU that were in a variable rate mode totaled $507 million for LKE, comprised of $183 million and $324
million for LG&E and KU, respectively.

Several series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds are
insured by monoline bond insurers whose ratings were reduced due to exposures relating to insurance of sub-prime mortgages. Of
the bonds outstanding, $231 million are in the form of insured auction rate securities ($135 million for LG&E and $96 million
for KU), wherein interest rates are reset either weekly or every 35 days via an auction process. Beginning in late 2007, the interest
rates on these insured bonds began to increase due to investor concerns about the creditworthiness of the bond insurers. During
2008, interest rates increased, and LG&E and KU experienced failed auctions when there were insufficient bids for the bonds.
When a failed auction occurs, the interest rate is set pursuant to a formula stipulated in the indenture. As noted above, the instruments
governing these auction rate bonds permit LG&E and KU to convert the bonds to other interest rate modes.

Certain of the variable rate tax-exempt revenue bonds
totaling $251 million at December 31, 2015 ($23 million for LG&E and $228 million for KU), are subject to tender for purchase
by LG&E and KU at the option of the holder and to mandatory tender for purchase by LG&E and KU upon the occurrence of certain
events.

(d)

Includes ยฃ225
million ($339 million at December 31, 2015) of notes that may be redeemed, in total but not in part, on December 21, 2026,
at the greater of the principal value or a value determined by reference to the gross redemption yield on a nominated U.K. Government
bond.

(e)

The principal
amount of the notes issued by WPD (South West) and WPD (East Midlands) is adjusted based on changes in a specified index, as detailed
in the terms of the related indentures. The adjustment to the principal amounts from 2014 to 2015 was an increase of approximately
ยฃ4 million ($6 million) resulting from inflation. In addition, this amount includes ยฃ225 million ($339 million at December 31,
2015) of notes issued by



WPD (South West) that may be redeemed, in total by
series, on December 1, 2026, at the greater of the adjusted principal value and a make-whole value determined by reference to the
gross real yield on a nominated U.K. government bond.

(f)

Includes ยฃ4.4
billion ($6.6 billion at December 31, 2015) of notes that may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term
credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment
grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event which includes the loss of, or a material adverse
change to, the distribution licenses under which the issuer operates.

(g)

The table reflects principal maturities only, based on stated maturities or earlier put dates, and the weighted-average rates
as of December 31, 2015.

None of the outstanding debt securities noted above have sinking
fund requirements.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, based on

(PPL)

In May 2013, PPL Capital Funding remarketed $1.150 billion of
4.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018 that were originally issued in June 2010 as a component of PPL's 2010 Equity Units. In
connection with the remarketing, PPL Capital Funding issued $300 million of 2.04% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2016 and $850 million
of 2.77% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were simultaneously exchanged for three tranches of Senior Notes: $250 million
of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2018, $600 million of 3.40% Senior Notes due 2023 and $300 million of 4.70% Senior Notes due 2043. The
transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a $10 million loss on extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated
Notes, recorded to "Interest Expense" on the Statement of Income. The transaction was considered non-cash activity that
was excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, in July 2013, PPL issued 40 million
shares of common stock at $28.73 per share to settle the 2010 Purchase Contracts. PPL received net cash proceeds of $1.150 billion,
which were used to repay short-term and long-term debt and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2014, PPL Capital Funding remarketed $978 million of
4.32% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019 that were originally issued in April 2011 as a component of PPL's 2011 Equity Units. In
connection with the remarketing, PPL Capital Funding retired $228 million of the 4.32% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019

and issued $350 million of 2.189% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2017 and $400 million of 3.184% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019.
Simultaneously, the newly issued Junior Subordinated Notes were exchanged for $350 million of 3.95%

Senior
Notes due 2024 and $400 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2044. The transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting
in a $9 million loss on extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, recorded to "Interest Expense" on the Statement
of Income. Except for the $228 million retirement of the 4.32% Junior Subordinated Notes and fees related to the transactions,
the activity was non-cash and excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, in
May 2014, PPL issued 31.7 million shares of common stock at $30.86 per share to settle the 2011 Purchase Contracts. PPL received
net cash proceeds of $978 million, which were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.

In November 2015, WPD plc issued ยฃ500 million aggregate
nominal value of 3.625% Notes due 2023. WPD plc received proceeds of ยฃ495 million, which equated to $746 million at the time
of issuance, net of a discount and underwriting fees, which will be used for general corporate purposes, including the re-financing
of existing debt.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In October 2015, PPL Electric issued $350 million of 4.15% First
Mortgage Bonds due 2045. PPL Electric received proceeds of $345 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees, which were used
to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.

In December 2015, PPL Electric repaid the entire $100 million
principal amount of its 4.95% Senior Secured Bonds upon maturity.



(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

In September 2015, LG&E issued $300 million of 3.30% First
Mortgage Bonds due 2025 and $250 million of 4.375% First Mortgage Bonds due 2045. LG&E received proceeds of $298 million and
$248 million, net of discounts and underwriting fees, which were used to repay short-term debt, to repay 1.625% First Mortgage
Bonds that matured in November 2015 and for general corporate purposes.

(PPL, LKE and KU)

In September 2015, KU issued $250 million of 3.30% First Mortgage
Bonds due 2025 and $250 million of 4.375% First Mortgage Bonds due 2045. KU received proceeds of $248 million for each issuance,
net of discounts and underwriting fees, which were used to repay short-term debt, to repay 1.625% First Mortgage Bonds that matured
in November 2015 and for general corporate purposes.

(PPL and LKE)

In November 2015, LKE borrowed $400 million from a PPL affiliate
through the issuance of a 3.50% note payable due 2025. The proceeds were used to repay the entire $400 million principal amount
of its 2.125% Senior Unsecured Notes which matured in November 2015. See Note 14 for more information related to intercompany borrowings.

Legal
Separateness

(All Registrants)

The subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities. PPL's subsidiaries
are not liable for the debts of PPL. Accordingly, creditors of PPL may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL's subsidiaries
absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.
Similarly, PPL is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries, nor are its subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. Accordingly,
creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL or its other subsidiaries absent a specific
contractual undertaking by PPL or its other subsidiaries to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.

Similarly, the subsidiaries of PPL Electric and LKE are each
separate legal entities. These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL Electric and LKE. Accordingly, creditors of PPL
Electric and LKE may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by
a subsidiary to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. Similarly, PPL Electric and LKE are not liable
for the debts of their subsidiaries, nor are their subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. Accordingly, creditors of
these subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Electric and LKE (or their other subsidiaries) absent a specific
contractual undertaking by that parent or other subsidiary to pay such creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.

(PPL)

ATM Program

In February 2015, PPL entered into two separate equity distribution
agreements, pursuant to which PPL may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $500 million of its common stock. During 2015,
PPL issued 1,476,700 shares of common stock under the program at an average price of $33.41 per share, receiving net proceeds of
$49 million.

Distributions and Related Restrictions

In November 2015, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend,
payable January 4, 2016, at 37.75 cents per share (equivalent to $1.51 per annum). On February 4, 2016, PPL announced that the
company is increasing its common stock dividend to 38 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to $1.52 per annum). Future
dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal
requirements and other factors. See Note 8 for information regarding the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of a newly
formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock
of Talen Energy.

Neither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash
dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007
Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2015, no
interest payments were deferred.



WPD subsidiaries have financing arrangements that limit their
ability to pay dividends. However, PPL does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL's
ability to meet its cash obligations.

(All Registrants)

PPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund
PPL's dividends to its common shareholders. The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LKE primarily
relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its distributions to PPL. LG&E, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section
305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds "properly
included in capital account." The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act. LG&E,
KU and PPL Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed
or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and
legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in
the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments
for the acquisition of LKE by PPL. In May 2012, FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not
pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization. Accordingly, at
December 31, 2015, net assets of $2.7 billion ($1.1 billion for LG&E and $1.6 billion for KU) were restricted for purposes
of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $2.9 billion ($1.2 billion for LG&E and $1.7 billion for KU) were available for
payment of dividends to LKE. LG&E and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a
result of the foregoing requirement. In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without
the prior approval of the VSCC. There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LG&E and KU, or under Pennsylvania
law applicable to PPL Electric. However, orders from the KPSC require LG&E and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before
lending amounts to PPL.

8.
Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures

(All Registrants)

The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for
potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and
other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future
financial results.

(PPL)

Discontinued Operations

Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply

In June
2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and
immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company
named Talen Energy. The transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals from
the NRC, FERC, DOJ and PUC, all of which were received by mid-April 2015. On April 29, 2015, PPL's Board of Directors declared
the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of record on May 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing
owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.

Immediately following the spinoff on June 1, 2015, Holdco merged
with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply. Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger,
RJS Power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy. PPL shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares
of Talen Energy common stock for each share of PPL common stock they owned on May 20, 2015. Following completion of these transactions,
PPL shareowners owned 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%. The spinoff had no effect on the number of PPL
common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding. The transaction is intended to
be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

PPL has no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or
affiliation with Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly PPL Energy Supply).



Loss on Spinoff

In conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated
whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.

PPL considered several valuation methodologies to derive a fair
value estimate of its Supply segment at the spinoff date. These methodologies included considering the closing "when-issued"
Talen Energy market value on June 1, 2015 (the spinoff date), adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value attributable
to the Supply segment, as well as, the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments - an income
approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering market multiples
of comparable companies.

Although the market value of Talen Energy approach utilized
the most observable inputs of the three approaches, PPL considered certain limitations of the "when-issued" trading market
for the spinoff transaction including the short trading duration, lack of liquidity in the market and anticipated initial Talen
stock ownership base selling pressure, among other factors, and concluded that these factors limit the appropriateness of this
input being solely determinative of the fair value of the Supply segment. As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches
in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach.

The
following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:

A
key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the application of a control premium of 25% in the two market approaches.
PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was
followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply segment, which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This
guidance provides that the market price of an individual security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with
publically traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates
that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits
that arise from control over another entity, and that the market price of a Company's individual share of stock does not reflect
this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for
determining the fair value, and including a control premium is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit.

In determining the control premium, PPL reviewed premiums received
during the last five years in market sales transactions obtained from observable independent power producer and hybrid utility
transactions greater than $1 billion. Premiums for these transactions ranged from 5% to 42% with a median of approximately 25%.
Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of 25% to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.

Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included
forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions
used in the Energy Supply portion of the recent Talen Energy business planning process and a market participant discount rate.

Using these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the
estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of $4.1 billion and recorded a
loss on the spinoff of $879 million in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible
for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff
date.

Costs of Spinoff

Following the announcement of the transaction to form Talen
Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following
completion of the spinoff.  Organizational plans were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identified
the need to resize and restructure the organizations and as a result, in 2014, estimated charges of $36 million for employee separation
benefits were recorded related to 306 positions. Of this amount, $16 million related to 112 Energy Supply positions and is reflected
in discontinued operations.



The remaining $20 million is primarily reflected in "Other
operation and maintenance" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2015, the organizational structures were finalized
for both PPL and Talen Energy which resulted in an additional charge of $10 million for employee separation benefits. Of this amount,
$2 million related to Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $8 million is reflected
in "Other operation and maintenance" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. The separation benefits include cash
severance compensation, lump sum COBRA reimbursement payments and outplacement services.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014,
the recorded liabilities related to the separation benefits were $13 million and $20 million, which are included in "Other
current liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.

Additional employee-related costs incurred primarily included
accelerated stock-based compensation and prorated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily
for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL Services employees who became PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction.
PPL Energy Supply recognized $24 million of these costs at the spinoff closing date in 2015, which are reflected in discontinued
operations.

As the vesting for all PPL Energy Supply employees was accelerated
and all remaining unrecognized compensation expense accelerated concurrently with the spinoff, PPL does not expect to recognize
significant future compensation costs for equity awards held by former PPL Energy Supply employees. PPL's future stock-based compensation
expense will not be significantly impacted by equity award adjustments that occurred as a result of the spinoff. Stock-based compensation
expense recognized in future periods for PPL's outstanding awards will correspond to the unrecognized compensation expense as of
the date of the spinoff, which reflects the unamortized balance of the original grant date fair value of the equity awards held
by PPL employees.

PPL recorded $45 million and $27 million of third-party costs
related to this transaction in 2015 and 2014. Of these costs, $32 million and $19 million were primarily for bank advisory, legal
and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are reflected in discontinued operations. An additional $13 million and
$8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred in 2015 and 2014, related to the formation of the Talen Energy organization
and to reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions. These costs are recorded primarily in "Other operation and maintenance"
on the Statements of Income. No significant additional third-party costs are expected to be incurred.

At the close of the transaction in 2015, $72 million
($42

million after-tax) of cash flow hedges, primarily unamortized losses on PPL interest rate swaps recorded in AOCI
and designated as cash flow hedges of PPL Energy Supply's future interest payments, were reclassified into interest expense
and reflected in discontinued operations.

As a result of the June 2014 spinoff announcement, PPL recorded
$50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net
operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.

Continuing
Involvement

(PPL and PPL Electric)

As a result of the spinoff, PPL and PPL Energy Supply entered
into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) that terminates no later than two years from the spinoff date. The TSA sets forth the
terms and conditions for PPL and Talen Energy to provide certain transition services to one another. PPL will provide Talen Energy
certain information technology, financial and accounting, human resource and other specified services. In 2015, PPL billed $25
million to Talen Energy for these services. In general, the fees for the transition services allow the provider to recover its
cost of the services, including overheads, but without margin or profit.

Additionally, prior to the spinoff, through the annual competitive
solicitation process, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded supply contracts for a portion of the PLR generation supply for PPL Electric,
which were retained by Talen Energy Marketing as part of the spinoff transaction. PPL Electric's supply contracts with Talen Energy
Marketing extend through November 2016. The energy purchases were previously included in PPL Electric's Statements of Income as
"Energy purchases from affiliate" but were eliminated in PPL's Consolidated Statements of Income.

Subsequent to the spinoff, PPL Electric's energy purchases from
Talen Energy Marketing were $27 million and are no longer considered affiliate transactions.

Montana Hydro Sale

In November 2014, PPL Montana completed the sale to NorthWestern
of 633 MW of hydroelectric generating facilities located in Montana for approximately $900 million in cash. The proceeds from the
sale remained with PPL and did not transfer to Talen Energy as a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. The sale included
11 hydroelectric power facilities and related assets, included in the Supply segment. A gain of $237 million ($137 million after-tax)
was recorded on the sale of the hydroelectric power facilities.

In December 2013, to facilitate the sale of the Montana hydroelectric
generating facilities, PPL Montana terminated its operating lease arrangement related to partial interests in the Colstrip coal-fired
electric generating facility and acquired those interests collectively for $271 million. A loss of $697 million ($413 million after-tax)
was recorded for the termination of the lease arrangement.

As the Montana hydroelectric power facilities were previously
reported as a component of PPL Energy Supply and the Supply segment, the components of discontinued operations for these facilities
contained in the Statements of Income are included in the disclosure above.

Development

Regional
Transmission Line Expansion Plan

(PPL and PPL Electric)

Susquehanna-Roseland

In 2007, PJM directed the construction of a new 150-mile, 500-kV
transmission line between the Susquehanna substation in Pennsylvania and the Roseland substation in New Jersey that it identified
as essential to long-term reliability of the Mid-Atlantic electricity grid. PJM determined that the line was needed to prevent
potential overloads that could occur on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM system. PJM directed PPL
Electric to construct the Pennsylvania portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland line and Public Service Electric & Gas Company to
construct the New Jersey portion of the line. The line was energized, in May 2015. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $648 million
and $597 million of costs were capitalized and are included on the Balance Sheet primarily in "Regulated utility plant"
for 2015 and "Construction work in progress" for 2014.

Northeast/Pocono

In October 2012, the FERC issued an order in response to PPL
Electric's December 2011 request for ratemaking incentives for the Northeast/Pocono Reliability project (a new 58-mile, 230 kV
transmission line that includes three new substations and upgrades to adjacent facilities). The FERC granted the incentive for
inclusion in rate base of all prudently incurred construction work in progress (CWIP) costs but denied the requested incentive
for a 100 basis point adder to the return on equity.

In December 2012, PPL Electric submitted an application to the
PUC requesting permission to site and construct the project. In January 2014, the PUC issued a Final Order approving the application.
PPL Electric expects the project to be completed



in 2016. At December 31, 2015, PPL Electric's estimated
cost of the project was $335 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $319 million and $183 million of costs were capitalized
and are included on the Balance Sheet primarily in "Regulated utility plant" for 2015 and "Construction work in
progress" for 2014.

Capacity
Needs

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

The Cane Run Unit 7 NGCC was put into commercial operation on
June 19, 2015. As a result and to meet more stringent EPA regulations, LG&E retired one coal-fired generating unit at the Cane
Run plant in March 2015 and retired the remaining two coal-fired generating units at the plant in June 2015. Additionally, KU retired
the remaining two coal-fired generating units at the Green River plant on September 30, 2015. LG&E and KU incurred costs of
$11 million and $6 million, respectively, directly related to these retirements including inventory write-downs and separation
benefits. However, there were no gains or losses on the retirement of these units. See Note 6 for more information related to the
regulatory recovery of the costs associated with the retirement of the Green River units.

In December 2014, a final order was issued by the KPSC approving
the request to construct a 10 MW solar generation facility at E.W. Brown. LG&E and KU began construction activities in the
fourth quarter of 2015 and project the plant to be placed into commercial operation by June 2016 at a cost of approximately $30
million.

Stock-Based Compensation

(PPL, PPL Electric and LKE)

In 2012, shareowners approved the SIP. This equity plan replaced
the ICP and incorporated the following changes:

ยท

Eliminates the potential to pay dividend equivalents on stock options.

ยท

Eliminates the automatic lapse of restrictions on all equity awards in the event of a "potential" change in control
and requires that a termination of employment occur in the event of a change in control before restrictions lapse.

ยท

Changes the treatment of outstanding stock options upon retirement to limit the exercise period to the earlier of the end of
the term (ten years from grant) or five years after retirement.



To further align the executives' interests with those of PPL
shareowners, this plan provides that each restricted stock unit entitles the executive to accrue additional restricted stock units
equal to the amount of quarterly dividends paid on PPL stock. These additional restricted stock units are deferred and payable
in shares of PPL common stock at the end of the restriction period. Dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards granted
under the ICP and the ICPKE are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by PPL.

Under the ICP, SIP and the ICPKE (together, the Plans), restricted
shares of PPL common stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be granted to officers and other key
employees of PPL, PPL Electric, LKE and other affiliated companies. Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation, Governance
and Nominating Committee (CGNC) of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of the ICP and SIP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership
Council (CLC), in the case of the ICPKE.

Any portion of these awards that has not been granted may be
carried over and used in any subsequent year. If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the
shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again available for grant. Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the
form of authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL or PPL common stock purchased on the open
market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares
with full voting and dividend rights. Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for select key executives and vest
when the recipient reaches a certain age or meets service or other criteria set forth in the executive's restricted stock award
agreement.

The Plans allow for the grant of restricted stock units. Restricted
stock units are awards based on the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant. Actual PPL common shares will be issued
upon completion of a restriction period, generally three years.

The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units
granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement
eligibility. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized
as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. Recipients of restricted stock units granted under the ICPKE may also
be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited.
Restricted stock and restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination,
retirement, disability and death of employees. Restrictions lapse on restricted stock and restricted stock units fully, in certain
situations, as defined by each of the Plans.

Performance
Units

Performance units are intended to encourage and reward future
corporate performance. Performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient
would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance goal. Performance is determined based on total shareowner return
during a three-year performance period. At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the total
shareowner return of the companies included in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Utility Index. Awards are payable on a graduated
basis based on thresholds that measure PPL's performance relative to peers that comprise the applicable index on which each years'
awards are measured. Awards can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum
established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional
performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the determination
of the CGNC of whether the performance goals have been achieved. Under the plan provisions, performance units are subject to forfeiture
upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units
remain outstanding and are eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance period.

Beginning in 2014, the fair value of performance units granted
to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a one-year period, the minimum
vesting period required for an employee to be entitled to payout of the awards. For employees who are not retirement-eligible,
compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the three-year performance period or the period until the employee is retirement-eligible,
with a minimum vesting and recognition period of one-year. The fair value of performance units granted in 2013 and prior years
is recognized



as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year
performance period. Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.

The
fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free
interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life. The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual
securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group. The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury
bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit. Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is
calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration
given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies
in the index group. PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards.

The total fair value of performance units vesting for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $6 million and $5 million for PPL and insignificant for PPL Electric and LKE.



Stock Options

PPL's CGNC eliminated the use of stock options and changed its
long-term incentive mix to 60% performance units and 40% performance-contingent restricted stock units, resulting in 100% performance-based
long-term incentive mix for equity awards granted beginning in January 2014

.

Under the Plans, stock options had been granted with an option
exercise price per share not less than the fair value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant. Options outstanding at December 31,
2015, become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year service period beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming
the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary. The CGNC and CLC have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the
options, except that the exercisability of an option issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless the individual remains
employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the date of grant. All options expire no later than ten years from the grant
date. The options become exercisable immediately in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. The fair value of options
granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the
employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value of options granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation
expense immediately upon the date of grant.

The
fair value of each option granted is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. PPL uses a risk-free interest rate,
expected option life, expected volatility and dividend yield to value its stock options. The risk-free interest rate reflects the
yield for a U.S. Treasury Strip available on the date of grant with constant rate maturity approximating the option's expected
life. Expected life is calculated based on historical exercise behavior. Volatility over the expected term of the options is evaluated
with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL's
volatility in those prior periods. Management's expectations for future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL's business
model and other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data to determine the final volatility assumption.
PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards. The dividend yield is based on several factors, including PPL's
most recent dividend payment, as of the grant date and the forecasted stock price.

The
assumptions used in the model were:


Risk-free interest rate

1.15%

Expected option life

6.48 years

Expected stock volatility

18.50%

Retirement and Postemployment Benefits

(All Registrants)

Defined Benefits

The majority of PPL's subsidiaries domestic employees are eligible
for pension benefits under non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of service and final average
pay, as defined by the plans. Effective January 1, 2012, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired
salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining
unit employees. Newly hired employees are eligible to participate in the PPL Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) savings plan with
enhanced employer contributions.

The defined benefit pension plans of LKE and its subsidiaries
were closed to new salaried and bargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2005. Employees hired after December 31, 2005
receive additional company contributions above the standard matching contributions to their savings plans.

Effective April 1, 2010, the principal defined benefit pension
plan applicable to WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) was closed to most new employees, except for those meeting specific grandfathered
participation rights. WPD Midlands' defined benefit plan had been closed to new members, except for those meeting specific grandfathered
participation rights, prior to acquisition. New employees not eligible to participate in the plans are offered benefits under a
defined contribution plan.

PPL and certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental
retirement benefits to executives and other key management employees through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans.

The majority of employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries are
eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through contributory plans. Effective January 1, 2014,
the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement
Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Postretirement health benefits may be paid from 401(h) accounts
established as part of the PPL Retirement Plan and the LG&E and KU Retirement Plan within the PPL Services Corporation Master
Trust, funded VEBA trusts and company funds. WPD does not sponsor any postretirement benefit plans other than pensions.

(PPL,
LKE and LG&E)

PPL, LKE and LG&E adopted the new mortality tables issued
by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 (RP-2014 base tables) for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefit plans at December 31, 2015. In addition, PPL, LKE and LG&E updated the basis for estimating projected mortality
improvements and selected the IRS BB-2D two-dimensional improvement scale on a generational basis for all U.S. defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These new mortality assumptions reflect the recognition of both improved life expectancies
and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies. The use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted
in an increase to U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, an increase to future expense and
a decrease in funded status.

The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations at December 31. The U.K. pension

to receive their accrued pension benefit as a one-time lump-sum payment effective January 1, 2016. The projected benefit obligation
increased by $19 million as a result of the amendment.



The plans were amended in December 2014 to enhance
the early retirement factors for all plan participants retiring on or after January 1, 2015. These modifications resulted in an
increase of $23 million in the plans' projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2014.

(b)

Certain LKE pension plans offered a limited-time program in 2014 during
which terminated vested participants could elect to receive their accrued pension benefit as a one-time lump-sum payment. The gross

Plan
Assets - U.S. Pension Plans

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

PPL's primary legacy pension plan and the pension plans sponsored
by LKE are invested in the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust (the Master Trust) that also includes 401(h) accounts that are
restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations of PPL and LKE. The investment strategy for the Master Trust is
to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with PPL's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient
assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments, while also managing the duration of the assets
to complement the duration of the liabilities. The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment
fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk.

The investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment
objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian.
The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's Board of Directors.

The EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust
assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing
and liquidity portfolios. The growth



portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return
at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio
consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset
a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily
of cash and cash equivalents.

Target allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio
on a plan basis based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the
investments in each portfolio on a plan basis, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss
from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines
as of the end of 2015 are presented below.

The
asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows:

are invested solely in the Master Trust, which is fully disclosed below. The fair value of these plans' assets of $1.3 billion
at December 31, 2015 and 2014 represents an interest of approximately 40% and 28% in the Master Trust.

LG&E has a pension plan whose assets are invested solely
in the Master Trust, which is fully disclosed below. The fair value of this plan's assets of $297 million and $301 million at December 31,

The fair
value measurements of cash and cash equivalents are based on the amounts on deposit.

The market approach is used to measure fair value of equity
securities. The fair value measurements of equity securities (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level
1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are
managed against various equity indices and exchange traded funds (ETFs).

Investments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized
as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities.
Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations,
as well as funds that invest in investment grade long-duration fixed-income securities.



The fair value measurements of debt securities are generally
based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for
similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market
approach, including the use of pricing models which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant
trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value
of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data,
future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments
in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages,
auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S.
companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations.

Investments in commodities represent ownership interest of a
commingled fund that is invested in a portfolio of exchange-traded futures and forward contracts in commodities to obtain broad
exposure to all principal groups in the global commodity markets, including energies, agriculture and metals (both precious and
industrial) using proprietary commodity trading strategies. Redemptions can be made the 15

th

calendar day and the last
calendar day of the month with a specified notification period. The fund's fair value is based upon a value as calculated by the
fund's administrator.

Investments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership
whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property
types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The manager is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants.
This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor. Core real estate generally
has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies. The partnership has limitations
on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline
to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among
others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.

Investments in private equity represent interests in partnerships
in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies.
Four of the partnerships have limited lives of ten years, while the fifth has a life of 15 years, after which liquidating distributions
will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however,
the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. The Master Trust has unfunded commitments
of $27 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners'
capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.

Investments in hedge funds represent investments in three hedge
fund of funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined aim
to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies
for the hedge fund of funds include long/short equity, market neutral, distressed debt, and relative value. Generally, shares may
be redeemed within 60 to 95 days with prior written notice. The funds are subject to short term lockups and have limitations on
the amount that may be withdrawn based on a percentage of the total net asset value of the fund, among other restrictions. All
withdrawals are subject to the general partner's approval. The fair value for two of the funds has been estimated using the net
asset value per share and the third fund's fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate
share of net assets is attributed.

The fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize
various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments
may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily
represent investments in interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap) which are valued based
on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver
credit ratings.

Insurance contracts, classified as Level 3, represent an investment
in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract. The fair value is based on contract value, which represents cost
plus interest income less distributions for benefit payments and administrative expenses.

Plan Assets - U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The investment strategy with respect to other postretirement
benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient
manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of
assets for long-term growth with an objective of



earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit
payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers, and
therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds.
Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated
as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as
cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.

The
asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts, excluding LKE, and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31 are detailed

As a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, $80 million of assets were transferred to Talen
Energy in 2015, attributable to former active employees of PPL Energy Supply that had participated in PPL's other postretirement

Investments in money market funds represent investments in funds
that invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment grade money market instruments, including, but not limited to, commercial
paper, notes, repurchase agreements and other evidences of indebtedness with a maturity not exceeding 13 months from the date of
purchase. The primary objective of the fund is a level of current income consistent with stability of principal and liquidity.
Redemptions can be made daily on this fund.

Investments in large-cap equity securities represent investments
in a passively managed equity index fund that invests in securities and a combination of other collective funds. Fair value measurements
are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market but are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share as provided
by the trustee of the fund. Redemptions can be made daily on this fund.

Investments in commingled debt securities represent investments
in a fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of investment grade long-duration fixed income securities. Redemptions can be
made weekly on these funds.

Investments in municipalities represent investments in a diverse
mix of tax-exempt municipal securities. The fair value measurements for these securities are based on recently executed transactions
for identical securities or for similar securities.



Plan
Assets - U.K. Pension Plans

(PPL)

The overall investment strategy of WPD's pension plans is developed
by each plan's independent trustees in its Statement of Investment Principles in compliance with the U.K. Pensions Act of 1995
and other U.K. legislation. The trustees' primary focus is to ensure that assets are sufficient to meet members' benefits as they
fall due with a longer term objective to reduce investment risk. The investment strategy is intended to maximize investment returns
while not incurring excessive volatility in the funding position. WPD's plans are invested in a wide diversification of asset types,
fund strategies and fund managers; and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Commingled funds that consist entirely
of debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by WPD as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation
purposes. These include investments in U.K. corporate bonds and U.K. gilts.

Except for investments in real estate, the fair value measurements
of WPD's pension plan assets are based on the same inputs and measurement techniques used to measure the U.S. pension plan assets
described above.



Investments in equity securities represent actively and passively
managed funds that are measured against various equity indices. Other comprises a range of investment strategies which invest in
a variety of assets including equities, bonds, currencies, real estate and forestry held in unitized funds.

U.K. corporate bonds include investment grade corporate bonds
of companies from diversified U.K. industries.

U.K. gilts include gilts, index-linked gilts and swaps intended
to track a portion of the plans' liabilities.

Investments in real estate represent holdings in a U.K. unitized
fund that owns and manages U.K. industrial and commercial real estate with a strategy of earning current rental income and achieving
capital growth. The fair value measurement of the fund is based upon a net asset value per share, which is based on the value of
underlying properties that are independently appraised in accordance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards
at least annually with quarterly valuation updates based on recent sales of similar properties, leasing levels, property operations
and/or market conditions. The fund may be subject to redemption restrictions in the unlikely event of a large forced sale in order
to ensure other unit holders are not disadvantaged.

Expected
Cash Flows - U.S. Defined Benefit Plans

(PPL)

PPL's U.S. defined benefit pension plans have the option to
utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. However, PPL contributed $30
million to its U.S. pension plans in January 2016.

PPL sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans
for which no assets are segregated from corporate assets. PPL expects to make approximately $10 million of benefit payments under
these plans in 2016.

PPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement
benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized. Continuation
of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $13 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2016.

The following

Separation
Benefits

Certain PPL subsidiaries provide separation benefits to eligible
employees. These benefits may be provided in the case of separations due to performance issues, loss of job related qualifications
or organizational changes. Until December 1, 2012, certain employees separated were eligible for cash severance payments, outplacement
services, accelerated stock award



vesting, continuation of group health and welfare coverage,
and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits. As of December 1, 2012, separation benefits for certain employees were
changed to eliminate accelerated stock award vesting and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits. Also, the continuation
of group health and welfare coverage was replaced with a single sum payment approximating the dollar amount of premium payments
that would be incurred for continuation of group health and welfare coverage. Separation benefits are recorded when such amounts
are probable and estimable.

See Note 8 for a discussion of separation benefits recognized
in 2015 and 2014 related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. Separation benefits were not significant in 2013.

Cane Run Environmental Claims

In December 2013, six residents, on behalf of themselves
and others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against LG&E and PPL in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Kentucky alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and RCRA. In addition, these plaintiffs assert common
law claims of nuisance, trespass and negligence. These plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and civil penalties, plus costs and
attorney fees, for the alleged statutory violations. Under the common law claims, these plaintiffs seek monetary compensation
and punitive damages for property damage and diminished property values for a class consisting of residents within four miles
of the plant. In their individual capacities, these plaintiffs seek compensation for alleged adverse health effects. In
response to a motion to dismiss filed by PPL and LG&E, in July 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' RCRA claims and
all but one Clean Air Act claim, but declined to dismiss their common law tort claims. Upon motion of LG&E and PPL, the
district court certified for appellate review the issue of whether the state common law claims are preempted by federal
statute. In December 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting appellate review
regarding the above matter. Oral argument before the Sixth Circuit was held in August 2015. In November 2015, the Sixth
Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court's ruling that plaintiffs' state law claims are not preempted by the
Clean Air Act and remanding the matter to the District Court for further proceedings.  Certain discovery matters are
currently before the District Court. PPL, LKE and LG&E cannot predict the outcome of this matter. LG&E retired
one coal-fired unit at the Cane Run plant in March 2015 and the remaining two coal-fired units at the plant in June 2015.

Mill Creek Environmental Claims

In May 2014, the Sierra Club filed a citizen suit against LG&E
in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. The Sierra Club
alleges that various discharges at the Mill Creek plant constitute violations of the plant's water discharge permit. The Sierra
Club seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief, costs and attorney's fees. In August 2015, the Court denied cross-motions for summary
judgment filed by both parties and directed the parties to proceed with discovery. Discovery proceedings are underway and the parties
have also conducted limited settlement discussions in the matter. PPL, LKE and LG&E cannot predict the outcome of this matter
or the potential impact on the operations of the Mill Creek plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any, but
believe the plant is operating in compliance with the permits.

E.W. Brown Environmental Claims

In October 2015, KU received a notice of intent from Earthjustice
and the Sierra Club informing certain federal and state agencies of the Sierra Club's intent to file a citizen suit, following
expiration of the mandatory 60-day notification period, for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. The claimant alleges discharges
at the E.W. Brown plant in violation of applicable rules and the plant's water discharge permit. The claimant asserts that, unless
the alleged discharges are promptly brought into compliance, it intends to seek civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's
fees. In November 2015, the claimants submitted an amended notice of intent to add the Kentucky Waterways Alliance as a claimant.
The parties have conducted limited settlement discussions in the matter. PPL, LKE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter
or the potential impact on the operations of the E. W. Brown plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any.

Trimble County Unit 2 Air Permit

The Sierra Club and other environmental groups petitioned the
Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to overturn the air permit issued for the Trimble County Unit 2 baseload coal-fired
generating unit, but the agency upheld the permit in an order issued in September 2007.  In response to subsequent petitions
by environmental groups, the EPA ordered certain non-material changes to the permit which, in January 2010, were incorporated into
a final revised permit issued by the Kentucky Division for Air Quality.  In March 2010, the environmental groups petitioned
the EPA to object to the revised state permit.  Until the EPA issues a final ruling on the pending petition and all available
appeals are exhausted, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the operations
of the Trimble County plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any.

Trimble County Water Discharge Permit

In May 2010, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and other environmental
groups filed a petition with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) challenging the Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System permit issued in April



2010, which covers water discharges from the Trimble
County plant.  In November 2010, the KEEC issued a final order upholding the permit which was subsequently appealed by
the environmental groups.  In September 2013, the Franklin Circuit Court reversed the KEEC order upholding the permit
and remanded the permit to the agency for further proceedings.  LG&E and the KEEC appealed the order to the Kentucky
Court of Appeals.  In July 2015, the Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling.  LG&E and the KEEC have
moved for discretionary review by the Kentucky Supreme Court. On February 10, 2016, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued an
order granting discretionary review. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or
the potential impact on the operations of the Trimble County plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if
any.

Regulatory Issues

(All
Registrants)

See Note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to
utility rate regulation.

Electricity - Reliability Standards

The NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory
reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk power system. The FERC oversees this process and independently
enforces the Reliability Standards.

The Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and
apply to certain users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under
the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, per violation, for certain violations.

PPL, LG&E, KU and PPL Electric monitor their compliance
with the Reliability Standards and continue to self-report or self-log potential violations of certain applicable reliability requirements
and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Any
Regional Reliability Entity (including RFC or SERC) determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards
remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC.

In the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance
with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance
may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of
reasonably possible losses, if any.

Environmental
Matters - Domestic

(All Registrants)

Due to the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental
matters, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify, curtail, replace or cease operation of certain facilities or performance
of certain operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition,
legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add to the uncertainty of estimating the future cost of these permits and
rules.

LG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism,
certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and those federal, state or local environmental requirements applicable
to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities that generate electricity from coal in accordance with approved compliance
plans. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery
before the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because PPL Electric does not own any
generating plants, its exposure to related environmental compliance costs is reduced. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can
provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Air

The Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollutants from mobile
and stationary sources, has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically
to review and establish concentration levels in the ambient air for six criteria pollutants to protect public health and welfare.
These concentration levels are known as NAAQS. The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone,
particulate matter and sulfur dioxide.



Federal environmental regulations of these criteria pollutants
require states to adopt implementation plans, known as state implementation plans, for certain pollutants, which detail how the
state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation. Each state identifies the areas within its
boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas), and must develop a state implementation
plan both to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas. In
addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, states in the eastern portion of the country, including Kentucky,
are subject to a regional program developed by the EPA known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The NAAQS, future revisions
to the NAAQS and state implementation plans implementing them, or future revisions to regional programs, may require installation
of additional pollution controls, the costs of which PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU believe are subject to cost recovery.

Although PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU do not currently anticipate
significant costs to comply with these programs, changes in market or operating conditions could result in different costs than
anticipated.

National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to reassess the
NAAQS for certain air pollutants on a five-year schedule. In 2008, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone and proposed to further
strengthen the standard in November 2014. The EPA released a new ozone standard on October 1, 2015. The states and EPA will
determine attainment with the new ozone standard through review of relevant ambient air monitoring data, with attainment or nonattainment
designations scheduled no later than October 2017. States are also obligated to address interstate transport issues associated
with new ozone standards through the establishment of "good neighbor" state implementation plans for those states that
are found to contribute significantly to another states' non-attainment. States that are not in the ozone transport region, including
Kentucky, are working together to evaluate further nitrogen oxide reductions from fossil-fueled plants with SCRs. The nature and
timing of any additional reductions resulting from these evaluations cannot be predicted at this time.

In 2010, the EPA finalized revised NAAQS for sulfur dioxide
and required states to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in "non-attainment". In July 2013,
the EPA finalized non-attainment designations for parts of the country, including part of Jefferson County in Kentucky. Attainment
must be achieved by 2018

.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU anticipate that
certain previously required compliance measures, such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide scrubbers at certain plants and the retirement
of coal-fired generating units at LG&E's Cane Run plant and KU's Green River plant, will help to achieve compliance with the
new sulfur dioxide and ozone standards. If additional reductions are required, the costs could be significant.

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)

In February 2012, the EPA finalized the MATS rule requiring
reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil-fuel fired power plants, with an effective date of April 16,
2012. The MATS rule was challenged by industry groups and states and was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit
Court (D.C. Circuit Court) in April 2014. A group of states subsequently petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court) to review
this decision and in June 2015, the Supreme Court held that the EPA failed to properly consider costs when deciding to regulate
hazardous air emissions from power plants under MATS.  The Court remanded the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court, which in December
2015 remanded the rule to EPA without vacating it. EPA has proposed a supplemental finding regarding costs of the rule and has
announced that it intends to make a final determination in 2016. The EPA's MATS rule remains in effect during the pendency of the
ongoing proceedings.

LG&E and KU have installed significant controls in connection
with the MATS rule and in conjunction with compliance with other environmental requirements, including fabric-filter baghouses,
upgraded scrubbers or chemical additive systems for which appropriate KPSC authorization and/or ECR treatment has been received.
LG&E and KU are currently seeking KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for installation of additional MATS-related
controls, the cost of which is currently estimated at $5 million for LG&E and at $17 million for KU. PPL, LKE, LG&E and
KU cannot predict the outcome of the MATS rule or its potential impact, if any, on plant operations, rate treatment or future capital
or operating needs. See Note 6 for additional information.

New Source Review (NSR)

The NSR litigation brought by EPA, states and environmental
groups against coal-fired generating plants in past years continues to proceed through the courts. Although none of this litigation
directly involves PPL, LKE, LG&E or KU, it can



influence the permitting of large capital projects at LG&E
and KU's power plants, the costs of which cannot presently be determined but could be significant.

Climate Change

(All Registrants)

There is continuing momentum to address climate change. Most
recently,

in December 2015, 195 nations, including the U.S., signed
the Paris Agreement on Climate which establishes a comprehensive framework for the reduction of GHG emissions from both developed
and developing nations. Although the agreement does not establish binding reduction requirements, it requires each nation to prepare,
communicate, and maintain GHG reduction commitments. Based on EPA's Clean Power Plan described below, the U.S. has committed to
an initial reduction target of 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.

The EPA's Rules under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act

As further described below, the EPA finalized
rules imposing greenhouse gas emission standards for both new and existing power plants. The EPA has also issued a proposed
federal implementation plan that would apply to any states that fail to submit an acceptable state implementation plan under
these rules. The EPA's authority to promulgate these regulations under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been challenged
in the D.C. Circuit Court by several states and industry groups. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the rule for
existing plants (the Clean Power Plan) pending the D.C. Circuit Court's review and subsequent review by the Supreme Court if
a writ of certiorari is filed and granted.

The EPA's rule for new power plants imposes separate emission
standards for coal and natural gas units based on the application of different technologies. The coal standard is based on the
application of partial carbon capture and sequestration technology, but because this technology is not presently commercially available,
the rule effectively precludes the construction of new coal-fired plants. The standard for NGCC power plants is the same as the
EPA proposed in 2012 and is not continuously achievable. The preclusion of new coal-fired plants and the compliance difficulties
posed for new natural gas-fired plants could have a significant industry-wide impact.

The EPA's Clean Power Plan

The EPA's rule for existing power plants, referred to as the
Clean Power Plan, was published in the Federal Register in October 2015. The Clean Power Plan contains state-specific rate-based
and mass-based reduction goals and guidelines for the development, submission and implementation of state implementation plans
to achieve the state goals. State-specific goals were calculated from 2012 data by applying EPA's broad interpretation and definition
of the BSER, resulting in the most stringent targets to be met in 2030, with interim targets to be met beginning in 2022. The EPA
believes it has offered some flexibility to the states as to how their compliance plans can be crafted, including the option to
use a rate-based approach (limit emissions per megawatt hour) or a mass-based approach (limit total tons of emissions per year),
and the option to demonstrate compliance through emissions trading and multi-state collaborations. Under the rate-based approach,
Kentucky would need to make a 41% reduction from its 2012 emissions rate and under a mass-based approach it would need to make
a 36% reduction. These reductions are significantly greater than initially proposed and present significant challenges to the state.
If the Clean Power Plan is ultimately upheld and Kentucky fails to develop an approvable implementation plan by the applicable
deadline, the EPA would impose a federal implementation plan that could be more stringent than what the state plan might provide.
Depending on the provisions of the Kentucky implementation plan, LG&E and KU may need to modify their current portfolio of
generating assets during the next decade and/or participate in an allowance trading program.

LG&E and KU are participating in the ongoing regulatory
processes at the state and federal level in an effort to provide input into the state or federal implementation plan that will
govern reductions in Kentucky. Various states, industry groups, and individual companies including LKE have filed petitions for
reconsideration with EPA and petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the Clean Power Plan. PPL, LKE, LG&E
and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact, if any, on plant operations, or future capital or operating
needs. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU believe that the costs, which could be significant, would be subject to cost recovery.

In April 2014, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation
which limits the measures that the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet may consider in setting performance standards to comply
with the EPA's regulations governing GHG emissions from existing sources. The legislation provides that such state GHG performance
standards shall be based on emission reductions, efficiency measures, and other improvements available at each power plant, rather
than renewable



energy, end-use energy efficiency, fuel switching and re-dispatch.
These statutory restrictions may make it more difficult for Kentucky to achieve the GHG reduction levels that the EPA has established
for Kentucky.

Water/Waste

Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs)

On April 17, 2015, the EPA published its final rule regulating
CCRs. CCRs include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The rule became effective on October 19, 2015. It imposes
extensive new requirements, including location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective
action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements on CCR impoundments and landfills that are located on active
power plants and not closed. Under the rule, the EPA will regulate CCRs as non-hazardous under Subtitle D of RCRA and allow beneficial
use of CCRs, with some restrictions. The rule's requirements for covered CCR impoundments and landfills include implementation
of groundwater monitoring and commencement or completion of closure activities generally between three and ten years from certain
triggering events. This self-implementing rule requires posting of compliance documentation on a publicly accessible website and
is enforceable solely through citizen suits. LG&E and KU are also subject to state rules applicable to CCR management which
may potentially be modified to reflect some or all requirements of the federal rule.

LG&E and KU are currently pursuing KPSC approval for a compliance
plan providing for construction of additional landfill capacity at the Brown Station, closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek,
Trimble County, Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition
to the foregoing measures required for compliance with federal CCR rule requirements, LG&E and KU are also proposing to close
impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville, and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law requirements. PPL, LKE,
LG&E, and KU currently estimate the cost of these CCR compliance measures at $311 million for LG&E and $661 million for
KU. See Note 6 for additional information.

In connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded
increases to existing AROs during 2015. See Note 19 for additional information. Further increases to AROs or changes to current
capital plans or to operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring
results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are subject to rate recovery.

Clean Water Act

Regulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting
and mitigation requirements for many of LG&E's and KU's construction projects. Many of those requirements relate to power plant
operations, including requirements related to the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent
discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, standards intended
to protect aquatic organisms by reducing capture in the screens attached to cooling water intake structures (impingement) at generating
facilities and the water volume brought into the facilities (entrainment). The requirements could impose significant costs which
are subject to rate recovery.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs)

On September 30, 2015, the EPA released its final effluent limitations
guidelines for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electric generating facilities. The rule provides strict
technology-based discharge limitations for control of pollutants in scrubber wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water,
mercury control wastewater, gasification wastewater, and combustion residual leachate. The new guidelines require deployment of
additional control technologies providing physical, chemical, and biological treatment of wastewaters. The guidelines also mandate
operational changes including "no discharge" requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport waters and mercury control
wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations will be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis
according to criteria provided by the EPA, but the requirements of the rule must be fully implemented no later than 2023. It has
not been decided how Kentucky intends to integrate the ELGs into its routine permit renewal process. LG&E and KU continue to
assess the requirements of this complex rule to determine available compliance strategies. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable
to fully estimate compliance costs or timing at this time although certain preliminary estimates are included in current capital
forecasts, for applicable periods. Costs to comply with ELGs or other discharge limits, which are expected to be significant, are
subject to rate recovery.



(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

Clean Water Act Section 316(b)

The EPA's final 316(b) rule for existing facilities became effective
in October 2014, and regulates cooling water intake structures and their impact on aquatic organisms. States are allowed broad
discretion to make site-specific determinations under the rule. The rule requires existing facilities to choose between several
options to reduce the impact to aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens (impingement) and to determine
the intake structure's impact on aquatic organisms pulled through a plant's cooling water system (entrainment). Plants equipped
with closed-cycle cooling, an acceptable option, would likely not incur substantial costs. Once-through systems would likely require
additional technology to comply with the rule. Mill Creek Unit 1 is the only unit expected to be impacted. PPL, LKE, and LG&E
are evaluating compliance strategies but do not presently expect the compliance costs, which are subject to rate recovery, to be
significant.

(All Registrants)

Waters of the United States (WOTUS)

T

he
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has issued a stay of EPA's rule on the definition of WOTUS pending the court's review
of the rule. The effect of the stay is that the WOTUS rule is not currently in effect anywhere in the United States. The ultimate
outcome of the court's review of the rule remains uncertain. The Registrants do not expect the rule to have a significant impact
on their operations.

Other Issues

The EPA is reassessing its polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) regulations
under the Toxic Substance Control Act, which currently allow certain PCB articles to remain in use. In April 2010, the EPA issued
an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for changes to these regulations. This rulemaking could lead to a phase-out of all or
some PCB-containing equipment. The EPA has postponed the release of the revised regulations to March 2016. The Registrants cannot
predict at this time the outcome of these proposed EPA regulations and what impact, if any, they would have on their facilities,
but the costs could be significant.

Superfund
and Other Remediation

(All Registrants)

PPL Electric is potentially responsible for costs at several
sites listed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant site, the Metal Bank site and the
Brodhead site. Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant
to PPL Electric. Should the EPA require different or additional measures in the future, however, or should PPL Electric's share
of costs at multi-party sites increase substantially more than currently expected, the costs could be significant.

PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are investigating, responding
to agency inquiries, remediating, or have completed the remediation of, several sites that were not addressed under a regulatory
program such as Superfund, but for which PPL Electric, LG&E and KU may be liable for remediation. These include a number of
former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated or currently owned by predecessors
or affiliates of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU. To date, the costs of these sites have not been significant.

There are additional sites, formerly owned or operated by PPL
Electric, LG&E and KU predecessors or affiliates. LG&E and KU lack information on the conditions of such additional sites
and are therefore unable to estimate any potential liability they may have or a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related
to these matters. At December 31, 2015, PPL Electric has accrued $10 million representing its best estimate of the probable loss
incurred to remediate additional sites previously owned or operated by PPL Electric predecessors or affiliates. Depending on the
outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or been completed or developments at sites for which information
is incomplete, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be significant and may be as much as $29 million.

The EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result of the EPA's evaluation, individual states
may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup. This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive
assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot estimate
a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters.



From time to time, PPL's subsidiaries undertake remedial action
in response to notices of violations, spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA
and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary for compliance with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners
and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental
matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is
not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.

Future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under
review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in significant additional costs for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and
KU. Insurance policies maintained by LKE, LG&E and KU may be applicable to certain of the costs or other obligations related
to these matters but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured.

Environmental
Matters - WPD

(PPL)

WPD's distribution businesses are subject to environmental regulatory
and statutory requirements. PPL believes that WPD has taken and continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and
governmental regulations for the protection of the environment.

Other

Guarantees
and Other Assurances

(All Registrants)

In the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into
agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include,
for example, guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone
basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage.

(PPL)

PPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities
of PPL Capital Funding.

(All Registrants)

The table
below details guarantees provided as of December 31, 2015. "Exposure" represents the estimated maximum potential
amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. The probability of expected payment/performance
under each of these guarantees is remote except for "WPD guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities"
and "Indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures." The total recorded liability at December 31,
2015 was $25 million for PPL and $18 million for LKE. The total recorded liability at December 31, 2014 was $26 million for
PPL and $19 million for LKE. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, all guarantees of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and
KU also apply to PPL, and all guarantees of LG&E and KU also apply to LKE.

(a)

Indemnifications related to certain liabilities, including a specific
unresolved tax issue and those relating to properties and assets owned by the seller that were transferred to WPD Midlands in connection
with the acquisition. A cross indemnity has been received from the seller on the tax issue.

The
maximum exposure and expiration of these indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped
and the expiration date is not specified in the transaction documents.

(b)

Indemnification to the liquidators and certain others for existing liabilities
or expenses or liabilities arising during the liquidation process. The indemnifications are limited to distributions made from
the subsidiary to its parent either prior or subsequent to liquidation or are not explicitly stated in the agreements. The indemnifications
generally expire two to seven years subsequent to the date of dissolution of the entities. The exposure noted only includes those
cases where the agreements provide for specific limits.

In connection with their sales of various businesses,
WPD and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications
for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters or have agreed to continue their obligations under existing
third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make
reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees. Finally, WPD and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments
under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties.

(c)

Relates to certain obligations of discontinued or modified electric
associations that were guaranteed at the time of privatization by the participating members. Costs are allocated to the members
and can be reallocated if an existing member becomes insolvent. At December 31, 2015, WPD has recorded an estimated discounted
liability for which the expected payment/performance is probable. Neither the expiration date nor the maximum amount of potential
payments for certain obligations is explicitly stated in the related agreements, and as a result, the exposure has been estimated.

(d)

A third party logistics firm provides inventory procurement and fulfillment
services. The logistics firm has title to the inventory, however, upon termination of the contracts, PPL Electric has guaranteed
to purchase any remaining inventory that has not been used or sold.

(e)

LKE provides certain indemnifications covering the due and
                                                            punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective obligations. The most comprehensive of these
                                                            guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by
                                                            WKE under a 2009 Transaction Termination Agreement. This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a maximum
                                                            exposure of $200 million, exclusive of certain items such as government fines and penalties that fall outside the cap.
                                                            Another WKE-related LKE guarantee covers other indemnifications related to the purchase price of excess power, has a term
                                                            expiring in 2023, and a maximum exposure of $100 million. In May 2012, LKE's indemnitee received an unfavorable arbitration
                                                            panel's decision interpreting this matter. In October 2014, LKE's indemnitee filed a motion for discretionary review with
                                                            the                                                             Kentucky Supreme Court seeking to overturn the arbitration
                                                            decision, and such motion was denied by the court in September

                                                            filed a complaint in Henderson, Kentucky Circuit Court, seeking an award of damages in the matter. LKE
                                                            does                                                             not

                                                            the claims made                                                                               and has disputed the demands.
                                                            LKE                                                             believes its
                                                            indemnification obligations in the WKE matter                                                             remain subject to
                                                            various uncertainties, including additional legal and
                                                            contractual developments, as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power. The parties are
                                                            conducting preliminary settlement discussions, however, the ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related
                                                            indemnifications                                                             cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally,
                                                            LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations
                                                            for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates. The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from
                                                            being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the
                                                            event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party. LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of
                                                            the                                                             indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect
                                                            such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts
                                                            recorded.

(f)

Pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LG&E and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC's excess debt service,
post-retirement and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts currently included within a demand charge designed
and currently expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract. LKE's proportionate share of OVEC's outstanding debt
was $124 million at December 31, 2015, consisting of LG&E's share of $86 million and KU's share of $38 million.

The
maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. See "Energy Purchase
Commitments" above for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract.

The Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through
contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties
related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the
overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments
have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.

PPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains
insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate
coverage of $225 million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements.

Related Party Transactions

PLR
Contracts/Purchase of Accounts Receivable

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric holds competitive solicitations for PLR generation
supply. PPL EnergyPlus was awarded a portion of the PLR generation supply through these competitive solicitations. The purchases
from PPL EnergyPlus are included in PPL Electric's Statements of Income as "Energy purchases from affiliate" through
May 31, 2015, the period through which PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus were affiliated entities. As a result of the June 1,
2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and creation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an
affiliate of PPL Electric. PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are included as
purchases from an unaffiliated third party.



Under the standard Default Service Supply Master Agreement for
the solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined credit limits.
Wholesale suppliers are required to post collateral with PPL Electric when: (a) the market price of electricity to be
delivered by the wholesale suppliers exceeds the contract price for the forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered; and
(b) this market price exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit. In no instance is PPL Electric required to post collateral to
suppliers under these supply contracts.

PPL Electric's customers may choose an alternative supplier
for their generation supply. See Note 1 for additional information regarding PPL Electric's purchases of accounts receivable from
alternative suppliers, including Talen Energy Marketing. See Note 8 for additional information regarding the spinoff of PPL Energy
Supply.

Wholesale
Sales and Purchases

(LG&E and KU)

LG&E
and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When LG&E
has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases
electricity from LG&E. When KU has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost
is lower than that of LG&E, LG&E purchases electricity from KU. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income
as "Electric revenue from affiliate" and "Energy purchases from affiliate" and are recorded at a price equal
to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between
both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its
available generation.

Support
Costs

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

PPL Services and LKS provide PPL and LKE subsidiaries
with administrative, management and support services.  In 2015, PPL EU Services was formed to provide the majority
of financial, supply chain, human resources and facilities management services primarily to PPL Electric.  PPL
Services will continue to provide certain corporate functions. For all service companies, the costs of these services are
charged to the recipients as direct support costs.  General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific
entity are allocated and charged to the recipients as indirect support costs.  PPL Services and PPL EU Services use a
three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and
number of employees to allocate indirect costs.  LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of
employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information.

PPL
Services, PPL EU Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December 31, including
amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on
methods that are believed to be reasonable.

In
addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG&E and KU for fuel purchases and other
costs for products or services provided by third parties. LG&E and KU also provide services to each other and to LKS. Billings
between LG&E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other
company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between LKE and LG&E
and KU are reimbursed through LKS.

Intercompany
Borrowings

(LKE)

LKE maintains a $225 million revolving line of credit with a
PPL Energy Funding subsidiary whereby LKE can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. The interest rates on borrowings
are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $


million and $


million, respectively, was outstanding and reflected in "Notes
payable with affiliates" on the Balance Sheet.

The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing
at December 31, 2015 was 1.74% and 1.65% at December 31, 2014.

Interest expense on the revolving line of credit
was not significant for 2015, 2014 or 2013.

LKE maintains an agreement with a PPL affiliate that has a $300
million borrowing limit whereby LKE can loan funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. No balance was outstanding at December 31,
2015 and 2014. The interest rate on the



loan based on the PPL affiliate's credit rating is currently equal to one-month LIBOR plus
a spread. Interest income on this note was not significant for 2015, 2014 or 2013.

LKE entered into a $400 million ten-year-note with PPL Capital
Funding in November 2015. The proceeds were used to pay off an LKE senior unsecured note of the same amount maturing in November
2015. The interest rate on the note is equal to 3.5% with interest payments due in May and November. At December 31, 2015,
the note was reflected in "Long-term debt to affiliate" on the Balance Sheet. Interest expense on this note was not significant
for 2015.

Intercompany
Derivatives

(LKE, LG&E and KU)

Periodically, LG&E and KU enter into forward-starting interest
rate swaps with PPL. These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.
See Note 17 for additional information on intercompany derivatives.

Other

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

See Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing
agreement (for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU) and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense (for PPL Electric

Fair Value Measurements

(All Registrants)

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).
A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing
models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate.
These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management
believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate,
as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets
and liabilities is measured on a net basis.

Transfers between levels are
recognized at end-of-reporting-period values. During 2015 and 2014, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. See Note
1 for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy.

Price
Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate Swaps/Foreign Currency Contracts/Cross-Currency Swaps

(PPL, LKE,
LG&E and KU)

To manage interest rate risk, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU use
interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. To manage foreign
currency exchange risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics
of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts,
utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR and government security rates) and forward foreign
currency exchange rates (e.g., GBP), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain
cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These
models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation
adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3.

of the Supply segment's net assets as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.

discontinued operations at December 31, 2014. The fair values were estimated using an income approach by discounting future cash
flows at estimated current cost of funding rates, which incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants. Long-term debt is classified
as Level 2. The effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Risk Management Objectives

(All Registrants)

PPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors
to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances and foreign exchange (including price, liquidity
and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee,
comprised of senior management and chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities
designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval,
validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that
attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence
level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program.

Market Risk

Market risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred
as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric
risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management
strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, volumes of full-requirement
sales contracts, interest rates and foreign



currency exchange rates. Many of the contracts meet the definition
of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.

The following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and
its subsidiaries.

Interest
rate risk

ยท

PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate
debt issuances. PPL and WPD hold over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and
principal payments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. LG&E utilizes over-the-counter interest
rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LG&E and KU utilize forward starting interest
rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuances.

ยท

PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined
benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the
regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place.

Foreign currency risk

ยท

PPL is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates.

Commodity price risk

ยท

PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below. WPD is exposed to volumetric risk
which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K.

ยท

PPL Electric is exposed to commodity price risk from its obligation as PLR; however, its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism
substantially eliminates its exposure to this risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into
full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers. These supply agreements transfer the volumetric risk associated
with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers.

ยท

LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel and fuel-related expenses. In addition, LG&E's rates include
certain mechanisms for natural gas supply. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price and volumetric
fluctuations associated with these expenses.

Equity securities price risk

ยท

PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly
mitigated at the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place.

ยท

PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to
a counterparty's non-performance.

PPL is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money"
interest rate and foreign currency derivatives with financial institutions, as well as additional credit risk through certain of
its subsidiaries, as discussed below.

In the event a supplier of LKE (through its subsidiaries LG&E
and KU) or PPL Electric defaults on its obligation, those entities would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel
in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities
would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thus mitigating the financial risk for these entities.



PPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage
credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use
of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment
or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the
event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages
or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.

Master Netting Arrangements

Net derivative
positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to
return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU had no obligation to return cash collateral
under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

PPL, LKE and LG&E posted $9 million and $21 million of cash
collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

KU did not post any cash collateral under master netting arrangements
at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

See "Offsetting Derivative Instruments" below for
a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements.

Interest
Rate Risk

(All Registrants)

PPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations,
which exposes them to interest rate risk. Various financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and
floating interest rates in their debt portfolio, adjust the duration of the debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates
in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance
risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark
interest rates.

Cash Flow Hedges

(PPL)

Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate
movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that
qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated
debt issuances. At December 31, 2015, PPL held an aggregate notional value in interest rate swap contracts of $300 million
that range in maturity through 2026.

At December 31, 2015,
PPL held an aggregate notional value in cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of $

1.3

billion that range in maturity from 2016 through 2028 to hedge the interest payments and principal of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated
senior notes.

For 2015,
2014 and 2013, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives was insignificant.

Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable
that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously
recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring.

As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply,
all PPL cash flow hedges associated with PPL Energy Supply were ineffective and discontinued and therefore, reclassified into earnings
during the second quarter of 2015 and reflected in discontinued operations for 2015. See Note 8 for additional information.

For PPL's
remaining cash flow hedges, PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges
in 2015 and 2013 and an insignificant amount reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges in 2014.



At December 31,
2015, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives that are expected to be reclassified
into earnings during the next 12 months were insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded.

(LKE,
LG&E and KU)

Periodically, LG&E and KU enter into forward-starting interest
rate swaps with PPL that have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties. It is probable
that realized gains and losses on all of these swaps will be recoverable through regulated rates; as such, any gains and losses
on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and will be recognized in "Interest Expense" on
the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. In
September 2015, first mortgage bonds totaling $1.05 billion were issued (LG&E issued $550 million and KU issued $500 million)
and all outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps were terminated. Net cash settlements of $88 million were paid on the
swaps that were terminated (LG&E and KU each paid $44 million). The settlements are included in "Regulatory assets"
(noncurrent) on the Balance Sheets and "Cash Flows from Operating Activities" on the Statements of Cash Flows.

Economic
Activity

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

LG&E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically
hedge interest payments on variable rate debt. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including a terminated swap contract,
are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets
or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in "Interest Expense"
on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2015, LG&E
held contracts with a notional amount of $179 million that range in maturity through 2033.

Foreign
Currency Risk

(PPL)

PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments
in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign
currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.
In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected GBP earnings.

Net Investment Hedges

PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary
to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD. The contracts outstanding at December 31, 2015 had a notional
amount of ยฃ50 million (approximately $84 million based on contracted rates). The settlement dates of these contracts range
from May 2016 through June 2016.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, PPL had $19 million and
$14 million of accumulated net investment hedge after tax gains (losses) that were included in the foreign currency translation
adjustment component of AOCI.

Economic Activity

PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary
to economically hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings. At December 31, 2015, the total exposure hedged by PPL was approximately
ยฃ1.8 billion (approximately $2.9 billion based on contracted rates). These contracts had termination dates ranging from January
2016 through December 2017.

Accounting
and Reporting

(All Registrants)

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the
Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts for PPL and PPL Electric include certain full-requirement
purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair
values of LG&E's and KU's



interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets
or regulatory liabilities. See Note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31,
2015 and 2014.

See Note 1 for additional information on accounting policies
related to derivative instruments.

Offsetting
Derivative Instruments

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries have
master netting arrangements in place and also enter into agreements pursuant to which they purchase or sell certain energy and
other products. Under the agreements, upon termination of the agreement as a result of a default or other termination event, the
non-defaulting party typically would have a right to set off amounts owed under the agreement against any other obligations arising
between the two parties (whether under the agreement or not), whether matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place
of payment or place of booking of the obligation.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU have elected not to offset derivative
assets and liabilities and not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral pledged (an asset)
or the obligation to return cash collateral received (a liability) under derivatives agreements.

The

and related cash collateral received or pledged.

Credit
Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent
features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral
upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries. Most of these features would
require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating
were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral
upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating
were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit
contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full
collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.

Additionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related
contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding
the performance of PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance
could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy
entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate
payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with "adequate
assurance" features.

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

At

(a)

Gross carrying amount represents the fair value at the acquisition date of coal contracts with terms favorable to market recognized
as a result of the 2010 acquisition by PPL. An offsetting regulatory liability was recorded related to these contracts, which is
being amortized over the same period as the intangible assets, eliminating any income statement impact. See Note 6 for additional
information.

(b)

Emission allowances/RECs are expensed when consumed or sold; therefore, there is no accumulated amortization.

(c)

Gross carrying amount represents the fair value at the acquisition date of the OVEC power purchase contract recognized as a
result of the 2010 acquisition by PPL. An offsetting regulatory liability was recorded related to this contract, which is being
amortized over the same period as the intangible asset, eliminating any income statement impact. See Note 6 for additional information.

Current intangible assets are included in "Other current
assets" on the Balance Sheets. Long-term intangible assets are presented as "Other intangibles" on the Balance Sheets.

Asset Retirement Obligations

(PPL)

WPD has recorded conditional AROs required by U.K. law related
to treated wood poles, gas-filled switchgear and fluid-filled cables.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for
the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These
assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this
option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E's and KU's AROs are primarily related to the final
retirement of assets associated with generating units. LG&E also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&E's
and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements which do not generally
require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets.
As described in Notes 1 and 6, LG&E's and KU's accretion and depreciation expense are recorded as a regulatory asset, such
that there is no earnings impact.

The
changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows.

LKE recorded
increases of $228 million ($139 million at KU and $89 million at LG&E) to the existing AROs during 2015 as a result of an engineering
study that was performed, in connection with the final CCR rule, providing clarity on projected CCR closure costs and revisions
in the timing and amounts of future expected cash flows. Further increases to AROs or



changes to current capital plans or to operating costs may be
required as estimates of future cash flows are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results and regulatory
or legal proceedings. In 2014, AROs were revalued primarily due to updates in the estimated cash flows for ash ponds based on updated
cost estimates.

As of December 31, 2015, LKE had $50 million ($25 million at
LG&E and KU) of the ARO balances classified as current liabilities. These current liabilities are primarily related to CCR
closure costs expected to be incurred in 2016. As of December 31, 2014, substantially all of the ARO balances are classified as
noncurrent liabilities.

See Note 13 for information on the final CCR rule and Note 6
for information on the rate recovery applications with the KPSC.

New Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption

(All Registrants)

Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued accounting guidance that establishes a comprehensive new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
This model is based on the core principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services.

For public business entities, this guidance can be applied using
either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, beginning in annual reporting periods after December 15,
2017 and interim periods within those years. Public business entities may early adopt this guidance in annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Registrants expect to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018.

The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of adopting
this guidance, as well as the transition method they will use.

SCHEDULE
I - PPL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of Presentation

PPL Corporation is a holding company and conducts substantially
all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. Substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries.
Accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of these subsidiaries
and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends, loans or advances or repayment of loans
and advances from it. These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Reg. ยง210.12-04
of Regulation S-X. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
of PPL Corporation.

PPL Corporation indirectly or directly owns all of the ownership
interests of its significant subsidiaries. PPL Corporation relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL Corporation's
dividends to its common shareowners and to meet its other cash requirements. See Note 7 to PPL Corporation's consolidated financial
statements for discussions related to restricted net assets of its subsidiaries for the purposes of transferring funds to PPL in
the form of distributions, loans or advances.

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

Effective October 1, 2015, PPL Corporation retrospectively adopted
accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

The adoption of this guidance required PPL Corporation to reclassify
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities from current to noncurrent on the balance sheet, and did not have a significant
impact.  PPL Corporation reclassified $34 million from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets and $5
million from current deferred tax liabilities to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.

2.

Commitments and Contingencies

See Note 13 to PPL Corporation's consolidated financial statements
for commitments and contingencies of its subsidiaries.

Guarantees and Other Assurances

PPL Corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal
entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts that may become due under PPL Corporation's guarantees or other assurances or
to make any funds available for such payment.

PPL Corporation fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment
of principal, premium and interest on all of the debt securities of PPL Capital Funding. The estimated maximum potential amount
of future payments that could be required under the guarantees at December 31, 2015 was $8.4 billion. These guarantees will expire
in 2073. The probability of expected payment under these guarantees is remote.









Schedule
I - LG&E and KU Energy LLC

Notes to Condensed Unconsolidated Financial Statements

1.

Basis of Presentation

LG&E and KU Energy LLC (LKE) is a holding company and conducts
substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. Substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by
such subsidiaries. Accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of
these subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends or repayment of loans
and advances from the subsidiaries. These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance
with Reg. ยง210.12-04 of Regulation S-X. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto of LKE.

LKE indirectly or directly owns all of the ownership interests
of its significant subsidiaries. LKE relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund LKE's dividends to its member
and to meet its other cash requirements. See Note 7 to LKE's consolidated financial statements for discussions related to restricted
net assets of its subsidiaries for the purposes of transferring funds to LKE in the form of distributions, loans or advances.

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

Effective October 1, 2015, LKE retrospectively adopted accounting
guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities be
classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

The adoption of this guidance required LKE to reclassify deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities from current to noncurrent on the balance sheet, and did not have a significant impact.
LKE reclassified $2 million from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of December
31, 2014.

Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

Effective December 31, 2015, LKE retrospectively adopted accounting
guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires certain debt issuance costs to be presented
on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability.

The adoption of this guidance required LKE to reclassify debt
issuance costs not associated with a line of credit from noncurrent assets to Long-term debt, and did not have a significant impact
on the Registrants. LKE reclassified $4 million from Other noncurrent assets to Long-term debt on the balance sheet as of December
31, 2014.

2.

Commitments and Contingencies

See Note 13 to LKE's consolidated financial statements for commitments
and contingencies of its subsidiaries.

Guarantees

LKE provides certain indemnifications, the most significant
of which relate to the termination of the WKE lease in July 2009. These guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance
and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations. The most comprehensive of these WKE-related guarantees
is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the
WKE Transaction Termination Agreement. This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure
of $200 million. Certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap. Another WKE-related LKE
guarantee covers other indemnifications, has a term expiring in 2023 and a maximum exposure of $100 million. In May 2012, LKE's
indemnitee received an unfavorable arbitration panel's decision interpreting this matter. In October 2014, LKE's indemnitee filed
a motion for discretionary review with the Kentucky Supreme Court seeking to overturn the arbitration decision, and such motion
was denied by the court in September 2015. In September 2015, a counterparty issued a demand letter to LKE's indemnitee. LKE does
not believe appropriate contractual, legal or commercial grounds exist for the claim made and anticipates the indemnitee to dispute
the demand. LKE believes its indemnification obligations in the WKE matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including additional
legal and contractual developments, as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power. The ultimate
outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time.



Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related
to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates. The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures
range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in
the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party. LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the
indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded.

3.

Long-term Debt

See Note 7 to LKE's consolidated financial statements for the
terms of LKE's outstanding senior unsecured notes outstanding. Of the total outstanding, $475 million matures in 2020 and $250
million matures in 2021. These maturities are based on stated maturities. Also see Note 7 to LKE's consolidated financial statements
for the terms of LKE's $400 million note payable to PPL. This note matures in 2025. LKE's $100 million note payable to LG&E
and KU Services Company bears a variable interest rate which resets each quarter based on LIBOR. The rate at December 31, 2015
was 1.068%. This note matures in 2019.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN
AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

PPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, LG&E

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

PPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, LG&E and KU Energy LLC, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company

The Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers, based on their evaluation of the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) have concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to the Registrants and their consolidated subsidiaries is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, particularly during the period for which this annual report has been prepared.  The aforementioned principal officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

PPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, LG&E and KU Energy LLC, Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and Kentucky Utilities Company

The Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that there were no changes in the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting during the Registrants' fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting.

PPL Corporation

Following the announcement of the transaction to spin off PPL
        Energy Supply, LLC to form Talen Energy, management determined the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries.
        During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, staffing changes, including the consolidation of certain positions and transition
        of responsibilities, resulted in changes in certain individuals responsible for executing internal controls. However, changes to
        system applications, business processes and the associated internal controls were not significant. Management has taken steps to
        minimize the risk from the changes in individuals executing internal controls.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

PPL Corporation



PPL's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
        adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). PPL's
        internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's management and Board of
        Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
        reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
        including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
        internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013)
        issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
        "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
        was effective as of December 31, 2015. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited
        by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report contained on page 88.

PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, LG&E and KU Energy LLC, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company

Management of PPL's non-accelerated filer companies, PPL Electric,
        LKE, LG&E and KU, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
        term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Each of the aforementioned companies' internal control over financial
        reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and Board of Directors of these companies regarding
        the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
        accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
        or detect misstatements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
        including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of the companies listed above, we conducted an evaluation
        of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in "Internal Control - Integrated
        Framework" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
        under the framework in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013), management of these companies concluded that
        our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. This annual report does not include an
        attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the companies' independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
        over financial reporting for these non-accelerated filer companies. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
        for the aforementioned companies was not subject to attestation by the companies' registered public accounting firm pursuant to
        rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit these companies to provide only management's report in this annual
        report.

As previously disclosed, on December 18, 2015, the Board of

Pursuant to new Article III, Section 3.18 of the Bylaws, a shareowner, or a group of up to 25 shareowners, owning 3% or more of
PPL's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, may nominate, and include in PPL's proxy materials, directors
constituting up to the greater of (i) 20% of the Board or (ii) two directors, provided that the shareowner(s) and the nominee(s)
satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws.  In connection with PPL's adoption of proxy access and in order to ensure
full disclosure in regard to a nominating shareowner's ownership position in PPL, Article III, Section 3.16 of the Bylaws was also
amended to expand the disclosure requirements for the nomination of directors under PPL's advance notice provision, including disclosure
of securities ownership, derivative and short positions, certain interests that the nominating shareowner or director nominee might
have in the nomination and such other information as PPL may reasonably request.



PPL has adopted a code of ethics entitled "Standards of

financial officers and principal accounting officers (each, a "principal officer")), employees and agents of PPL and
PPL's subsidiaries for which it has operating control (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU). The "Standards of Integrity"

. A description of any amendment to the "Standards
of Integrity" (other than a technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendment) will be posted on PPL's Internet
website within four business days following the date of the amendment. In addition, if a waiver constituting a material departure
from a provision of the "Standards of Integrity" is granted to one of the principal officers, a description of the nature
of the waiver, the name of the person to whom the waiver was granted and the date of the waiver will be posted on PPL's Internet
website within four business days following the date of the waiver.

Approval of Fees

The Audit Committee of PPL has
procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor. These procedures are designed
to ensure the continued independence of the independent auditor. More specifically, the use of the independent auditor to perform
either audit or non-audit services is prohibited unless specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee of PPL. As a result
of this approval process, the Audit Committee of PPL has pre-approved specific categories of services and authorization levels.
All services outside of the specified categories and all amounts exceeding the authorization levels are approved by the Chair of
the Audit Committee of PPL, who serves as the Committee designee to review and approve audit and non-audit related services during
the year. A listing of the approved audit and non-audit services is reviewed with the full Audit Committee of PPL no later than
its next meeting.

The Audit Committee of PPL approved 100% of the 2015 and 2014
services provided by EY.
