Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of
Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber  Company.  It is
principally engaged in the growing and harvesting of timber and the
manufacture, distribution and sale of forest products, real estate
development and construction, and other real estate related activities.
Its business segments are timberlands; wood products; pulp, paper and
packaging; and real estate and related assets.

Information with respect to the description and general development of the
company's business, included on pages 38 through 42, Description of the
Business of the Company, contained in the company's 1998 Annual Report to
Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial information with respect to industry segments and geographical
areas, included in Notes 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements
contained in the company's 1998 Annual Report to Shareholders, is
incorporated herein by reference.

Timberlands

The company is engaged in the management of 5.1 million acres of company-
owned and .2 million acres of leased commercial forestland  in the United
States (3.3 million acres in the South and 2 million acres in the Pacific
Northwest), most of it highly productive and located extremely well to
serve both domestic and international markets.  The standing timber
inventory on these lands is approximately 94 million cunits (a cunit is 100
cubic feet of solid wood).  The relationship between cubic measurement and
the quantity of end products that may be produced from timber varies
according to the species, size and quality of timber, and will change
through time as the mix of these variables changes.  To sustain the timber
supply from its fee timberlands, the company is engaged in extensive
planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and
commercial thinning, fertilization and operational pruning, all of which
increase the yield from its fee timberland acreage.






Selected product prices:




Wood Products

The company's wood products businesses produce and sell softwood lumber,
plywood and veneer; oriented strand board, composite and other panels;

materials are sold to wholesalers, retailers and industrial users.  The raw
materials required to produce these products are purchased from third
parties, transferred at market price from the company's timberlands, or
obtained from long-term licensing arrangements covering approximately 27
million acres in Canada (of which 18.9 million acres are considered to be
productive forestland).

Sales volumes by major product are as follows (millions):

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

The company conducted a review of its 10 major pulp and paper facilities to
evaluate the facilities' compliance with federal Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) regulations.  The results of the reviews were disclosed
to seven state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
during 1994 and 1995.  All PSD compliance issues identified in the review
have been resolved, except for PSD issues at the company's Springfield,
Oregon containerboard facility.  A final decision is expected to be made by
the Lane County Oregon Regional Air Pollution Control Authority concerning
alleged PSD and permit violations at the company's Springfield, Oregon,
containerboard manufacturing facility upon issuance of the facility's Title
V permit in 1999.

In June 1998, a lawsuit was filed against the company in Superior Court,
San Francisco County, California, on behalf of a purported class of
individuals and entities that own property in the United States on which
exterior hardboard siding manufactured by the company has been installed
since 1981.  The action alleges the company manufactured and distributed
defective hardboard siding, breached express warranties and consumer
protection statutes and failed to disclose to consumers the alleged
defective nature of its hardboard siding.  The action seeks compensatory
and punitive damages, costs and reasonable attorney fees.  In December
1998, the complaint was amended narrowing the purported class to
individuals and entities in the state of California.  On February 4, 1999,
the court entered an order certifying the class.  The company intends to
seek a review of that order.  In September 1998, a lawsuit purporting to be
a class action involving hardboard siding was filed against the company in
Superior Court, King County, Washington.  The complaint was amended, in
January 1999, to allege a class consisting of individuals and entities that
own homes or other structures in the United States on which exterior
hardboard siding manufactured by the company at its former Klamath Falls,
Oregon facility has been installed since January 1981.  The amended
complaint alleges the company manufactured defective hardboard siding,
engaged in unfair trade practices and failed to disclose to customers the
alleged defective nature of its hardboard siding.  The amended complaint
seeks compensatory damages, punitive or treble damages, restitution,
attorney fees, costs of the suit and such other relief as may be
appropriate.  The company is a defendant in approximately twenty-four other
hardboard siding cases, one of which purports to be a state-wide class
action on behalf of purchasers of single or multi-family residences in Iowa
that contain the company's hardboard siding.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the clean-up
of hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as "Superfund," and similar
state laws.  The EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the
company that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to
other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted
against the company.  The company is also a party to other legal
proceedings and environmental matters generally incidental to its business.
Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding or environmental matter
is subject to a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any
degree of certainty, the company presently believes that any ultimate
outcome resulting from these proceedings and matters, or all of them
combined, would not have a material effect on the company's current
financial position, liquidity or results of operations; however, in any
given future reporting period, such proceedings or matters could have a
material effect on results of operations.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- ------------------------------------------------------------

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 27, 1998.
