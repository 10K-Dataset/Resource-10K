DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. It is principally engaged in the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture, distribution and sale of
forest products; and real estate development and construction. Its business segments are:

Ÿ

Timberlands, which includes logs, chips and timber.

Ÿ

Wood Products, which includes softwood lumber, plywood, veneer, composite panels, oriented strand board (OSB), hardwood lumber, engineered lumber, raw materials and building
materials distribution.

Ÿ

Cellulose Fiber and White Papers, which includes pulp, paper and liquid packaging board.

Ÿ

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling.

Ÿ

Real Estate and Related Assets.

Ÿ

Corporate and Other.

Throughout this document, the term “company” refers to Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and variable interest entities of which Weyerhaeuser Company or its
subsidiaries are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The term “Weyerhaeuser” refers to the forest products-based operations and excludes the Real Estate and Related Assets operations.

The company has approximately 49,900 employees, of whom 48,300 are employed by Weyerhaeuser,
and of this number, approximately 21,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which generally are negotiated on a multi-year basis. Approximately 1,600 of the company’s employees are involved in the activities of its Real Estate and
Related Assets segment.

The major markets, both domestic and foreign, in
which Weyerhaeuser sells its products are highly competitive, with numerous strong sellers competing in each. Many of Weyerhaeuser’s products also compete with substitutes for wood and wood fiber products. The company’s subsidiaries in the
Real Estate and Related Assets segment operate in highly competitive markets, competing with numerous regional and national firms in real estate development and construction and other real estate related activities. The company competes in its
markets primarily through price, product quality and service levels.

In
recent years, the company has grown substantially through acquisitions with the purchases of MacMillan Bloedel in 1999, Trus Joist International (Trus Joist) in 2000, and Willamette Industries, Inc. (Willamette) in 2002.

In 2005, the company’s sales from continuing operations to customers outside the United
States totaled $3.7 billion (including exports of $1.8 billion from the United States, $1.2 billion of Canadian export and domestic sales and $0.7 billion of other foreign sales), or 16 percent of total consolidated sales and revenues, compared with
17 percent in 2004. All sales to customers outside the United States are subject to risks related to international trade and to political, economic and other factors that vary from country to country.

Financial information with respect to industry segments and geographical areas is included
in Notes 25 and 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

company’s internet site is www.weyerhaeuser.com.



RISK FACTORS

Investing in the
company’s securities involves risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces.

Strategic Review

The company has been undertaking a strategic review of its
asset portfolio. Facilities that do not represent a long-term strategic fit for the company, or that cannot achieve top-quartile performance without significant capital investments, are being assessed for closure or sale. The company’s
strategic review has resulted in the sale and closure of several company facilities during 2005 and may result in additional dispositions or closures of company assets in 2006. The impact of these changes in the company’s asset portfolio may
result in changes to future company operations that may affect the market price of the company’s securities.

Reduction in Credit Rating on Company Debt Securities

The actions taken by the
company as a result of its ongoing strategic review of its asset portfolio may affect the credit rating on the company’s debt securities. Credit rating agencies may from time to time change their ratings on the company’s securities as a
result of the company’s operating results or actions the company takes or as a result of a change in the views of the credit rating agencies regarding, among other things, the general outlook for the company’s industry or the economy.
There can be no assurance that Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s or other rating agencies will not reduce their ratings of the company’s securities or securities that the company may issue in the future or place any of those
securities on a so-called “watch list” for possible future downgrading. Any of these events would likely increase the company’s costs of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of the company’s securities. The
credit ratings accorded to the company’s securities are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell those securities, inasmuch as those ratings do not comment as to the market price or suitability for particular investors.

Share Repurchase

On October 21, 2005, the company announced a program to repurchase 18 million shares of its outstanding common stock. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.” The company’s repurchase of its common stock may affect the future market price of the company’s securities.

Adverse Effects on Company Operating Results

Historically, the company’s operating results have been affected by a variety of market conditions that influence demand and pricing for the company’s products. Certain factors, such as the health of the economy, the level of
interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar, are cyclical in nature. Other factors, such as a trend toward electronic substitution for paper, may represent fundamental changes in the marketplace for the company’s products. In addition,
the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by increases in raw material, chemicals, energy and transportation costs. See “Economic and Industry Factors Affecting Operations” and “Critical Accounting Policies —
Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Adverse Decision in Paragon Trade Brands Bankruptcy Proceedings

In 1999, the
Equity Committee (Committee) in the Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. (Paragon), bankruptcy proceeding commenced an adversary proceeding against the company in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia asserting the company breached
certain warranties in agreements between Paragon and the company connected with Paragon’s public offering of common stock in February 1993. The Committee sought to recover damages sustained by Paragon in two patent infringement cases, one
brought by Procter & Gamble and the other by Kimberly-Clark. In June 2002, the Bankruptcy Court held the company liable for breaches of warranty. In the second quarter of 2005, the Bankruptcy Court imposed damages of approximately $470
million. The company appealed the liability and damages determinations to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and posted a bond of $500 million. The company has not established a reserve for this matter because, based upon
the information currently available to the company, including management’s belief that an adverse result is not probable because the company will prevail on appeal, management believes the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(Statement 5), for establishing a reserve in this matter have not been met. However, there is no guarantee that management will not determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion



of any damage award is required. Any such charge could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations for the quarter or the year
in which such a charge may be recognized.

Adverse Verdict in Alder Log Antitrust
Cases

In December 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the company in U.S. District Court in Oregon (the Initial Alder Case) alleging that from 1996 to
the present, the company had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the Pacific Northwest market for alder logs and finished alder lumber. A jury verdict of trebled damages of $79 million was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit where the decision was upheld. In September 2005, the company asked for discretionary review of the Initial Alder Case by the U.S. Supreme Court. In November 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court asked the Solicitor General to express the
opinions of the United States on whether to accept review.

In January 2005,
the company received a copy of a “complaint in equity” filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon to set aside the judgment in the Initial Alder Case on behalf of a plaintiff who did not prevail in the trial. It alleged a fraud was committed
on the court and requested judgment against the plaintiff be vacated and a new trial set on plaintiff’s claim of monopolization of the alder sawlog market. Trebled damages of $20 million are alleged. The U.S. District Court stayed this matter
until the U.S. Supreme Court takes final action in the Initial Alder Case. The company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter.

In June 2003, Washington Alder filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in U.S. District Court in Oregon alleging monopolization of
the alder log and lumber markets and seeking trebled damages of $36 million and divestiture of the company’s Northwest Hardwoods Division and alder sawmills in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. A jury verdict of trebled damages of
$16 million was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. After oral argument in November 2005, the matter was stayed pending a final disposition by the U.S. Supreme Court of the Initial Alder Case.

In 2004, the company settled similar lawsuits filed against the company by five hardwood
mill owners in the U.S. District Court in Oregon.

In April 2004, a civil
class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company in U.S. District Court in Oregon claiming that as a result of the company’s alleged monopolization of the alder sawlog market in the Pacific Northwest as determined in the Initial
Alder Case, the company monopolized the market for finished alder and charged monopoly prices for finished alder lumber. In December 2004, the Judge issued an order certifying the plaintiff as a class representative for all U.S. purchasers of
finished alder lumber between April 28, 2000, and March 31, 2004, for purposes of awarding monetary damages. The company disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and intends to continue vigorously defending the case. In February 2005,
class counsel notified the court that approximately 5 percent of the class members opted out of the class action lawsuit. The company has no litigation pending with any entity that has opted out of the class, but it is possible that entities that
have opted out may file lawsuits against the company in the future. The case was stayed in the fourth quarter of 2005 pending the U.S. Supreme Court entering a final opinion in the Initial Alder Case.

As of December 25, 2005, the company has a reserve of $95 million related to the alder
cases. While the company believes the reserve established for the alder antitrust litigation is adequate, the company is unable to estimate what additional charges, if any, may be required in the future because of the uncertainties surrounding the
litigation process.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

There are no
unresolved comments that were received from the SEC staff relating to the company’s periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

TIMBERLANDS

Weyerhaeuser is engaged in the management of 5.7 million acres of company-owned and 0.7 million acres of
leased commercial forestland in North America (4.2 million acres in the southern United States and 2.2 million acres in the Pacific Northwest and Canada), most of it highly productive and located extremely well to serve both domestic and
international markets. Weyerhaeuser also has renewable, long-term licenses on 27.6 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada. The aggregate standing timber inventory on Weyerhaeuser’s North American lands is
approximately



335 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood). The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of end products that may be
produced from timber varies according to the species, size and quality of timber, and will change through time as the mix of these variables changes. The end products are generally measured in board feet for lumber and square feet for panel
products. To sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, Weyerhaeuser is engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and commercial thinning, fertilization, and operational pruning, all of which
increase the yield from its fee timberland acreage.

Weyerhaeuser also manages
forestlands in the Southern Hemisphere. The results of these international operations are included in the Corporate and Other segment.

NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Growing and harvesting timber is subject to numerous laws and
government policies to protect the environment, nontimber resources such as wildlife and water, and other social values. Changes in those laws and policies can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of
timber-based raw materials.

In the United States, a number of fish and
wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within company timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws. Federal ESA listings include the northern spotted
owl, marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest and the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise and American burying beetle in the Southeast. Listings of additional species or populations
may result from pending or future citizen petitions or be initiated by federal or state agencies. Federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some
timberlands, including some timberlands of Weyerhaeuser. Additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered, threatened or sensitive under the ESA and similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to
protect habitat for these species may, in the future, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices, could increase operating costs, and could affect timber supply and prices.

In the United States, federal, state and local regulations protecting water quality and
wetlands also could affect future harvest and forest management practices on some of Weyerhaeuser’s timberlands. Forest practice acts in some states in the United States increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management
activities. For example, in some states, these acts limit the size of clearcuts, require some timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat, regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads, require
reforestation following timber harvest, and contain procedures for state agencies to review and approve proposed forest practice activities. Some states and some local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs.
Each state in which Weyerhaeuser owns timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and
local governments to achieve water-quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act, protect fish and wildlife habitats, or achieve other public policy objectives.

Weyerhaeuser operates under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative

®

, a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to
further protect certain public resources and values. The Sustainable Forestry Initiative

®

is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations, academia, the forest industry, and large and small forest landowners. Compliance with the Sustainable
Forestry Initiative

®

may result in some increases
in operating costs and curtailment of timber harvests in some areas.

The
regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased operating costs, resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from the company’s timberlands, and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood
products and wood chips during periods of high demand. These kinds of programs can also make it more difficult to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances. One additional effect may be further reductions
in usage of, and some substitution of other products for, lumber and plywood. Weyerhaeuser does not believe that these kinds of programs have had, or in 2006 will have, a significant effect on the company’s total harvest of timber in the United
States or any major U.S. region, although they may have such an effect in the future. Further, Weyerhaeuser does not expect to be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. Likewise,
management expects that these programs will not significantly disrupt Weyerhaeuser’s planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.

Weyerhaeuser’s forest operations in Canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses. All forest operations are subject to forest practices and
environmental regulations, and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between the company and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and other social values. In Canada, the federal Species at Risk Act
(SARA) was enacted in 2002. SARA enacted protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat. To date, SARA has not had a significant effect on Weyerhaeuser’s operations; however, it is anticipated that SARA
will over time result in some additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices and increase some operating costs for operators of forestlands in Canada. For these reasons, SARA is expected to affect timber supply and
prices in the future.



Weyerhaeuser participates in the Canadian
Standards Association Sustainable Forest Management System standard, a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values. Compliance with this standard will result in some increases in operating costs and
curtailment of timber harvests in some areas in Canada.

Many of the Canadian
forestlands also are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada. Most of B.C. is not covered by treaties and, as a result, the claims of B.C.’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest
resources are largely unresolved, although many aboriginal groups are actively engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C. and Canada. Final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups are expected to result in
additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in Canada. The company believes that such claims will not have a significant effect on Weyerhaeuser’s total harvest of
timber or production of forest products in 2006, although they may have such an effect in the future.

The company also is subject to federal, state and provincial, and local pollution controls with regard to air, water and land; solid and hazardous waste management, disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all
areas in which it has operations; as well as market demands with respect to chemical content of some products and use of recycled fiber. Compliance with these laws, regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional
operating costs. The company cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with these laws, regulations and demands, or the effects on operating costs, because in some instances, compliance standards have not been
developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, compliance with standards frequently serves other purposes such as extension of facility life, increase in capacity, changes in raw material requirements, or increase in economic value
of assets or products. While it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects, Weyerhaeuser estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance were approximately $31 million in 2005 (4
percent of total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and Real Estate and Related Assets). Based on its understanding of current regulatory requirements in the United States and Canada, Weyerhaeuser expects that capital expenditures for
environmental compliance will be approximately $42 million in 2006 (5 percent of expected total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and Real Estate and Related Assets).

Weyerhaeuser is involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites. Some of the sites are on property presently or
formerly owned by the company where the company has the sole obligation to remediate the site or shares that obligation with one or more parties; others are third-party sites involving several parties who have a joint and several obligation to
remediate the site; and some are superfund sites where the company has been named as a potentially responsible party. The company’s liability with respect to these sites ranges from insignificant at some sites to substantial at others,
depending on the quantity, toxicity and nature of materials deposited by the company at the site and, with respect to some sites, the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties.

The company spent approximately $14 million in 2005, and expects to spend approximately $14
million in 2006, on environmental remediation of these sites. It is the company’s policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is determined that it is probable that such an obligation exists and the amount of the obligation can
be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals of $29 million by amounts that may prove insignificant
or that could range, in the aggregate, up to approximately $70 million over several years. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently
based and uses assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has promulgated regulations dealing with air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities, including regulations on hazardous air pollutants that
require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze. The U.S. EPA has also adopted MACT standards for air emissions from wood products facilities and industrial boilers. The
company anticipates that it might spend as much as $30 million over the next few years to comply with the MACT standards. The company cannot quantify future capital requirements needed to comply with new regulations being developed by the U.S. EPA
or Canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated. However, at this time the company anticipates that compliance with the new regulations will not result in capital expenditures in any year that are material in
relation to the company’s annual capital expenditures.



The American Forest & Paper
Association has made a commitment on behalf of all association members of the association to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2012. The company also is actively participating in negotiations between the Forest Products Association of
Canada and Natural Resources Canada to define industry obligations for complying with Canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next several years. The company cannot estimate what expenditures may ultimately be
required to contribute to these commitments but does not expect significant expenditures in 2006. During 2005, the company continued its work with international, national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and
economically viable policies, practices and procedures for measuring, reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S. EPA has repealed the regulations promulgated in 2000 that would have required states to develop total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocations for pollutants in
water bodies determined to be water-quality-impaired. However, states continue to promulgate TMDL requirements. The state TMDL requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional requirements, such
as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants. It is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for the company to meet pollution allocations
across the various proposed state TMDL programs until a specific TMDL is promulgated.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ECONOMIC AND
INDUSTRY FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATIONS

Historically, the
company’s operating results have been affected by a variety of market conditions that influence demand and pricing for the company’s products. Certain factors, such as the health of the economy and the strength of the U.S. dollar, are
cyclical in nature. The global economy, which affects the demand for a number of the company’s products, continued to grow at a healthy pace in 2005. Despite a large and growing trade deficit, the U.S. dollar appreciated through much of the
year. A stronger U.S. dollar makes it more difficult for U.S. manufactured goods to compete with international suppliers. Other factors, such as the surge in containerboard capacity in Asia and a trend toward electronic substitution for paper, may
represent fundamental changes in the marketplace for the company’s products. Finally, higher energy prices and increased transportation costs, due in part to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, resulted in lower profit margins for many of the
company’s operations in 2005.

Market pulp demand growth slowed in 2005,
consistent with little growth in printing and writing paper production in North America, Europe and Japan. Industry pulp prices were relatively flat compared to 2004. Approximately 35 percent of the company’s pulp production is based in
Canada. As a result, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affected the competitiveness of these mills.

Uncoated free sheet (UCFS) demand in North America fell approximately 4 percent in 2005. UCFS use continues to be negatively affected by the substitution of electronic
technologies and competition from other paper grades in commercial printing. On average, industry UCFS prices were up in 2005 versus 2004, but margins were eroded by higher production costs, especially energy. The challenging situation led several
North American companies, including Weyerhaeuser, to announce plant closures in 2005.

Industry box shipments increased slightly in 2005. Growth in industrial production of non-durable goods, the primary factor affecting demand for boxes, slowed in 2005 due to the stronger U.S. dollar, which eroded the competitive position of
U.S. manufacturing. Because the industry’s containerboard capacity has been decreasing for several years, the industry’s operating rate remained near 95 percent. Thus, despite slow growth in demand, average industry prices for 2005 were
near 2004 levels.

Housing sales and starts increased in 2005 due to an
economic and interest rate environment that continued to be favorable. The company’s real estate business operates in some of the stronger housing markets in the United States, such as Southern California, Las Vegas and the Washington D.C.
area. Both the number of single-family home sales closed and the average selling price realized by the company’s real estate business increased in 2005.

As a result of the strong housing market and remodeling activity, North American demand for lumber and structural panel products remained very high in 2005. The growth
in manufacturing capacity, especially for lumber, coupled with improvements in rail transportation resulted in downward pressure on product prices in 2005 compared to 2004 levels.

The company’s Canadian lumber and OSB operations were negatively affected by the strong Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
The U.S./Canadian lumber trade dispute has not been resolved. Duties continued in 2005 for Canadian companies selling lumber into the United States. However, anti-dumping duties paid by the company decreased in 2005, partially due to lower sales
resulting from the divestiture of the B.C. Coastal operations. The ongoing nature of the dispute and the multiple venues at which the cases are being heard leave uncertain the fate of the accumulated deposits.

The timberlands business was positively affected by the strength in wood products
production. Western timber prices benefited from strong lumber demand in the western U.S. markets and steady demand for log exports to Japan. Southern timber prices benefited from tight supply conditions caused by weather and market-related factors.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The term “company” refers to Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its majority-owned
domestic and foreign subsidiaries and variable interest entities of which Weyerhaeuser Company or its subsidiaries are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The term “Weyerhaeuser” refers to the forest products-based operations and
excludes the Real Estate and Related Assets operations. The term “price realizations” refers to net selling prices, which include freight and are net of normal sales deductions. The term “contribution to earnings” refers to
segment earnings before interest and taxes.

The company sold its B.C. Coastal
and French composites operations in 2005. The B.C. Coastal and French composites operations are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As a result, consolidated net sales and revenues and operating income
presented in the following table do not include activity of the discontinued operations.

Net sales and revenues increased $698
million, or 3 percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $493 million increase in single-family home sales, due to both strong demand and higher average sales prices, and increases in prices realized in 2005 for fine
paper and corrugated packaging.

Net earnings decreased $550 million, or 43
percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004. Items that affected net earnings included the following:

Ÿ

The company announced the closure or sale of a number of facilities in 2005 as a result of an ongoing strategic review. As a result, the company recognized net pretax charges for
closure of facilities of $693 million in 2005 as compared to $17 million in 2004. The majority of the 2005 charges were due to decisions to close the following facilities: Cosmopolis, Washington pulp mill; Dryden, Ontario paper machine; Plymouth,
North Carolina containerboard machine; and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan pulp and paper mill. In addition, the company has announced that it plans to sell its composite panels business. The strategic review is not complete and the company may announce
further closures or sales in the future.

Ÿ

Operating costs increased significantly across the company’s forest products businesses, due primarily to increases in the cost of energy, raw materials, and transportation.

Ÿ

Gross margins on sales of single-family homes increased $231 million primarily as a result of increases in average sales prices, a change in the mix of homes sold, and an increase
in the number of single-family home sales that were closed.

Ÿ

Price realizations in the company’s forest products businesses increased approximately $179 million due primarily to higher average sales prices for fine paper and corrugated
packaging.

Net sales and revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 14
percent, in 2004 as compared to 2003. Third-party sales were up in all of the company’s segments in 2004. The largest contributors to the increase were a $1.7 billion increase in sales of wood products, primarily due to a robust housing market
and exceptionally strong prices for wood products recognized in the second and third quarters of 2004, and a $463 million increase in single-family home sales, due to both strong demand and higher average sales prices.



Net earnings increased $1.0 billion in 2004
as compared to 2003. Items that affected net earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Wood Products contribution to earnings was up approximately $1.5 billion due primarily to higher average sales prices for most wood products.

Ÿ

The pretax cost incurred by Wood Products for delivered raw materials, production, and prices for building materials purchased for resale increased approximately $600 million.

Ÿ

Gross margins on sales of single-family homes increased approximately $200 million primarily as a result of increases in average sales prices and an increase in the number of
single-family home sales that were closed.

Net sales and
revenues and contribution to earnings for Timberlands, Wood Products and Corporate and Other, as presented in the segment discussions that follow, do include activity of the B.C. Coastal and French composites businesses that were sold in May 2005.

TIMBERLANDS

Timberlands sales volume and annual production data is included in “Business Segments” and “Properties” above. Following is a comparison of Timberlands net sales and revenues and contribution to
earnings from year to year:

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers in 2005 decreased $55 million, or 5 percent, from 2004 due primarily to a $61 million decrease in third-party log sales. Included in
the reduction of third-party log sales is a $22 million decrease in B.C. Coastal log sales. Results for 2005 include five months of B.C. Coastal operations as compared to a full year of operations in 2004. The volume of logs sold to export markets
decreased 12 percent and the volume of logs sold to domestic markets decreased 7 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. Third-party log price realizations decreased 2 percent in the West and increased 8 percent in the South. Overall log prices increased
in both the West and the South, but the company’s third-party price realizations in the West were lower in 2005, as compared to 2004, mainly due to changes in mix. The decrease in volume and slight decrease in Western mix, combined with the
reduction in sales due to the divestiture of the B.C. Coastal operations, more than offset the increase in prices in the South, resulting in an overall decrease in third-party sales and revenues year to year.

Ÿ

Intersegment sales increased $172 million, or 11 percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004. This includes a $91 million net increase in intersegment sales from the company’s
Canadian operations. Internal price realizations, which reflect current market values, increased in 2005, reflecting recovery of higher fuel costs, higher stumpage fees paid to the various Canadian provinces, and higher harvest costs due to wet
weather conditions. In the southern U.S., increased harvest of grade and pruned logs, which have higher internal price realizations, resulted in a $58 million increase in intersegment sales. Increased volume of logs harvested in the Western U.S.
that were directed to company mills and higher price realizations on those internal transfers resulted in an additional $23 million increase in intersegment sales in 2005 as compared to 2004.



Timberlands contribution to earnings
decreased $243 million, or 24 percent, in 2005 as compared to 2004. Items that affected the segment’s contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Gains on sales of nonstrategic timberlands decreased $301 million in 2005. The reduction is primarily due to the pretax gain of $271 million on the sale of timberlands in Georgia in
2004, with no comparable sales occurring in 2005.

Ÿ

Strong demand in the housing sector and improved sales mix in both the West and the South contributed to higher earnings for the segment. Improved price realizations and changes in
the mix of third-party and internal sales in the West resulted in a $37 million increase in contribution to earnings in 2005. Improved price realizations and an improved mix of grade versus fiber logs in the South resulted in a $62 million increase
in contribution to earnings in 2005 compared to 2004.

Ÿ

Harvest levels on fee lands in the South were comparable in 2005 and 2004, and harvest levels on fee lands in the West increased slightly, resulting in a positive variance of $6
million in 2005. Despite downtime experienced in the South due to the hurricane season, the overall weather pattern for harvest in both the South and West was more favorable in 2005 than in 2004.

Ÿ

Higher net operating costs in the West and South, primarily caused by increased fuel costs and extremely high cost hurricane salvage operations in the South, negatively affected
earnings by $25 million in 2005. As a result of increased fuel prices, the Southern operations experienced a $14 million increase in gas, oil and mineral revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004. Operations in the South also recognized an $11 million
charge in 2005 for timber damage caused by hurricane Katrina.

Ÿ

Contribution to earnings for 2005 includes earnings from the company’s B.C. Coastal operations through the date of sale in May 2005, compared to a full year of B.C. Coastal
earnings in 2004. This change resulted in a $44 million reduction in 2005 earnings compared to 2004.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues in 2004 increased $108 million, or 11 percent, over 2003, due primarily to a $92 million increase in log sales. The volume of logs sold to export markets
increased 6 percent and the volume of logs sold to domestic markets decreased 9 percent in 2004 compared to 2003. Log price realizations increased 18 percent in the West and 4 percent in the South, resulting in an increase in net sales and revenues
in 2004 even though overall volumes declined.

Contribution to
earnings increased $250 million, or 32 percent, in 2004. Items that affected the comparison of Timberlands contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Improved price realizations in the West resulted in a $123 million increase in contribution to earnings and improved price realizations in the South resulted in a $25 million
increase in contribution to earnings in 2004 compared to 2003. Strong demand and improved export log prices contributed to the improvement in the West, while tight supplies as a result of weather and other market factors resulted in increased prices
in the South. Higher prices in the B.C. Coastal operations contributed an additional $8 million in 2004.

Ÿ

Gains on sales of nonstrategic timberlands increased $108 million, or 33 percent, in 2004. Results for 2004 include a pretax gain of $271 million on the third quarter sale of
timberlands in Georgia, compared to pretax gains of $205 million on the sales of timberlands in western Washington, Tennessee and the Carolinas in 2003. Sales of other nonstrategic timberlands that closed earlier than expected resulted in a $42
million increase in 2004 contribution to earnings compared to 2003. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Ÿ

Lower harvest levels on fee lands, primarily in the South, negatively affected segment earnings by $27 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in harvest levels in the South
was primarily due to the sale of timberlands in Tennessee and the Carolinas, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2003, and in part due to the sale of timberlands in Georgia in the third quarter of 2004.



Ÿ

Higher harvest costs in the West and South, primarily caused by increased fuel costs and difficult hurricane salvage operations, negatively affected earnings by $17 million in 2004.
This was partially offset by a $14 million reduction in costs in the B.C coastal operations in 2004 compared to 2003.

OUTLOOK

Timberlands earnings in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be
similar to fourth quarter 2005.

WOOD PRODUCTS

Wood Products sales volume and annual production data is included in “Business Segments” and “Properties” above. Following is a comparison of Wood
Products net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings from year to year:

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues decreased $448 million, or 5 percent, in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower average sales prices and reduced shipment volumes in
softwood lumber, plywood, and OSB in 2005. U.S. housing starts on a seasonally adjusted basis averaged 2.07 million units in 2005 compared to 1.95 million units in 2004, indicating continued strong demand for building products. However,
increased supply of lumber and panel products by the industry kept pace with demand and resulted in lower prices. The company realized higher prices for its engineered lumber products, which helped to offset the softwood lumber and panels price
effects. Shipment volume of softwood lumber products declined in 2005, primarily as a result of the disposition of the company’s B.C. Coastal sawmills in May 2005. Shipment volume of structural panels declined primarily due to disposition of
plywood facilities in 2004, and an increase in the volume of OSB consumed internally in the manufacture of engineered lumber products.

Contribution to earnings for the segment decreased $570 million in 2005. Items that affected Wood Products contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

The segment realized higher prices for engineered lumber products, hardwood lumber, and residuals, contributing approximately $275 million more to segment earnings in 2005, as
compared to 2004. However, the lower average prices realized for softwood lumber and structural panels caused earnings to decrease by approximately $370 million from 2004. Reduced shipment volumes caused earnings to decrease by approximately $30
million.

Ÿ

Increases in costs for delivered raw materials, additives, energy, and other manufacturing elements negatively affected segment earnings by approximately $300
million in 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately two-thirds of



the cost increase was attributable to wood and resin cost. The remaining third was attributable to a variety of factors, including the Canadian exchange
rate, energy, maintenance, and freight.

Ÿ

Wood Products recognized net pretax charges related to the sale or closure of facilities of $99 million in 2005, primarily for the closure of a plywood mill at Wright City,
Oklahoma, the closure of a sawmill at Aberdeen, Washington, and the probable closure of a sawmill at Big River, Saskatchewan. This compares to a net pretax gain in 2004 of $66 million for integration, restructuring, and closure or sale of
facilities. The net pretax gain in 2004 includes $68 million for the sale of facilities, including an OSB mill in Slave Lake, Alberta, and a mill site on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

Ÿ

Segment earnings for 2005 also included a pretax gain of $6 million for compensation related to the tenure reallocation agreement in British Columbia and a pretax charge of $13
million recognized in connection with settlements in alder litigation matters. This compares to a pretax gain of $20 million recognized in 2004 for compensation related to the tenure reallocation agreement in British Columbia and a $20 million gain
recognized on the reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims. In addition, charges recognized in connection with settlements and an adverse judgment in alder litigation matters were $65 million in 2004.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $1.7 billion, or 20 percent, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher average sales prices realized in most product
lines, caused by strong markets in both new housing and in repair and remodeling related to high levels of existing home sales. The change in shipment volumes from 2003 did not have a significant effect on either the change in net sales and revenues
or on the change in contribution to earnings.

Contribution to
earnings, which represents segment earnings before interest and taxes, increased approximately $1.0 billion in 2004. Items that affected the comparison of Wood Products contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Higher average prices for most wood products, including structural panels, composite panels, softwood and hardwood lumber, and engineered lumber products contributed approximately
$1.5 billion to segment earnings in 2004 compared to 2003.

Ÿ

Increases in costs for delivered raw materials, production costs, and prices for building materials purchased for resale negatively affected segment earnings by approximately $600
million in 2004 compared to 2003. Approximately half of that increase was attributable to price increases on building materials purchased for resale. Of the remaining increase, approximately $210 million represented increases in costs for delivered
logs, OSB, veneer, machine stress rated (MSR) lumber, and chemical additives. Log costs in the West increased due to strong export and domestic demand. Log costs in the South increased due to the effects of weather and other market factors. Log
costs in Canada increased primarily as a result of increases in provincial stumpage rates. Costs of OSB, veneer, and MSR lumber used in the manufacture of engineered lumber products increased due to the strong new housing and repair and remodeling
markets noted above. Purchase costs for chemical additives used in the manufacture of panels and engineered lumber continued to increase due to an ongoing world-wide supply shortage and high demand. The remaining cost variance was attributable to a
variety of factors, including press downtime and repair costs at three OSB mills, as well as the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2004 compared to 2003.

Ÿ

Wood Products recognized a net pretax gain of $66 million for integration, restructuring and closure or sale of facilities in 2004 compared to net charges of $101 million in 2003.
The net gain in 2004 includes pretax gains of $68 million for the sale of facilities, including an OSB mill in Slave Lake, Alberta, and a mill site on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

Ÿ

Segment earnings for 2004 include a pretax gain of $20 million for compensation related to the tenure reallocation agreement in British Columbia and a $20 million gain recognized on
the reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims. In addition, charges recognized in connection with settlements and an adverse judgment in alder litigation matters were $65 million in 2004, compared to $79 million in 2003. See Note 15 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.



OUTLOOK

Wood Products earnings in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be similar to fourth quarter 2005.

CELLULOSE FIBER AND WHITE PAPERS

Cellulose Fiber
and White Papers sales volume and annual production data is included in “Business Segments” and “Properties” above. Following is a comparison of Cellulose Fiber and White Papers net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings
from year to year:

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $221 million, or 5 percent, for 2005 compared to 2004. This was largely due to an increase in fine paper price realizations of approximately $33 per
ton, or 4 percent, in 2005 compared to 2004, driven by a general improvement in U.S. economic conditions. Average pulp price realizations improved approximately $17 per ton, or 3 percent, in 2005 as fluff pulp price improvements more than offset a
decline in papergrade prices which were impacted by somewhat weaker offshore demand and increased European supply. Unit shipments of pulp declined approximately 56,000 tons or, 2 percent, and fine paper shipments increased approximately 120,000 tons
or 4 percent compared to 2004.

Contribution (charge) to
earnings was a loss of $444 million in 2005, compared to earnings of $104 million in 2004. Items that affected Cellulose Fiber and White Papers contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Increased price realizations on fine paper sales contributed approximately $132 million to segment earnings in 2005, and increased price realizations on pulp sales contributed
approximately $43 million to segment earnings in 2005 compared to 2004.

Ÿ

Energy and chemical costs increased in 2005, negatively affecting contribution to earnings for the segment by approximately $100 million. The cost increase was primarily due to
higher prices for natural gas and to chemical manufacturers passing along their costs increases, such as energy. Raw material costs also increased approximately $38 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to chip price increases.

Ÿ

Transportation costs increased approximately $75 million in 2005, due largely to fuel surcharges.

Ÿ

The strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2005 resulted in increased operating costs of the segment’s Canadian facilities when translated into U.S.
dollars, negatively affecting the segment’s earnings by approximately $62 million.

Ÿ

The segment recognized pretax charges of $449 million in 2005 for the closure of a specialty pulp facility at Cosmopolis, Washington, a pulp and paper facility at Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, and a paper machine at Dryden, Ontario. In 2004, the segment recognized pretax charges of $18 million related to restructuring and closure or sale activities.



2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $264 million, or 7 percent, for 2004 compared to 2003. This was largely due to an increase in pulp price realizations of approximately $49 per ton,
or 9 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. Average fine paper price realizations remained constant in 2004 compared to 2003. Stronger demand resulting from growth in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar resulted in an improved pulp market in 2004. During the
second half of 2004, general market conditions for fine paper improved significantly, resulting in improved product pricing, and offsetting general market weakness in the first half of the year when prices were below 2003 levels. Unit shipments for
both pulp and fine paper sales were higher in 2004 than in 2003. Pulp shipments increased approximately 79,000 tons or 3 percent, and paper shipments increased approximately 54,000 tons, or 2 percent, compared to 2003.

Contribution (charge) to earnings was $104 million in 2004, compared to a loss of $82
million in 2003. Items that affected the comparison of Cellulose Fiber and Fine Paper’s contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Increases in pulp prices contributed approximately $123 million to segment earnings in 2004 compared to 2003.

Ÿ

Operating efficiencies, reduced market downtime and ongoing cost savings associated with the closure of two paper machines during 2003, and other productivity improvements resulted
in cost reductions of approximately $136 million in 2004 compared to 2003. This was partially offset by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2004, which increased operating costs of the segment’s Canadian
facilities translated into U.S. dollars, and negatively affected the segment’s earnings by approximately $62 million in 2004 as compared with 2003.

Ÿ

Increased costs for raw materials, primarily chips, negatively affected segment earnings by approximately $45 million in 2004.

Ÿ

Freight costs were approximately $34 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to fuel surcharges and higher costs resulting from decreased availability of trucks, rail
cars, and marine vessels.

Ÿ

Cellulose Fiber and Fine Paper costs associated with integration, restructuring and closure or sale activities were $18 million in 2004, a decrease of $44 million from $62 million
in 2003, which included costs relating to the closure of two fine paper machines.

OUTLOOK

The company expects announced first quarter price increases for market pulp and fine paper to result in improved earnings in the
first quarter 2006 despite continued cost pressure.

CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND
RECYCLING

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling sales volume and annual production data is included in “Business Segments” and
“Properties” above. Following is a comparison of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings from year to year:



2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $172 million, or 4 percent, in 2005 as compared with 2004. Containerboard price realizations increased approximately $10 per ton, or 3 percent, in
2005 compared to 2004, and unit shipments increased approximately 45,000 tons, or 4 percent, in 2005. Price realizations for corrugated packaging increased $1.21 per thousand square feet, or 2 percent, while unit shipments increased 746 million
square feet, or 1 percent, in 2005 compared to 2004. According to the Fiber Box Association, industry unit shipments for corrugated packaging increased 0.2 percent in 2005 compared to 2004.

Contribution to earnings declined $254 million from $249 million in 2004 to a loss of $5
million in 2005. Items that affected the comparison of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Increases in corrugated packaging price realizations in 2005 positively affected the segment’s contribution to earnings by approximately $89 million and increases in
containerboard price realizations contributed approximately $10 million in 2005.

Ÿ

Non-fiber manufacturing costs at the company’s containerboard mills and packaging plants were approximately $123 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, due primarily to higher
costs for maintenance, energy, chemicals and supplies. Energy, supply and chemical costs increased primarily due to higher costs for fossil fuels. The purchase cost for natural gas increased approximately 26 percent in 2005 compared to 2004,
partially due to the significant impacts Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had on natural gas markets.

Ÿ

Transportation costs increased approximately $51 million in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to rising costs for energy and higher costs resulting from decreased
availability of trucks, rail cars, and marine vessels.

Ÿ

Net decreases in raw material costs in 2005 positively affected contribution to earnings by approximately $16 million. The cost of old corrugated containers (OCC) delivered to the
company’s containerboard mills decreased approximately $7 per ton. This benefit was partially offset by higher costs for chips delivered to the company’s containerboard mills which increased approximately $2 per ton in 2005.

Ÿ

Market-related downtime at the containerboard mills increased by approximately 23,000 tons in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to a delayed produce season following heavy
rainfall in California and Arizona in early 2005.

Ÿ

Segment results for 2005 include net pretax charges for restructuring and the closure of facilities of $137 million, compared to $13 million in 2004. Closures initiated during 2005
include seven packaging plants, a bag plant and the North Carolina containerboard machine. An additional four plants are currently for sale. Results for 2005 also include a $50 million pretax charge for the settlement of a class action linerboard
antitrust lawsuit. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $213 million, or 5 percent, in 2004 as compared with 2003. Approximately half of the increase is due to a 40 percent increase in sales of recycled
materials, resulting from both higher price realizations and higher unit shipments of recycled materials. The increase in sales of recycled materials reflects an overall increase in the demand for pulp, paper and containerboard, coupled with
incremental sales from a new supply source acquired in 2004. In addition, containerboard price realizations increased approximately $26 per ton, or 8 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003, and unit shipments increased approximately 111,000 tons, or 12
percent, in 2004, primarily due to productivity improvements in the company’s mills. Price realizations for corrugated packaging increased approximately 1 percent, while packaging unit shipments remained comparable in 2004 and 2003. According
to the Fiber Box Association, industry unit shipments for packaging increased 2.8 percent in 2004 compared to 2003.



Contribution to earnings declined $13
million from $262 million in 2003 to $249 million in 2004. Items that affected the comparison of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Increases in packaging price realizations in 2004 positively affected the segment’s contribution to earnings by approximately $34 million and increases in containerboard price
realizations contributed approximately $26 million in 2004. Increased price realizations for recycled materials were substantially offset by increases in costs for materials purchased or brokered by the recycling division.

Ÿ

Non-fiber manufacturing costs at the company’s containerboard mills and packaging plants were approximately $12 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to a facility
closure in the third quarter of 2003 and increased productivity in the containerboard mill system. The overall reduction in non-fiber manufacturing costs was achieved despite increased costs for energy in 2004, which resulted mainly from higher
purchase prices for natural gas. Productivity in the containerboard mill system, measured on a tons produced per operating day basis, improved 3 percent in 2004 compared to 2003.

Ÿ

Freight costs were approximately $12 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to fuel surcharges and higher costs resulting from decreased availability of trucks, rail
cars, and marine vessels.

Ÿ

Increases in raw material costs in 2004 negatively affected contribution to earnings by approximately $90 million. The cost of OCC delivered to the company’s containerboard
mills increased approximately $20 per ton and costs for chips delivered to the company’s containerboard mills increased approximately $3 per ton in 2004.

Ÿ

Market-related downtime at the containerboard mills decreased by approximately 269,000 tons in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to a facility closure in 2003 and improving
economic conditions.

Ÿ

Net pension expense was $19 million in 2004 compared to a net pension expense of $2 million in 2003.

Ÿ

Segment results for 2004 include net charges for property casualty losses, integration, restructuring, sale or closure of facilities of $13 million, compared to $18 million in 2003.
2003 also included a $23 million pretax charge for the settlement of a class action linerboard antitrust lawsuit. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

OUTLOOK

The company expects higher pricing and lower OCC costs to result in improved first quarter 2006 earnings for the segment.

REAL ESTATE AND RELATED ASSETS

Single-family unit statistics for Real Estate and Related Assets are included in “Business Segments” and “Properties” above.



Following are the key items that affected
the comparison of net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings for Real Estate and Related Assets from year to year:

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues increased $420 million, or 17 percent, driven by an increase in single-family revenues. Single-family revenues accounted for 92 percent of total revenues in
2005, compared to 88 percent of total revenues in 2004. In 2005, the segment generated single-family revenues of $2.7 billion, an increase of 22 percent compared to 2004, on closings of 5,647 units, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2004. The
average selling prices of single-family homes increased in all of the segment’s markets in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Contribution to earnings increased $124 million, or 20 percent, in 2005 compared to 2004. Items that affected the comparison of Real Estate and Related Assets
contribution to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Single-family gross margins (net sales less cost of goods sold and period costs) totaled $882 million, or 32.8 percent, in 2005, compared to $651 million, or 29.7 percent, in 2004.
Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 3.1 percentage points primarily as a result of increases in average sales prices in all markets and a change in mix of homes sold. All markets generated improvements in both gross margin dollars and
gross margin percentages. Volume improvements of 383 additional closings further contributed to the single-family margin increase and contribution to earnings. Improvements in average sales price and volume were partially offset by cost increases
resulting from the mix of the company’s closed units and also from overall cost increases in construction materials and transportation costs.

Ÿ

Contribution to earnings for 2005 includes net pretax gains of $79 million on land and lot sales compared to $75 million in 2004.

Ÿ

Increases in selling, general and administrative expenses due to higher revenue-driven selling costs, information technology expenses and variable compensation expenses partially
offset improvements in contributions to earnings related to margins. As a percentage of single-family revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at 9.5 percent in 2005 compared to 9.4 percent in 2004.

Ÿ

Contribution to earnings in 2005 includes a fourth quarter pretax impairment charge of $33 million on unimproved land. Impairment charges in 2004 totaled less than $1 million.

Ÿ

Contribution to earnings in 2004 includes an $18 million gain on the sale of an option on land.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues and contribution to earnings increased in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to increases in the quantity and prices for single-family home sales closed.
All of the geographic markets in which Real Estate and Related Assets homebuilding businesses operate remained strong in 2004 due largely to low mortgage interest rates. Single-family gross margin for the homebuilding businesses (net sales less cost
of goods sold and period costs) was 29.7 percent in 2004 compared to 25.7 percent in 2003.



Ÿ

Contribution to earnings for 2004 includes net pretax gains of $75 million on land and lot sales compared to $41 million in 2003. Net gains on commercial and multi-family project
sales were $14 million in 2003. There were no comparable sales in 2004.

OUTLOOK

The backlog of homes sold, but not closed, as of December 25, 2005, is approximately 2,410 units, which is comparable to the
backlog as of December 26, 2004. The company expects earnings from the Real Estate and Related Assets segment in the first quarter of 2006, to decline seasonally from the fourth quarter of 2005 due to decreased single-family home closings.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Corporate and Other includes marine
transportation (Westwood Shipping Lines, a wholly owned subsidiary); timberlands, distribution and converting facilities located outside North America; and general corporate support activities.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

Net sales and revenues of the Corporate and Other segment were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Contribution (charge) to earnings for the segment improved by $487 million in 2005, as compared to 2004. Items that affected
the comparison of contribution (charge) to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Corporate and Other recognized a $63 million pretax gain on the sale of the B.C. Coastal operations and a $57 million pretax gain related to a deferred gain from previous timberland
sales in the second quarter of 2005. The segment also recognized a $115 million pretax gain on the sale of its investment in MAS Capital Management in the third quarter of 2005 and recognized a $57 million pretax gain on the sale of the French
composites operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. See Notes 3, 4, 19 and 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Ÿ

Results of the company’s international operations declined by approximately $40 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, partially due to a market downturn in Australia that
resulted in lower price realizations and decreased sales volumes in the company’s Australian wood products distribution business and partially due to a $15 million pretax impairment charge recognized on the company’s investment in a New
Zealand joint venture. In February 2006, the company announced its intent to sell its New Zealand assets.

Ÿ

Variable compensation expense, which relates primarily to corporate-sponsored employee incentive compensation plans with awards based on either total company financial performance
or changes in the market price of the company’s common shares, was $22 million in 2005 compared to $69 million in 2004.

Ÿ

Interest income included in the Corporate and Other segment totaled approximately $89 million in 2005 compared to interest income of approximately $15 million included in 2004.
Amounts recognized in 2005 include approximately $52 million of interest income related to consolidated special-purpose entities. This activity was not fully consolidated in 2004. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Ÿ

Included in the segment’s contribution to earnings is a $43 million pretax credit for the cumulative effect to begin capitalizing Weyerhaeuser interest on excess qualifying
assets of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.



Ÿ

Charges for 2004 also include a pretax charge of $29 million recognized in connection with the impairment of assets in the company’s French composites operations and a pretax
charge of $23 million recognized in connection with the donation of technology to a university. There were no comparable charges in 2005.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

Net sales and revenues of the Corporate and Other
segment increased $83 million, or 17 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003.

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues of the company’s international operations increased approximately 29 percent in 2004, due in part to a strong Australian housing market that resulted in
increased prices and increased sales volumes for the company’s Australian wood products distribution business. In addition, sales volumes in the company’s European composites business increased in 2004 primarily resulting from increased
production on a continuous press that was installed during 2003.

Ÿ

Net sales and revenues of Westwood Shipping Lines increased approximately 12 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily as a result of increases in container rates, primarily
import containers, and increased shipment volumes.

Charge to
earnings increased $95 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Items that affected the comparison of Corporate and Other charge to earnings included the following:

Ÿ

Foreign exchange transactions gains were $26 million in 2004 compared to $107 million in 2003. Foreign exchange gains and losses result from changes in exchange rates primarily
related to the company’s Canadian and New Zealand operations.

Ÿ

Variable compensation expense, which relates primarily to corporate-sponsored employee incentive compensation plans with awards based on either total company financial performance
or changes in the price of the company’s common shares, was $69 million in 2004 compared to $44 million in 2003.

Ÿ

Pretax gains recognized in connection with the settlement of Cemwood insurance claims were $7 million in 2004 compared to $25 million in 2003.

Ÿ

Charges for integration and restructuring in the Corporate and Other segment were $20 million in 2004 compared to $63 million in 2003. The decrease in integration and restructuring
charges in 2004 is primarily due to a $26 million decrease in expenses recognized in connection with change-in-control agreements related to the Willamette acquisition and a decrease in severance costs recognized in connection with the
company’s overall cost-reduction efforts. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Ÿ

Charges for 2004 also include a pretax charge of $29 million recognized in connection with the impairment of assets in the company’s French composites operations and a pretax
charge of $23 million recognized in connection with the donation of technology to a university. There were no comparable charges in 2003.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense incurred by Weyerhaeuser was $739 million,
$838 million and $815 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense incurred in 2005 included $45 million of interest incurred by special purpose entities the company has consolidated. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below. Interest expense incurred also included pretax charges of $35 million recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and $73 million recognized in the second and
fourth quarters of 2004 in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the interest expense of the special purpose entities and excluding the losses on early extinguishment of debt, interest expense decreased $106 million in 2005 as
compared to 2004 and decreased $50 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. The decrease in interest expense is principally the result of a net reduction in debt of approximately $2.0 billion in 2005 and approximately $1.9 billion in 2004.



Interest expense incurred in the Real Estate
and Related Assets segment is fully capitalized to qualifying assets under development. As disclosed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below, the company made a change
in the fourth quarter of 2005 to begin capitalizing Weyerhaeuser interest on qualifying assets of Real Estate and Related Assets. The change would have increased Weyerhaeuser capitalized interest $50 million, Weyerhaeuser cost of sales $32 million,
and quarterly net earnings $2 million to $4 million per quarter in 2005 if the company had followed this accounting practice for all of 2005. Future activity will be dependent on the level of qualifying real estate assets and debt held by Real
Estate and Related Assets and the timing and volume of sales of qualifying real estate assets.

INCOME TAXES

The company’s effective income tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.8 percent for 2005, 33.3 percent for
2004, and 33.4 percent for 2003. The company’s effective income tax rate is affected by state income taxes and the benefits of tax credits.

During the third quarter of 2005, the company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $14 million resulting from a change in the Ohio state income tax law. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, the company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $7 million resulting from a change in the British Columbia income tax law.

During the second quarter of 2005, the company recognized a $46 million income tax benefit in connection with the sale of the company’s B.C. Coastal operations. See
Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below. The income tax benefit recognized upon the sale of the B.C. Coastal operations included a deferred tax benefit of $185 million
resulting from the rollout of temporary differences on the assets sold and a current tax expense of $139 million on the taxable gain. Current taxes reflect the benefit of favorable capital gains treatment applicable to the sale of timberlands in
Canada. Also during the second quarter of 2005, the company recognized a charge of $44 million for the accrual of income taxes associated with the repatriation of approximately $1.1 billion of foreign earnings. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Under current tax law, the ability to use tax credits from the production of non-conventional fuel would be phased out ratably if the average annual domestic wellhead price published by the Department of Energy (DOE) is $51 to $64 per
barrel (in 2004 dollars) and would be fully phased out if the top end of the price range is reached. Based on current domestic wellhead prices the company expects to be in the phase out range for 2006. Total phase out would result in a loss of $24
million in tax credits from the production of non-conventional fuel in 2006. The company’s ability to use these credits was not limited in 2005.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

The company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

, as of the beginning of 2003. The cumulative effect of adopting the accounting principle was $11 million, or 5 cents per
share, after taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

General

The company is committed to the maintenance of a sound and conservative capital structure. This commitment is based on two considerations: the obligation to protect the underlying interests of its shareholders and lenders and the desire to
have access, at all times, to all major financial markets.

The important
elements of the policy governing the company’s capital structure are as follows:

Ÿ

To view separately the capital structures of Weyerhaeuser and Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) and related assets, given the very different nature of their assets and
business activities. The amount of debt and equity associated with the capital structure of each will reflect the basic earnings capacity, real value, and unique liquidity characteristics of the assets dedicated to that business.



Ÿ

The combination of maturing short-term debt and the structure of long-term debt will be managed judiciously to minimize liquidity risk.

Operations

Consolidated net cash provided by operations was $1.7 billion in 2005, a decrease of $520 million from $2.3 billion of net cash provided by operations in 2004. The primary components of that net decrease are as follows:

Ÿ

Weyerhaeuser cash received from customers, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others, decreased approximately $580 million in 2005, as compared with 2004. This is
partially attributable to the decline in sales prices for lumber, plywood and OSB, which had been a significant source of cash flows in 2004. Increased raw material and manufacturing costs, particularly energy and chemicals, required the use of
additional cash in 2005. These effects were partially offset by additional proceeds from the sale of engineered lumber, fine paper and packaging products in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Ÿ

Real Estate and Related Assets cash received from customers, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others, increased approximately $68 million in 2005, as compared with 2004.
Additional single-family home closings in 2005 at higher average selling prices generated increased cash from customers. This was partially offset by increased homebuilding costs resulting from the mix of the company’s closed units, overall
cost increases in construction materials and transportation costs, and increased selling, general and administrative costs.

Ÿ

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $45 million lower in 2005 than in 2004. Interest paid in 2005 includes $45 million of interest paid by special purpose
entities the company has consolidated. Excluding the interest paid by special-purpose entities, cash paid for interest in 2005 decreased approximately $90 million from amounts paid in 2004, primarily due to approximately $3.8 billion of long-term
debt reduction since the beginning of 2004.

Ÿ

Net cash paid for income taxes was $632 million in 2005, an increase of $111 million over income taxes paid in 2004. Although pretax book income for the company decreased in 2005 as
compared to 2004, taxable income increased in 2005.

Consolidated net cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion in 2004, an increase of $462 million over $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operations in 2003. The primary components of that net increase are as follows:

Ÿ

Cash received by the company from customers increased approximately $2.7 billion in 2004 as compared with 2003. This increase was due primarily to an increase in cash received from
the sale of wood products and increased proceeds from Real Estate and Related Assets home sales.

Ÿ

Net cash paid to employees, suppliers and others by the company increased approximately $1.7 billion in 2004, compared with 2003. The $1.2 billion increase for Weyerhaeuser is
largely attributable to increases in the costs of raw materials used in the manufacture of various wood products, pulp, paper and containerboard, and in the cost of building materials purchased for resale. The increase of approximately $475 million
for Real Estate and Related Assets is attributable to an increase in the number of homes constructed and land acquired for future development.

Ÿ

Net cash paid for income taxes was $521 million in 2004, an increase of $542 million over cash received of $21 million in 2003. The increase in taxes paid is primarily due to tax
payments made on significantly higher pretax earnings during 2004.



Investing

Capital spending by segment, excluding acquisitions and Real Estate and Related Assets, were as follows:

Weyerhaeuser currently anticipates
capital expenditures for 2006, excluding acquisitions and Real Estate and Related Assets, of approximately $850 million; however, this level of capital expenditures could increase or decrease as a consequence of a number of factors, including future
economic conditions, weather and the timing of equipment purchases.

In May
2005, Weyerhaeuser closed on the sale of its B.C. Coastal operations to Coastal Acquisition Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brascan Corporation of Toronto, Canada. In October 2005, Weyerhaeuser sold a laminated beam facility in Eugene, OR, and in
December 2005, Weyerhaeuser closed on the sale of its French composite panels operations to Financiera Maderera S.A. (FINSA). The company received net cash proceeds of $1.2 billion (U.S.) from the sale of these operations. See Note 23 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

In July 2005, the company sold its interest in MAS Capital Management Partners, L.P., an equity investment, for net cash proceeds of $115 million. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

Internally
generated cash flows provided the cash needed to meet the company’s capital expenditure, investment and other requirements in 2005.

Financing

During 2005, the company, including Real Estate and Related Assets,
reduced long-term debt by approximately $2.0 billion. Total interest-bearing debt as of December 25, 2005, was $8.7 billion, down from $10.6 billion as of December 26, 2004. The company also paid premiums and other costs related to the
early extinguishment of debt of $32 million and $68 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Weyerhaeuser sold certain significant nonstrategic timberlands in 2003 and 2004 and received proceeds from special purpose entities of $302 million in 2004 and $358 million in 2003. See Notes 3 and 19 in Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

In October 2005, the company announced a stock repurchase program under which it is authorized to repurchase up to 18 million shares of common stock. As of December 25, 2005, the company had paid
approximately $11 million for the repurchase of 173,800 shares of common stock under the program.

On May 5, 2004, the company issued 16,675,000 common shares and received net proceeds from the offering, after deduction of the underwriting discount and other transaction costs, of $954 million. The company also
received $160 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2005, compared to $180 million received in 2004 and $60 million received in 2003. Higher average market prices for the company’s common shares during 2005 and 2004
compared to 2003, resulted in a significant increase in the number of employee stock option exercises.



The company’s debt-to-total capital
ratio is as follows:

Excluding the Real Estate and Related
Assets amounts disclosed above and excluding Weyerhaeuser’s investment in Real Estate and Related Assets of $1.5 billion as of December 25, 2005, $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2004, and $703 million as of December 28, 2003,
Weyerhaeuser’s debt-to-total-capital ratio was 39.0 percent, 43.6 percent and 52.0 percent as of the end of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The company’s intent, over time, is to pay dividends to common shareholders in the range of 35 to 45 percent of common share earnings. The company paid dividends of
$466 million in 2005, $372 million in 2004 and $355 million in 2003. Dividends paid in 2005 increased over amounts paid in 2004 and 2003. Effective with the second quarter of 2005, the company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.40 per share to
$0.50 per share. The increase in dividends paid in 2005 is also partially due to the increased number of common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of 16,675,000 shares of common stock in May 2004. Weyerhaeuser received payments of $157
million in 2003 from its Real Estate and Related Assets subsidiaries in the form of intercompany dividends and returns of capital. These intercompany payments are eliminated on a consolidated basis. No comparable intercompany dividends were paid in
2005 or 2004, as the Real Estate and Related Assets segment retained its earnings from those years to pursue other investment and growth opportunities.

Weyerhaeuser Company and WRECO have established two multi-year revolving lines of credit in the maximum aggregate amount of $2.0 billion as of December 25, 2005. The
$800 million multi-year revolving line of credit expires in March 2007 and the $1.2 billion multi-year revolving line of credit expires in March 2010. WRECO can borrow up to $400 million under the March 2010 facility. Neither of the entities is a
guarantor of the borrowing of the other under either of these credit facilities. In addition, during 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company Limited (Weyerhaeuser Limited), a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of the company, established a $200 million (Canadian)
multi-year revolving line of credit which expires in December 2008. Weyerhaeuser Company is a guarantor of the borrowings of Weyerhaeuser Limited under this facility. As of December 25, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Limited had fully drawn on this line of
credit. As of December 25, 2005, approximately $1.5 billion was available under these bank facilities for incremental borrowings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements have not had, and
are not reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the company’s current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 3 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated



Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below for disclosures of the company’s surety bonds, letters of credit
and guarantees, lot purchase option contracts with and subordinated financing provided to unconsolidated variable interest entities, and information regarding special purpose entities the company has consolidated.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations as of December 25, 2005. See Notes 7, 13 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

(1)

Amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of December 25, 2005 will remain outstanding until maturity, and interest
rates on variable-rate debt in effect as of December 25, 2005 will remain in effect until maturity. As of December 25, 2005, entities that Weyerhaeuser consolidated under Interpretation 46R had $34 million of long-term debt obligations
subject to interest rate swap agreements. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below. Interest payments related to this debt are included in the above amounts at the
fixed rate obligation the consolidated entities have incurred under these interest rate swap agreements.

(2)

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including:
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

Hardboard Siding Claims

The company announced in June 2000 it had entered into a proposed nationwide settlement of class action suits relating to sales of hardboard siding and, as a result, took
a pretax charge of $130 million to cover the estimated cost of the settlement and related claims. The court approved the settlement in December 2000. An appeal of the settlement was denied in March 2002, and the settlement is now binding on all
parties.

The company reassessed the adequacy of these reserves and increased
its reserves by an additional $43 million during 2001. Claims and related costs in the amount of $5 million in 2005, $7 million in 2004 and $11 million in 2003 were paid against the reserve. In the third quarter of 2004, an adjustment was made to
reduce the reserve by $20 million based upon a review of the activities and trends over the preceding four years.

The company has negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of certain costs related to these claims. As of the end of 2005, the company had received
payments from insurance carriers in the amount of $52 million. For further discussion regarding this matter, including claims data, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
below.



Other

Additional discussion of environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies is included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

Critical Accounting Policies

The company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” below. The company’s critical accounting policies are those that may involve a higher degree of judgment, estimates and complexity. The company believes its most critical accounting policies include those related to the
company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, potential impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, reserves for matters such as legal and environmental issues and product liability reserves, and depletion accounting. While the company
bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Plans

The company sponsors several pension and postretirement benefit plans for its employees. Key assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded
in the company’s financial statements include the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, anticipated trends in health care costs, assumed increases in salaries, mortality rates, and other factors. These assumptions are reviewed with
external advisors at the end of each fiscal year and are updated as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on the company’s financial position, results from operations or cash flows.
Other factors that affect the level of net periodic benefit income or expense that is recognized in a given year include actual pension fund performance, plan changes, and changes in plan participation or coverage.

The company’s expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the company’s best
estimate regarding the long-term rate of return on plan assets based on the information that was available as of the measurement date, including historical returns for the last 20 years. As of December 25, 2005, the company is using an expected
rate of return on pension plan assets assumption of 9.5 percent. This assumption, which will be used in the determination of the 2006 net periodic benefits costs, is the same assumption that was used for 2005 and 2004. Each 0.5 percent reduction in
the expected return on plan assets would increase the 2006 pension plan expense by approximately $20 million for the company’s U.S. qualified pension plans and by approximately $5 million for the company’s Canadian registered pension
plans.

The discount rate for both the U.S. and Canadian plans is based
on yields for corporate bonds, rated AA or better, by matching cash flows to a spot rate yield curve. As of December 25, 2005, the company reduced the discount rate from 6.00 percent to 5.90 percent for the U.S. plans and from
6.00 percent to 5.15 percent for the Canadian plans to reflect decreases in the benchmark rates of interest. Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2006 will be based on the 5.90 percent assumed discount rate for U.S. plans and 5.15 percent
for the Canadian plans. Future discount rates may differ. Each 0.5 percent reduction in the assumed discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $19 million for the company’s U.S. qualified pension plans and by approximately $8
million for the company’s Canadian registered pension plans.

The company
had no obligation to and did not make any contributions to its U.S. qualified pension plans during 2005. Benefits of approximately $16 million for the U.S. nonqualified plan were paid from general assets of the company as this plan is not prefunded.
The company contributed approximately $46 million to its registered and nonregistered Canadian pension plans in 2005. The company expects it will not have an obligation to make contributions to its U.S. plans during 2006 and expects to contribute a
total of approximately $47 million to its Canadian plans during 2006.

Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

The company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets and goodwill
when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. In addition, goodwill is assessed annually in the fourth quarter for impairment. In order to determine whether
long-lived assets and goodwill are impaired, and the amount and timing of impairment charges, the company is required to estimate future cash flows, residual values and fair values of the related assets. Key assumptions used in those calculations
include the probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material costs, volumes



of product to be sold and discount rates. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in
estimates of such cash flows, changes in the likelihood of alternative outcomes, and changes in estimates of fair value could affect the evaluations.

The company has grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years. A large portion of the net book value of the company’s property and equipment and timber
and timberlands represent amounts allocated to those assets as part of the allocation of the purchase price of recent acquisitions. Due to these allocations, a large portion of the company’s long-term assets are valued at relatively current
amounts. In addition, the company had goodwill of $3.0 billion as of December 25, 2005, which represented approximately 11 percent of the company’s consolidated assets.

All of the company’s reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005. As disclosed above under
“Economic and Industry Factors Affecting Operations,” a trend towards electronic substitution for paper may represent a fundamental change in the marketplace for the company’s paper products. Cellulose Fiber and White Papers lost $444
million in 2005, including pretax charges for closure of facilities of $449 million. Further restructuring activities, protracted economic weakness, or poor operating results, among other factors, could trigger an impairment of Cellulose Fiber and
White Papers’ goodwill in the near term. As of December 25, 2005, the carrying amount of goodwill for the Cellulose Fiber and White Papers segment was $857 million.

Legal, Environmental and Product Liability Reserves

Contingent liabilities, principally for legal, environmental and product liability matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and
excessive verdicts do occur. As disclosed in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below, the company’s legal exposures are significant and the ultimate outcome of these
legal proceedings could be material to operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year.

Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. The company determines these estimates after a detailed
evaluation of each site. In establishing its accruals for environmental remediation, the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may
be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate has been taken into account, based generally on each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis. The company
does not record amounts for recoveries from insurance carriers until a binding agreement has been reached between the company and the carrier.

Additionally, reserves for future claims settlements relating to hardboard siding cases require judgments regarding projections of future claims rates and amounts.

Depletion

Depletion, or costs attributed to timber harvested, is recorded as trees are harvested. Depletion rates are adjusted annually. Depletion
rates are computed by dividing the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion by the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle. The length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and
species of timber. The depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for future silviculture costs associated with existing stands, future reforestation costs associated with a stand’s final harvest, or future volume in connection with
the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.

Significant
estimates and judgments are required to determine the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle. Some of the factors affecting the estimates are changes in weather patterns, the effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,
changes in environmental regulations and restrictions that may limit the company’s ability to harvest certain timberlands, changes in harvest plans, the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology, and changes in harvest cycles.

Prospective Pronouncements

See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below for a summary of prospective accounting
pronouncements.



FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some information included in this report contains statements concerning the
company’s future results and performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as “expects,” “may,” “will,” “believes,” “should,” “approximately,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and “plans,” and the negative or other
variations of those terms or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. In particular, some of these forward-looking statements deal with expectations regarding the company’s markets in the first quarter of 2006,
expected earnings and performance of the company’s business segments during the first quarter of 2006, demand and pricing for the company’s products in the first quarter of 2006, expected raw material, energy, chemical, transportation and
manufacturing costs in the first quarter of 2006, expected capital expenditures in 2006, facility closings and related charges, new home sales and closings, effect of Canadian exchange rate, the effect of adverse litigation outcomes and the adequacy
of reserves, the effect of regulations, the effect of changes in accounting principles, contributions to pension plans, projected benefit payments, projected tax rates and expected loss of tax credits, and related matters. The accuracy of such
statements is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

The effect of general economic conditions, including the level of interest rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar and housing starts;

Ÿ

Market demand for the company’s products, which may be tied to the relative strength of various U.S. business segments;

Ÿ

Energy prices;

Ÿ

Raw material prices;

Ÿ

Performance of the company’s manufacturing operations;

Ÿ

The successful execution of internal performance plans;

Ÿ

The level of competition from domestic and foreign producers;

Ÿ

The effect of forestry, land use, environmental and other governmental regulations;

Ÿ

The effect of weather;

Ÿ

The risk of loss from fires, floods and other natural disasters;

Ÿ

Transportation costs;

Ÿ

Legal proceedings;

Ÿ

Performance of pension fund investments and related derivatives; and

Ÿ

Changes in accounting principles.

The company is also a large exporter and is affected by changes in economic activity in Europe and Asia, particularly Japan, and by changes in currency exchange rates,
particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, and restrictions on international trade or tariffs imposed on imports, including the countervailing and anti-dumping duties imposed on the company’s
softwood lumber shipments from Canada to the United States. These and other factors could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the
events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur, or if any of them occurs, what effect they will have on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. The company expressly declines any obligation to publicly
revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date of this report.



QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The fair value of the company’s fixed-rate debt is affected by changes in market rates of interest. A summary of the company’s long-term debt obligations, including scheduled principal repayments and
weighted average interest rates, as of December 25, 2005, follows:

Occasionally, the company uses
derivative instruments to achieve a desired mix of fixed versus floating rate debt in its capital structure, to hedge commitments for short or long positions in commodities the company produces or purchases, to manage exposure to foreign exchange
rate fluctuations, and to eliminate or create other exposures to investments or liability commitments that are less efficiently managed in the cash or physical markets. The fair value of derivative contracts may vary due to the volatility of the
expected underlying forward prices or index rates associated with such contracts.

As of December 25, 2005, the company had commodity futures, swaps and collars with an annual notional value of $252 million, an aggregate notional value of $308 million and an aggregate fair value of approximately $56 million. As of
December 25, 2005, commodity swaps with a notional value of $201 million, were accounted for as cash flow hedges and the remaining commodity swaps with a notional value of approximately $107 million were marked to market and changes in fair
market value were recognized in earnings in the period of change. A 10 percent change in the forward price levels would result in a change in the fair value of the commodity contracts of up to approximately $31 million. This sensitivity excludes the
offsetting impact of the price changes on underlying physical product purchases or sales, and excludes any sensitivity reduction due to negative and/or low correlations between commodities.

The company had an investment swap with a notional value of $126 million and a fair value of
approximately $1 million at December 25, 2005. The value at risk for this derivative is approximately $6 million, calculated by applying conservative probabilities of changes in the expected return based on historical results.

As of December 25, 2005, entities that the company has consolidated under Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised), had interest swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $34 million and a fair value representing a loss of less than $1 million.

AUDIT COMMITTEE

As of December 25, 2005, the Audit Committee was comprised of four independent directors (as defined in the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange) and is responsible for appointing the independent
registered public accounting firm, overseeing the audit work, and establishing procedures for receiving and processing complaints regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters. The Audit Committee reviewed with the company’s
management and with its independent registered public accounting firm the scope and results of the company’s internal and external audit activities and the adequacy of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. The committee
also reviewed current and emerging accounting and reporting requirements and practices affecting the company. Robert J. Herbold, former chair of the Audit Committee, retired as a director as of the company’s board meeting on February 16,
2006.



CERTIFICATIONS

The company has filed certifications under Rule 13a-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In
addition, the company has submitted to the New York Stock Exchange a certification that it is in compliance with the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 rules. Management, under our supervision, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 25, 2005. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2005, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Weyerhaeuser Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 25, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

Weyerhaeuser
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Weyerhaeuser Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Weyerhaeuser
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and shareholders’ interest and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2005, and our report dated February 21, 2006, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

, in 2003. Also, as
discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

December 26, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and shareholders’ interest and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2005. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 25, 2005

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its majority-owned domestic and foreign
subsidiaries, and variable interest entities of which Weyerhaeuser Company or its subsidiaries are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity
affiliates over which the company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method with taxes provided on undistributed earnings.

Certain of the consolidated financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in two groupings: (1) Weyerhaeuser, principally engaged in
the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and sale of forest products, and (2) Real Estate and Related Assets, principally engaged in real estate development and construction and other real estate related
activities. The term “company” refers to Weyerhaeuser Company, all of its majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and variable interest entities of which Weyerhaeuser Company or its subsidiaries are determined to be the primary
beneficiary. The term “Weyerhaeuser” refers to the forest products-based operations and excludes the Real Estate and Related Assets operations.

Nature of Operations

The
company’s business segments are:

Ÿ

Timberlands, which manages 5.7 million acres of company-owned and 0.7 million acres of leased commercial forestlands in North America (4.2 million acres in the southern
United States and 2.2 million acres in the Pacific Northwest and Canada). Timberlands also has renewable long-term licenses on 27.6 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada. The terms of the licenses are
described under “Timber and Timberlands” below.

Ÿ

Wood Products, which produces a full line of wood products that are sold primarily through Weyerhaeuser’s own sales organizations to wholesalers, retailers and industrial users
in North America, the Pacific Rim and Europe.

Ÿ

Cellulose Fiber and White Papers, which manufactures and sells pulp, coated and uncoated paper, and liquid packaging board in North American, Pacific Rim and European markets.

Ÿ

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling, which manufactures and sells containerboard in North American, Pacific Rim and European markets and packaging products for domestic and
Mexican markets, and which operates an extensive wastepaper recycling system that serves Weyerhaeuser mills and worldwide markets.

Ÿ

Real Estate and Related Assets, which is primarily engaged in developing single-family housing and residential lots for sale, including master planned communities, mainly in
selected metropolitan areas in California, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Washington.

Ÿ

Corporate and Other, which includes marine transportation (Westwood Shipping Lines, a wholly-owned subsidiary), distribution, timberlands and converting facilities located outside
North America, and general corporate support activities.

Fiscal Year End

The company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of the calendar year. Each of the
company’s fiscal years in 2005, 2004 and 2003 had 52 weeks.

Accounting Pronouncements Implemented

The company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(Statement 143), as of the beginning of 2003. Statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The cumulative effect of adopting the accounting principle, after a tax benefit of $6 million, was a charge of $11 million, or 5
cents per share, basic and diluted.



The adoption of the following recent
accounting pronouncements did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition:

Ÿ

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

Ÿ

Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

Prospective Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(Statement 123R)

,

in December 2004. Statement 123R is
a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(Statement
123)

.

Statement 123R requires the fair value of employee awards issued, modified, repurchased or cancelled after implementation under share-based payment arrangements to be measured as of the grant dates. The resulting cost will then be
recognized in the statement of earnings over the service period. The company will implement Statement 123R as of the beginning of fiscal year 2006, as permitted by a Securities and Exchange Commission Rule that was issued in April 2005. The company
is currently evaluating the effect that Statement 123R will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows when Statement 123R is adopted.

The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151,

Inventory Costs – An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

(Statement 151), in
November 2004. Statement 151 amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4,

Inventory Pricing

, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of “so abnormal” as stated in ARB No. 43. Additionally, Statement 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversions be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. Statement
151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of Statement 151 will have on
its financial position and results of operations, but does not expect it to be material.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial Instruments

The company
has, where appropriate, estimated the fair value of financial instruments. These fair value amounts may be significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows. Accordingly, the estimates presented
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Where these estimates approximate carrying value, no separate disclosure of fair value is shown.

Derivatives

The company uses well-defined financial contracts in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage its foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks. The company also
uses other contracts that either do not provide for net settlement or are fixed-price contracts for future purchases and sales of various commodities for which the company applies the “normal purchases or normal sales” exclusion for
accounting purposes.

The effective portions of changes in the fair value of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in
earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized in earnings.

Changes in the fair value of all other derivative instruments not
accounted for as hedges are also recognized in earnings in the period in which the changes occur.



Certain commodity contracts, primarily
related to the purchase of energy, have been designated as cash flow hedges. In addition, entities that operate mills on a contract basis for the company and that the company has consolidated under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December
2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, have variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements entered into with a bank in which the entities pay fixed rates and receive floating rates with the interest payments calculated on a
notional amount. The interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as cash flow hedges by the consolidated entities and changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in minority interest.

In addition, the company has the following contracts that are not being accounted for as
hedges:

Ÿ

Variable rate swap agreement entered into with a major financial institution in which the company pays a floating rate based on LIBOR and receives a floating return based on an
investment fund index, with payments calculated on a notional amount. The swap is an overlay to investments and provides diversification benefits. The swap is settled quarterly and marked to market at each reporting date. All unrealized gains and
losses are recognized in earnings currently.

Ÿ

Selected over-the-counter commodity contracts and lumber futures designed to manage the company’s purchases, sales and inventory. The swaps are settled monthly and the futures
are settled on expiration. Both swaps and futures are marked to market at each reporting date. All unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings currently.

The company is exposed to credit-related gains or losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments but does
not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The annual notional amounts of the company’s derivative financial instruments were $418 million and $387 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004,
respectively. The aggregate notional amounts of these derivative financial instruments were $474 million and $486 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively. These notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged
by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to the company through its use of derivatives. The exposure in a derivative contract is the net difference between what each party is required to pay based on contractual terms. The
company’s use of derivative instruments resulted in gains of approximately $22 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and $8 million in 2003.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents. Short-term investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to cost more than half of domestic
raw materials, in process and finished goods inventories. LIFO inventories were $669 million and $670 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively. The balance of domestic raw material and product inventories, all
materials and supplies inventories, and all foreign inventories is costed at either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or moving average cost methods. Had the FIFO method been used to cost all inventories, the amounts at which product inventories are
stated would have been $240 million and $203 million greater at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively.

Property and Equipment

The
company’s property accounts are maintained on an individual asset basis. Improvements to and replacements of major units are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line
method at rates based on estimated service lives. Amortization of logging railroads and truck roads is provided generally as timber is harvested and is based upon rates determined with reference to the volume of timber estimated to be removed over
such facilities.

The cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or
retired is removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.

Timber and Timberlands

Timber and timberlands are carried at cost less depletion charged to disposals.
Depletion is the cost of standing timber and is charged to fee timber disposals as fee timber is harvested, lost as a result of casualty,



or sold. Generally, all initial site preparation and planting costs are capitalized as reforestation. Reforestation is transferred to a merchantable
(harvestable) timber classification after 15 years in the South and 30 years in the West. Generally, costs incurred after the first planting, such as fertilization, vegetation and insect control, pruning and precommercial thinning, property taxes
and interest, are considered to be maintenance of the forest and are expensed as incurred. Accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting commences.

Depletion rates used to relieve timber inventory are determined with reference to the net
carrying value of timber and the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. The growth cycle volume considers regulatory and environmental constraints affecting operable acres, management strategies to be applied,
inventory data improvements, growth rate revisions and recalibrations, and the exclusion of known dispositions and inoperable acreage. The cost of timber harvested is included in the carrying values of raw material and product inventories and in the
cost of products sold as these inventories are sold to third parties.

Weyerhaeuser also holds forest management licenses in various Canadian provinces. The provincial governments grant these licenses for initial periods of 15–25 years, and the licenses are renewable every five years, provided the company
meets normal reforestation, operating and management guidelines. Calculation of fees payable on harvested volumes varies from province to province, but is tied to product market pricing and the allocation of land management responsibilities agreed
to in the license.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assessed for
impairment at least annually using a fair-value-based approach. The company’s annual assessment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.

Accounts Receivable

The company periodically sold Canadian trade accounts receivable with limited recourse to an independently capitalized trust that, in turn, sold an undivided interest in the pool of receivables to a major
international financial institution. The facility provided a competitive source of funding and was limited to $200 million (Canadian) at any one point in time, of which a maximum of $60 million could be denominated in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar
equivalent of the sold receivables portfolio was $86 million as of December 26, 2004. The program was terminated in January 2005.

Accounts Payable

The company’s
banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented for payment. Accordingly, there were negative book cash balances of $284 million and $227 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26,
2004, respectively. Such balances result from outstanding checks that had not yet been paid by the bank and are reflected in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Pension Plans

The company has pension plans covering most of its employees. Both the U.S. and Canadian
plans covering salaried employees provide pension benefits based on each employee’s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of
stated amounts for each year of service. The benefit levels for these plans are typically set through collective bargaining agreements with the unions representing the employees participating in the plans. Contributions to U.S. plans are based on
funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Contributions to Canadian plans are based on funding standards established by the applicable Provincial Pension Benefits Act and by the Income Tax Act.

Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions

In addition to providing pension benefits, the company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees and
accrues the expected future cost of these benefits for its current eligible retirees and some employees over the period during which those employees provide services to the company. All of the company’s salaried employees and some hourly
employees may become eligible for these benefits when they retire.



Revenue Recognition

Weyerhaeuser operations generally recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to their customers, except for export sales
where revenue is recognized when title transfers at the foreign port.

The
company’s Real Estate and Related Assets operations are primarily engaged in the development, construction and sale of residential homes. Real estate revenues are recognized when closings have occurred, required down payments have been
received, title and possession have been transferred to the buyer, and all other criteria for sale and profit recognition have been satisfied.

Shipping and Handling Costs

The
company classifies shipping and handling costs in costs of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

The
company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. This statement requires management to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.
The primary method used to estimate fair value is discounted cash flows.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

The company’s stock-based compensation plans are described in Note
21: Stock-Based Compensation Plans. The company continues to apply the intrinsic-value method for stock-based compensation to employees prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations.

As described in “Prospective Accounting Pronouncements,” APB Opinion No. 25
will be superseded by Statement 123R effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2006. Employee awards issued, modified, repurchased or cancelled after implementation of Statement 123R under share-based payment arrangements will be measured at fair
value as of the grant dates and the resulting cost will be recognized in the statement of earnings over the service period.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and net earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement

to stock-based employee compensation. The company has consistently defined the past year as the service period for purposes of applying the fair value recognition provisions of Statement 123. As a result, stock-based employee compensation
expense is reflected as of the option grant dates in the following table.

Foreign Currency Translation

Local currencies are considered the functional currencies for most of the company’s operations outside the United
States. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the year.

Real Estate and
Related Assets

Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The determination of fair value is based on appraisals and market
pricing of comparable assets, when available, or the discounted value of estimated future cash flows from these assets. Real estate and land held for development is stated at cost to the extent it does not exceed the estimated undiscounted future
net cash flows, in which case it is carried at fair value.



Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior years’ data to the current format.

NOTE 2. NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share information follows:

Basic net earnings per share are
based on the weighted average number of common and exchangeable shares outstanding during the respective periods. Diluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common and exchangeable shares and stock options outstanding
at the beginning of or granted during the respective periods, calculated using the treasury stock method.

Options to purchase 2,500 shares in 2005, 153,900 shares in 2004 and 4,377,743 shares in 2003 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the
average market prices of common shares during those periods.

The dilutive
effect of outstanding stock options on net earnings per share is presented in the following table:



NOTE 3. CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST
ENTITIES

The company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(Interpretation 46R), as of March 28, 2004. Interpretation 46R addresses consolidation of certain entities in which equity investors do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

During 2002 through 2004, the company sold certain significant nonstrategic timberlands. See
Note 19: Significant Sales of Nonstrategic Timberlands. The company began consolidating the assets and liabilities of the buyer-sponsored special purpose entities and the monetization special purpose entities (collectively “the SPEs”)
involved in these transactions as of December 26, 2004, as the result of a re-evaluation of Interpretation 46R. However, because the SPEs are separate and distinct legal entities from the company, the assets of the SPEs are not available to
satisfy the liabilities and obligations of the company and the liabilities of the SPEs are not liabilities or obligations of the company. As of December 26, 2004, deferred gains on the sales of nonstrategic timberlands of $59 million were
included in “Liabilities (nonrecourse to Weyerhaeuser) held by special purpose entities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2005, following completion of the re-evaluation of Interpretation 46R,
the balance of these deferred gains was recognized in income, resulting in a $57 million pretax gain on previous timberlands sales.

Sales proceeds paid to buyer-sponsored SPEs are invested in restricted bank financial instruments of $909 million as of both December 25, 2005, and December 26,
2004. As of December 25, 2005, maturities of the bank financial instruments were as follows: $110 million in 2012, $184 million in 2013, $253 million in 2019, and $362 million in 2020. The weighted average interest rate on the bank financial
instruments was 5.15 percent as of December 25, 2005, and 4.5 percent as of December 26, 2004. The monetization SPEs had long-term debt of $756 million as of December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004. As of December 25, 2005,
maturities of the debt were as follows: $92 million in 2012, $153 million in 2013, $209 million in 2018, and $302 million in 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the debt was 5.50 percent as of December 25, 2005, and 4.85 percent as of
December 26, 2004. The monetization SPEs are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the banks, but the company does not expect the banks to fail to meet their obligations. The accompanying consolidated statement of
earnings includes interest expense on SPE debt of $45 million and interest income on SPE investments of $52 million in 2005. No comparable activity is included in interest income or interest expense in 2004 or 2003.

The company’s real estate development subsidiaries enter into options to acquire lots
at fixed prices in the ordinary course of business, primarily for the purpose of building single-family homes. In addition, a subsidiary in the Real Estate and Related Assets segment provides subordinated financing to third-party developers and
homebuilders. Both fixed-price purchase options and subordinated financing constitute variable interests under Interpretation 46R. The company’s real estate subsidiaries have consolidated five entities under Interpretation 46R, with estimated
assets and liabilities of $62 million as of December 25, 2005, and $45 million as of December 26, 2004. As of December 25, 2005, the company’s real estate development subsidiaries have 16 lot option purchase agreements entered
into prior to December 31, 2003, with deposits of approximately $38 million at risk. After exhaustive efforts, the company has not been able to obtain the information necessary to determine whether or not it is required to consolidate any of
these entities under Interpretation 46R. The total amount that would be paid under these purchase options, if fully exercised, is approximately $160 million. In addition, as of December 25, 2005, the company’s real estate development
subsidiaries have 15 lot option purchase agreements with entities created after December 30, 2003, with deposits of approximately $16 million at risk, where the company is not the primary beneficiary and is not required to consolidate the
entities. The total amount that would be paid under these option purchase agreements, if fully exercised, is approximately $231 million. One of the company’s real estate subsidiaries has approximately $10 million in subordinated loans at risk
at December 25, 2005, in 32 variable interest entities.

NOTE 4. EQUITY
AFFILIATES

Investments in unconsolidated equity affiliates over which
the company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method with taxes provided on undistributed earnings.



Weyerhaeuser

Weyerhaeuser’s significant equity affiliates as of December 25, 2005, are:

Ÿ

Liaison Technologies, LLC — A 29 percent owned joint venture formed to develop and operate global, web-enabled, business-to-business connectivity, catalog content and timber
trading services for the paper, forest products and affiliated industries.

Ÿ

Nelson Forests Joint Venture — An investment in which Weyerhaeuser owns a 51 percent financial interest and has a 50 percent voting interest, which holds Crown Forest License
cutting rights, freehold land and related assets on the South Island of New Zealand. In February 2006, the company announced its intent to sell its New Zealand assets.

Ÿ

North Pacific Paper Corporation — A 50 percent owned joint venture that has a newsprint manufacturing facility in Longview, Washington.

Ÿ

Optiframe Software LLC — A 50 percent owned joint venture that develops whole-house design and optimization software for the building industry.

Ÿ

RII Weyerhaeuser World Timberfund, L.P. — A 50 percent owned limited partnership that invests in timberlands and related assets outside the United States. This
partnership’s primary focus is in plantation forests in Uruguay and Australia.

Ÿ

Southern Cone Timber Investors Limited — A 50 percent owned joint venture that has invested in timberlands in Uruguay. The entity’s primary focus is in plantation forests
in Uruguay.

The company sold its interests in SCA Weyerhaeuser
Packaging Holding Company Asia Ltd. (SCA) in June 2004 and MAS Capital Management Partners, L.P. (MAS) in July 2005. The company received net cash proceeds of approximately $115 million for the sale of its interest in MAS and recognized a pretax
gain on the sale of MAS of approximately $115 million in the third quarter of 2005. This gain is included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.

Unconsolidated financial information for affiliated companies accounted for by the equity
method, including information for SCA and MAS for the periods that the company held interests in SCA and MAS, are as follows:

Weyerhaeuser provides goods and
services to these affiliates, which vary by entity, in the form of raw materials, management and marketing services, support services and shipping services. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser purchases finished product from certain of these entities. The
aggregate total of these transactions is not material to Weyerhaeuser’s results of operations.



Real Estate and Related Assets

Unconsolidated financial information for unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method is as follows:

NOTE 5. GOODWILL

The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
during 2005:

Goodwill associated with the
company’s B.C. Coastal operations was included in the carrying value of the net assets of B.C. Coastal and was written off in connection with the B.C. Coastal sale which occurred during the second quarter of 2005. The balance of this goodwill
as of December 26, 2004, was classified as “Assets of discontinued operations” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the reconciliation above. Both the Timberlands and Wood Products segments had
goodwill associated with the B.C. Coastal operations.

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are comprised of the following:



Provisions for income taxes from continuing
operations include the following:

A reconciliation between the federal
statutory tax rate and the company’s effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations is as follows:

The net deferred income tax assets
(liabilities) of continuing operations include the following components:



The deferred tax assets (liabilities) of
continuing operations are comprised of the following:

During the third quarter of 2005, the
company recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $14 million resulting from a change in the Ohio state income tax law. During the fourth quarter of 2005, a one-time reduction in the British Columbia provincial corporate income tax rate was also
enacted producing a one-time deferred tax benefit of $7 million. Both benefits were due to the effect of the lower tax rates on accumulated temporary differences.

As of December 25, 2005, the company and its subsidiaries have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $256 million, which expire
from 2008 through 2014 and $154 million which do not expire.

The company
intends to reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; therefore, no U.S. taxes have been provided on such earnings. These earnings totaled approximately $680 million through the end of 2005. Determination of the income tax
liability that would result from repatriation is not practicable.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) became law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. Based on this legislation and 2005 guidance by the
Department of Treasury, the company repatriated $1.1 billion of foreign earnings in July 2005. A charge of $44 million related to the repatriation was accrued in the second quarter of 2005 and is included in income taxes (from continuing operations)
in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.

The company
previously disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has asserted that approximately $322 million of solid waste disposal revenue bonds do not qualify as tax-exempt. The company has settled this dispute with the IRS with respect to $175
million of the bonds, and continues to contest the assertion with respect to the remaining bonds, none of which are outstanding. The remaining tax issues are in the appeals process. The company does not expect any future charges related to this
matter to have a material or adverse affect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

As of December 25, 2005, $14 million of the $97 million valuation allowance would be allocated to reduce goodwill if the tax benefits are subsequently recognized. The net $21 million decrease in the valuation
allowance from December 26, 2004, to December 25, 2005, is a result of the following: $42 million decrease is due to sale of discontinued operations; $3 million decrease is due to expired tax credits; $10 million increase is due to
acquired foreign losses; and $14 million increase is due to additional foreign losses. The valuation allowance increased by $13 million from December 28, 2003, to December 26, 2004, due to an increase in foreign losses and credits,
partially offset by expired tax credits.

NOTE 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT
BENEFIT PLANS

The company sponsors several retirement programs for
its employees. In the United States, this includes pension plans that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (qualified) as well as a plan that provides benefits in addition to



those provided under the qualified plans for a select group of employees, which is not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (nonqualified). In Canada,
plans are registered under the Income Tax Act and under their respective provincial pension acts (registered), or plans may provide additional benefits to a select group of employees, and not be registered under the Income Tax Act or provincial
pension acts (nonregistered). Retiree medical and life plans are offered in both countries. These plans are typically not prefunded. The company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit
obligations and fair value of plan assets over the two-year period ended December 25, 2005:

The company funds its qualified and
registered pension plans and a portion of its nonregistered plans. The company accrues for nonqualified pension benefits and health and life postretirement benefits. The company does not expect to have an obligation to fund its U.S. plans in 2006,
but does expect to contribute approximately $47 million to its Canadian pension plans in 2006.



The company estimates the projected benefit
payments under its U.S. and Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans over the next ten years will be as follows:

The funded status of these plans at
December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, is as follows:

Assets at year end are estimated due
to timing and the nature of the underlying investments. The estimated pension asset value as of December 26, 2004, was $4.8 billion compared to an actual asset value of $5.0 billion. The estimated postretirement asset value as of
December 26, 2004, was approximately $3 million compared to an actual asset value of approximately $2 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all of the company’s defined benefit pension plans was $4.8 billion and $4.4 billion at December 25, 2005, and
December 26, 2004, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1 billion, $968 million and $780 million, respectively, as of December 25, 2005, and $887
million, $818 million and $617 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2004.



DESCRIPTION OF INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES

Qualified and
Registered Plans

The strategy of the U.S. pension trust is to invest directly and via total return partnership swaps in a diversified mix of nontraditional strategies,
including hedge funds, private equity, opportunistic real estate and other externally managed alternative investment funds. Equity index and fixed income derivative instruments are used to supplement the market exposures embedded in such
investments. These additional financial instruments constitute indirect investments held by the U.S. pension trust that serve to increase the return and risk profile of the investment portfolio. The overall return earned by the pension trust is the
aggregate of returns earned on direct investments and returns earned on the derivatives. The Canadian pension trust has a similar investment strategy. However, it concentrates direct investments into cash and cash equivalents while gaining return
exposures through financial instruments, such as total return and index swaps. The company has not established target allocations for the direct investment portfolio or the derivatives.

The qualified and registered plans are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to the indirect investments but the company
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. However, because there are no exchanges of principal on the indirect investments, only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk. The company manages this risk through
selection of counterparties with a defined minimum credit quality, diversification, settlement provisions and documented agreements. Investments in hedge funds and private partnerships are controlled through selection and diversification of managers
and strategies and use of limited liability vehicles. Portfolio risk is managed through diversification and by constraining the risk profile of the portfolio within defined boundaries.

Nonregistered Plans

The Canadian nonregistered plans are funded using Retirement Compensation Arrangements (RCAs). Under Canadian tax rules, 50 percent of any contribution to an RCA goes to a non-interest-bearing refundable tax account
held by the government. This means that on average over time, it is expected that approximately 50 percent of the plans’ assets are not invested. The invested portion of the plans’ assets consists of a portfolio of equities.

Retiree Life
Insurance

The plan is funded by a Premium Deposit Fund (PDF) held by the insurance carrier. The fund is used to pay premiums for current retirees covered under the U.S.
retiree life insurance plan for salaried employees. The company’s intent is to pay these premiums from the fund and to make no future contributions to the fund. It is expected that the fund will be fully drawn down in the next fiscal year or
shortly thereafter.

ALLOCATION OF ASSETS BY CATEGORY



DERIVATIVES

The approximate fair value of derivatives held by the qualified and registered plans as of December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, is as follows:

The total approximate notional amount
of derivatives held by the qualified and registered plans as of December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, is as follows:

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

The assumptions used in the measurement of the company’s benefit obligations are as follows:



The components of net periodic benefit costs
are as follows:

The assumptions used in the
measurement of the company’s net periodic benefit costs are as follows:

DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN
ASSETS ASSUMPTION

Qualified and Registered Plans

The expected return on plan assets assumption reflects the company’s best estimate regarding the long-term expected return on the U.S. portfolio. The expected return assumption is based on historical fund
returns. The Canadian fund’s investment strategy has mirrored that of the U.S. plan since 1998. Over the period of 20 years during which this investment strategy has been pursued, the U.S. fund has achieved a net compound annual return of 17.5
percent. The determination of the expected return on plan assets assumption requires a high degree of judgment and places weight on more recent pension plan asset performance. The expected return on plan assets assumption as of December 25,
2005, is comprised of the following expected returns:



The composition of the actual return on plan
assets in each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2005, is as follows:

Nonregistered Plans

The expected rate of return on the assets supporting the nonregistered plans is 4.75 percent per year. This includes an expected
long-term rate of return on the equity portion of this portfolio of 9.50 percent per year based on a combination of historical experience and future return expectations. As noted above, 50 percent of contributions to this plan are held in a
non-interest-bearing account held by the Canadian government.

Retiree Life Insurance

The expected long-term rate of return on this fund is 3.79 percent. This is based on historical interest
credited on the fund.

In addition to the company-sponsored
pension and postretirement plans discussed above, approximately 3,700 employees are covered by union-administered multi-employer pension plans to which the company makes negotiated contributions based generally on fixed amounts per hour per
employee. Contributions to these plans were approximately $13 million in 2005 and 2004, and $16 million in 2003.

The company also sponsors multiple postretirement plans for its U.S. employees. Medical plans have various levels of coverage and plan participant contributions. Life
insurance plans are noncontributory. Canadian employees are covered under multiple postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance benefits.

The company sponsors various defined contribution plans for U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. The basis for determining plan contributions varies by plan.
The amounts contributed to the plans for participating employees were approximately $61 million, $57 million, and $58 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTE 12. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES
OF CREDIT

Borrowings

Weyerhaeuser had $3 million in short-term borrowings outstanding as of both December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004.

The Real Estate and Related Assets segment’s short-term borrowings were $7 million,
including a $3 million non-interest bearing note, at December 25, 2005, and $2 million on one non-interest bearing note at December 26, 2004. Weyerhaeuser Company guarantees commercial paper borrowings of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company
(WRECO) in return for a fee equal to one-quarter of 1 percent of the outstanding commercial paper balance. To keep the guarantee, WRECO has agreed to maintain unused non-guaranteed credit arrangements that are equal to or greater than the
outstanding commercial paper. WRECO paid no fees to Weyerhaeuser in 2005. Fees paid by WRECO to Weyerhaeuser Company were less than $1 million in 2004 and 2003.

Lines of Credit

Weyerhaeuser
Company had a short-term bank credit line of $1.2 billion under a 364-day revolving facility at December 26, 2004. The 364-day revolving line of credit expired in March 2005.

In March 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company and Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) entered into a $1.2 billion 5-year revolving credit
facility to replace the 364-day revolving credit facility that expired. The new 5-year facility expires March 2010. WRECO can borrow up to $400 million under this facility. Neither Weyerhaeuser Company nor WRECO is a guarantor of the borrowings of
the other under this facility.

In addition, Weyerhaeuser Company has a
revolving credit facility agreement entered into with a group of banks that expires in March 2007 and that provided for borrowings up to a total amount of $1.3 billion, all of which was available to Weyerhaeuser Company. In August 2005, the company
reduced the capacity under this facility to $800 million, all of which is available to Weyerhaeuser Company. Borrowings are at LIBOR plus a spread or other such interest rates mutually agreed to between the borrower and lending banks.

In December 2005, Weyerhaeuser Limited entered into a revolving credit facility agreement
with a group of banks that expires in December 2008 and that provides for borrowings up to a total amount of $200 million (Canadian), or approximately $172 million (U.S), all of which was fully drawn upon as of December 25, 2005. Weyerhaeuser
Company is a guarantor of the borrowings of Weyerhaeuser Limited under this facility.

As of December 25, 2005, the company has $517 million in letters of credit against the March 2010 credit facility, primarily related to an appeal bond posted in the Paragon litigation (see Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingencies). Of the total committed bank facilities of $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion was available as of December 25, 2005, for incremental borrowings.

Other

Weyerhaeuser has entered
into letters of credit in the amount of $636 million and surety bonds with an estimated amount of $758 million as of December 25, 2005. As of December 26, 2004, Weyerhaeuser had entered into letters of credit in the amount of $124 million
and surety bonds with an estimated amount of $249 million. As discussed above, the increase in letters of credit and surety bonds from December 26, 2004, to December 25, 2005, is primarily due to the appeal bond posted in the Paragon
litigation.



The Real Estate and Related Assets segment
has entered into letters of credit in the amount of $32 million and $22 million and surety bonds with an estimated amount of $559 million and $575 million as of December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively.

The company’s compensating balance requirements were not significant.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Hardboard Siding Claims

In June 2000, the company entered into a nationwide
settlement of hardboard siding class action cases and recognized a charge of $130 million before taxes to cover the estimated cost of the settlement and related claims. The settlement class consists of all persons who own or owned structures in the
United States on which the company’s hardboard siding had been installed from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1999. This is a claims-based settlement, which means the claims will be paid as submitted over a nine-year period. An
independent adjuster reviews claims submitted and determines payment under the terms of the settlement agreement. Reserves for future claims settlements relating to hardboard siding cases require judgments regarding projections of future claims
rates and



amounts. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, the company had approximately $52 million in reserves remaining for hardboard siding claims. The company
believes the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate, but is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges, if any, that may be required for these matters in the future.

The following table presents an analysis of the claims activity related to the hardboard
siding class action cases:

The lower average damage award paid
in 2004 was due primarily to a lower number of awards for multi-family structures in 2004 than in 2003 or 2005.

The company has received $52 million in recoveries from its insurance carriers by way of negotiated settlements.

The company currently has no litigation pending with any person or entity that has opted out
of the settlement. Individuals and entities that have opted out of the settlement may file lawsuits against the company in the future.

Linerboard Antitrust Litigation

In
May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the company in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Both suits named as defendants several other major containerboard and packaging producers. The complaint in the first
case alleged the defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of corrugated containers. The suit requested class certification for purchasers of corrugated containers
during the period from October 1993 through November 1995. The complaint in the second case alleged that the company conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price of corrugated sheets. The suit requested class certification
for purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period from October 1993 through November 1995.

The company settled the two lawsuits and a pretax charge of $23 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2003. Approximately 165 members of the classes opted out of the class and filed thirteen lawsuits against
the company and other producers. The company settled three of the lawsuits and recognized a pretax charge of $12 million in the first quarter of 2005. The company settled all but one of the remaining opt-out cases and recognized a pretax charge of
$38 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The company believes that the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate, and expects the amount of additional charges, if any, that may be required for the sole remaining opt-out case to
be inconsequential.

In March 2004, La Cie McCormick Canada Company filed a
class action lawsuit in Superior Court of Justice, in Ontario, Canada against the company and other linerboard manufacturers on behalf of all Canadians who purchased corrugated products, including sheets and containers and/or linerboard, during the
period of time from 1993 to at least the end of 1995. The allegations mirror the allegations in the U.S. cases. General damages of $25 million and $10 million in punitive damages are sought. At this stage, the company cannot calculate what portion
of the damages requested would be argued as the company’s responsibility. Canadian law does not provide for a trebling of antitrust damages. The company has not recorded a reserve for the matter, and does not expect any future charges that may
be taken for this matter to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Alder Antitrust Litigation

In
December 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the company in U.S. District Court in Oregon (the Initial Alder Case) alleging from 1996 to the present the company had monopoly power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the Pacific Northwest market for
alder logs and finished alder lumber. A jury verdict of trebled damages of $79 million was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the decision was upheld. In September 2005, the company asked for discretionary review of
the Initial Alder Case by the U.S. Supreme Court. In November 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court asked the Solicitor General to express the opinions of the United States on whether to accept review.



In January 2005, the company received a copy
of a “complaint in equity” filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon to set aside the judgment in the Initial Alder Case on behalf of a plaintiff who did not prevail in the trial. It alleged a fraud was committed on the court and requested
judgment against the plaintiff be vacated and a new trial set on plaintiff’s claim of monopolization of the alder sawlog market. Trebled damages of $20 million are alleged. The U.S. District Court stayed this matter until the U.S. Supreme Court
takes final action in the Initial Alder Case. The company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter.

In June 2003, Washington Alder filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in U.S. District Court in Oregon alleging monopolization of the alder log and lumber markets
and seeking trebled damages of $36 million and divestiture of the company’s Northwest Hardwoods Division and alder sawmills in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. A jury verdict of trebled damages of $16 million was appealed to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. After oral argument in November 2005, the matter was stayed pending a final disposition by the U.S. Supreme Court of the Initial Alder Case.

In 2004 the company settled similar lawsuits filed against the company by five hardwood mill owners in the U.S. District Court in Oregon.

In April 2004, a civil class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against the
company in U.S. District Court in Oregon claiming that as a result of the company’s alleged monopolization of the alder sawlog market in the Pacific Northwest as determined in the Initial Alder Case, the company monopolized the market for
finished alder and charged monopoly prices for finished alder lumber. In December 2004, the Judge issued an order certifying the plaintiff as a class representative for all U.S. purchasers of finished alder lumber between April 28, 2000, and
March 31, 2004, for purposes of awarding monetary damages. The company denies the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter. In February 2005, class counsel notified the court that approximately 5 percent of the
class members opted out of the class action lawsuit. The company has no litigation pending with any entity that has opted out of the class, but it is possible that entities who have opted out may file lawsuits against the company in the future. The
case was stayed in the fourth quarter of 2005 pending the U.S. Supreme Court entering a final opinion in the Initial Alder Case.

Changes in the amount accrued for alder antitrust litigation matters follows:

While the company believes the
reserve established for the alder antitrust litigation is adequate, the company is unable to estimate what additional charges, if any, may be required in the future, because of the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process.

Paragon Trade Brands, Inc.
Litigation

In 1999, the Equity Committee (Committee) in the Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. (Paragon), bankruptcy proceeding commenced an adversary proceeding against the company
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia asserting the company breached certain warranties in agreements between Paragon and the company connected with Paragon’s public offering of common stock in February 1993. The
Committee sought to recover damages sustained by Paragon in two patent infringement cases, one brought by Procter & Gamble and the other by Kimberly-Clark. In June 2002, the Bankruptcy Court held the company liable for breaches of warranty.
In the second quarter of 2005, the Bankruptcy Court imposed damages of approximately $470 million. The company appealed the liability and damages determinations to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and posted a bond of
$500 million. The company has not established a reserve for this matter because, based upon the information currently available to the company, including management’s belief that an adverse result is not probable because the company will
prevail on appeal, management believes the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(Statement 5), for establishing a reserve in this matter have not been



met. However, there is no guarantee that management will not determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any damage award is required. Any
such charge could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations for the quarter or the year in which such a charge may be recognized.

Other Litigation

The company is
party to other matters generally incidental to its business in addition to the matters described above.

Summary

Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a great
many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, management currently believes that adequate reserves have been established for probable losses from litigation when the amounts could be reasonably determined. Management further
believes that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings could materially adversely affect results of operations, cash flows or financial condition in any given quarter or year, but will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s
long-term results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Countervailing and
Anti-dumping Duties

Softwood Lumber Imported into the United States from Canada

In April 2001, the
Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (Coalition) filed two petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Department) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) claiming that production of softwood lumber in Canada was being subsidized by Canada and
that imports from Canada were being “dumped” into the U.S. market (sold at less than fair value). The Coalition asked that countervailing duty (CVD) and anti-dumping (AD) tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

In March 2002, the Department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain
Canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market price for stumpage. The Department established a final CVD rate of 18.79 percent. In the AD proceedings, the Department found that the six Canadian manufacturers examined,
including the company, were engaged in sales at less than fair value and set cash deposit rates ranging from 2.18 percent to 12.44 percent. The company’s deposit rate was set at 12.39 percent. Because of statutory limitations that affected
timing, the bonds covering duties following the preliminary determinations were released by the United States. The resulting reversal of accrued expenses was included in earnings during 2002.

In May 2002, the ITC confirmed its earlier ruling that U.S. industry is threatened by
subsidized and dumped imports and the company began making cash deposits relating to the CVD and AD actions. In June 2003, the Department began the process of the annual reviews to determine the final duty rates under both CVD and AD for annual
periods commencing with the period from May 22, 2002, through March 31, 2003, for CVD and through April 30, 2003, for AD. The annual review process will be conducted covering successive one-year periods for five years. In 2007, both
the CVD duty and AD orders will be automatically reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping will continue or a countervailing subsidy is likely to recur if the relevant order were to be revoked. As a result of
administrative determinations and the first and second annual administrative reviews, the combined CVD and AD rate charged on Weyerhaeuser shipments of Canadian softwood lumber into the United States was reduced from 31.18 percent to 24.36 percent
effective for the first quarter of 2005, and from 24.36 percent to 13.13 percent effective for the first quarter of 2006.

On December 2, 2005, the company filed a request with the Department for a review of its cash deposit rate due to the sale of the B.C. Coastal Group to Brascan in
May 2005. The company believes that the sale constitutes a changed circumstance and the cash deposit rate should be substantially lower. On January 19, 2006, the Department announced that it will conduct a changed circumstances review.

The CVD and AD tariffs are currently under review and challenge in several
forums, including NAFTA panels, the ITC, and the WTO. These proceedings include:

Appeals of Administrative Reviews.

The company has appealed the AD determination in the First Administrative
Review to the Court of International Trade (CIT). On the same date, the Coalition appealed both the CVD and AD determinations to the CIT. The various actions filed in the CIT relating to the AD determination have been consolidated by court order.
Both parties have also appealed the CVD determination in the First Administrative Review to NAFTA panels. It is expected that both parties will file appeals of the final determinations in the Second Administrative Review to NATFA panels.



NAFTA Injury Panel.

On September 1, 2004, the NAFTA Injury Panel ordered the ITC to reverse its earlier decision of injury and on September 11,
2004, the ITC agreed that the U.S. softwood lumber industry is not threatened with material injury by reason of softwood imports from Canada. In October 2004, the NAFTA Panel affirmed the ITC’s decision. The final NAFTA decision on injury was
challenged by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) before a newly constituted panel called the Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC). In August 2005, the ECC upheld the NAFTA decision on injury. The Coalition has filed a constitutional challenge
of NAFTA at the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

WTO Injury Review.

With the support of provincial governments, the federal government of Canada also moved for reviews by dispute
settlement panels under the World Trade Organization (WTO). In March 2004, a WTO panel announced its final ruling on injury, faulting an ITC finding of a threat of injury resulting from dumped and subsidized imports of softwood lumber from Canada.

In June 2004, pursuant to U.S. law, the USTR asked the ITC to provide an
advisory report as to whether it can implement the WTO’s decision against the ITC on threat of injury. In July 2004, the USTR also asked the ITC to issue a new decision on “threat of injury” to bring the United States into compliance
with the WTO decision finding against the ITC on injury. Section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act provides the basic provisions through which the U.S. implements new AD and CVD determinations to make them consistent with an adverse WTO
report. The ITC formally began the Section 129 review process in early August 2004 and issued a new determination on November 24, 2004, reaffirming that imports of Canadian softwood lumber pose a threat of injury to U.S. industry. In
January 2005, Canada requested that a NAFTA panel review this ITC decision on threat of injury. Canada has also sought authorization from WTO to impose $3.4 billion in sanctions on the U.S. for failure to revoke the CVD and AD deposits pursuant to
the WTO’s decision on injury. The U.S. challenged the Canadian request before the WTO. In November 2005, the WTO Panel issued a final decision upholding the ITC’s finding of injury. The decision has been appealed to the WTO Appellate Body.

WTO Review of AD and CVD
Determinations.

On August 11, 2004, the WTO Appellate Body held the U.S. practice of using zeroing to calculate antidumping margins during the investigation process was
improper. The Department has issued a new determination under Section 129 for AD rates to comply with the WTO’s determination which is currently on appeal to the WTO. On February 14, 2004, the WTO Appellate Body held that the
Department’s countervailing decision was contrary to the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. On November 9, 2004, the USTR asked the Department to undertake a Section 129 process to comply with the WTO Appellate
Body decision. Canada has sought a compliance review at the WTO for the failure of the U.S. to fully implement the WTO CVD decision. A decision is expected later in the year. In addition, Canada has filed a request for a NAFTA panel to review the
Section 129 CVD decision.

Byrd Amendment.

The WTO appeals body has affirmed a panel ruling against the United States that the so-called “Byrd Amendment,” which provides for
the distribution of AD and CVD duties to petitioners, is inconsistent with U.S. international obligations. On September 1, 2004, the WTO gave Canada and other countries the right to impose trade sanctions on the United States in retaliation for
collecting such duties and making them available for distribution under the Byrd Amendment. On March 31, 2005, Canada announced a retaliation surtax commencing May 1, 2005, of 15 percent against certain U.S. goods exported to Canada. The
aggregate amount of this surtax is approximately $14 million (Canadian). The U.S. Administration for a number of years signaled that it will introduce legislation to repeal the Byrd Amendment. The House of Representatives on November 18, 2005,
as part of a vote on other legislation, voted to repeal the Byrd Amendment, but the Senate amended the House repeal language when it voted to approve the repeal on December 21, 2005. The Senate amendment postpones the effect of the repeal until
October 1, 2007. On August 26, 2005, Canada filed a challenge to the Byrd Amendment in the U.S. Court of International Trade alleging that even under U.S. law, the Byrd Amendment is not applicable to Canada. Oral argument is scheduled for
April 2006 with a decision expected in July 2006. There also are two cases pending at the Court of International Trade (unrelated to the softwood case) challenging the constitutionality of the Byrd Amendment.

Through December 2005, the company has paid a cumulative total of $345 million in CVD and AD
duties and $21 million in related costs on softwood lumber the company has imported into the United States from Canada. The deposits made against the CVD and AD duties have been recognized as sales deductions in the consolidated statement



of earnings. It is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on the company. In the event that final rates differ from the depository rates,
ultimate charges may be higher or lower than those recorded to date. The company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges or reversals that may be necessary for this matter in the future. The company believes there should
be a negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute and supports efforts to reach a long-term solution to resolve this matter. The U.S. and Canadian governments continue to discuss ways to settle the softwood lumber dispute, but there can be
no assurance that they will be able to reach an agreement.

Kraft Liner/Linerboard Exported from the United States into the People’s Republic of China

In January 2004, the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (MOC) received a petition requesting an anti-dumping investigation on imports of
unbleached kraft liner/linerboard originating in the United States, Thailand, Korea and Taiwan. The MOC conducted an investigation based on the allegations contained in the petition for the period from January 1, 2003, to December 31,
2003, and an investigation for injury to the Chinese industry for the period from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2003. Weyerhaeuser and four other producers in the United States were included in the investigation. A final determination
was issued on September 30, 2005, setting Weyerhaeuser’s anti-dumping tariff at 12.9 percent, effective as of September 30, 2005. The anti-dumping duties were paid by Weyerhaeuser’s customers in China. In January 2006, the MOC
announced termination of its tariffs against the United States, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand due to procedural deficiencies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

In late 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
issued a notice of violation (NOV) for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at the company’s Hawesville, Kentucky, pulp and paper mill. The company settled the matter and paid a penalty of approximately $150,000.

In November 2004, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality — Air Quality
Division (DEQ) issued a NOV for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at the company’s Wright City, Oklahoma, wood products facility. Management has been discussing the issues with the DEQ to resolve the matters alleged in the NOV and
believes that settlement of the matter may include payment of a civil penalty of approximately $100,000.

In October 2005, the company notified the EPA and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources that a self-audit of its Flint River pulp mill in Oglethorpe, Georgia revealed certain areas that were not in compliance
with the Clean Air Act. The company has submitted a remediation plan to both agencies that is designed to get the mill back into compliance as quickly as possible. No penalties have been assessed or paid related to this matter.

In December 2005, the Ohio Attorney General’s Office notified Weyerhaeuser that it
plans to initiate a Clean Air Act enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser Company Packaging, Inc. (a former subsidiary of the company) arising out of its operation of corrugated container manufacturing plants in Valley View and Bedford Heights,
Ohio. The Attorney General’s Office has indicated that it plans to request injunctive relief and approximately $500,000 in civil penalties, of which a portion could be contributed to supplemental environmental projects identified by Ohio.
Management has been discussing resolution of the issue with Ohio EPA and the Attorney General’s Office.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
“Superfund,” and similar state laws. The EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the company that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted
against the company. The company has established reserves totaling $29 million for estimated remediation costs on all of the approximately 70 active sites across its operations. Environmental remediation reserves totaled $38 million at the end of
2004. The decrease in environmental remediation reserves reflects the incorporation of new information on all sites concerning remediation alternatives, updates on prior cost estimates and new sites, and the costs incurred to remediate these sites
during this period. The company accrued remediation costs of $5 million in 2005 and $9 million in 2004. The company incurred remediation costs of $14 million in 2005 and $10 million in 2004 and charged these costs against the reserve. Based on
currently available information and analysis, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals by up to $70 million, which may be incurred over several years. This
estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based, and utilizes assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably
possible outcomes. In estimating both its current accruals for environmental



remediation and the possible range of additional future costs, the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to
the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate has been taken into account, generally based on each party’s financial
condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis. No amounts have been recorded for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.

The company has not recognized a liability under Interpretation 47 for certain legal obligations, primarily special handling for the removal and disposal of encapsulated
asbestos from facilities and equipment. The fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the settlement dates are unknown.

GUARANTEES

Weyerhaeuser Company has guaranteed approximately $43 million of
debt that expires in 2006, but is subject to an annual extension. In addition, Weyerhaeuser Company sold its interest in a timberlands lease in the fourth quarter of 2005 and guaranteed the performance of the buyer/lessee. The lease expires in 2023
and total future lease payments are approximately $32 million. Weyerhaeuser Company recorded a $3 million liability as of the closing date of the sale.

As of December 25, 2005, the Real Estate and Related Assets segment has guaranteed approximately $22 million of debt of unconsolidated entities. The debt guarantees
expire as follows: $11 million in 2007 and $11 million in 2009.

WARRANTIES

WRECO provides warranties on homes that vary depending on state and local laws. The reserves for these warranties are determined by applying the
provisions of Statement 5. The liability was approximately $16 million and $14 million at December 25, 2005, and December 26, 2004, respectively.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods
or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the
transaction. Purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty. As of December 25, 2005, Weyerhaeuser’s future commitments under non-cancelable purchase obligations were as follows: $437 million in 2006,
$147 million in 2007, $89 million in 2008, $72 million in 2009, $58 million in 2010, and $581 million thereafter.

OPERATING LEASES

The company leases various equipment, office and wholesale
space, and model homes under operating leases. The equipment leases cover items including aircraft, vessels, rail and logging equipment, lift trucks, automobiles and office equipment. The company recognized rent expense of approximately $177
million, $181 million and $179 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The company’s future commitments under operating leases are as follows:



NOTE 16. OTHER OPERATING COSTS, NET

Other operating costs, net, is an aggregation of both recurring and
occasional income and expense items and, as a result, can fluctuate from year to year. Weyerhaeuser’s other operating costs, net, include the following (income) and expenses:

In the fourth quarter of 2005,
Weyerhaeuser recognized income of $43 million for the cumulative effect of a change to begin capitalizing Weyerhaeuser interest on qualifying assets of Real Estate and Related Assets. Following are the components of the adjustment:

The amount of Weyerhaeuser interest
capitalized to qualifying assets of Real Estate and Related Assets is dependent on the amount of qualifying real estate assets and the level of debt held by Real Estate and Related Assets. The amount of Weyerhaeuser interest that will be included in
Weyerhaeuser’s cost of products sold in future periods is dependent on the timing and volume of sales of qualifying real estate. Excluding the cumulative adjustment for periods prior to 2005, the net effect of the change would have been an
increase in consolidated net earnings of approximately $2 million to $4 million per quarter in 2005.

Included in (gain) loss on disposition of assets for 2004 is a net pretax gain of $43 million recognized in connection with the sale of operating facilities. This includes a pretax gain of $33 million that was
recognized in the first quarter on the sale of an oriented strand board (OSB) mill in Slave Lake, Alberta.

Asset impairment charges other than for closures for 2003 includes a pretax impairment charge of $16 million recognized in the second quarter of 2003 in connection with a facility sale that closed in 2003.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, Weyerhaeuser donated certain technology to a university. A
pretax charge of $23 million, representing the net carrying value of the donated technology, was recognized in 2004.

In 1999, American Cemwood Corporation (Cemwood), a subsidiary of MacMillan Bloedel Limited, which was acquired by the company in 1999, settled a class action suit
involving claims alleging the failure of its cement fiber roofing products. The settlement provided an opportunity for the company to recover a portion of the settlement amount, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed by the class against
Cemwood’s insurance companies. As a result of



settlements with the insurance companies, the company recognized a net pretax benefit of $25 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $7 million in the
fourth quarter of 2004. The company has an unresolved claim outstanding against a reinsurer.

Foreign exchange gains and losses result from changes in exchange rates, primarily related to Weyerhaeuser’s Canadian and New Zealand operations.

NOTE 17. CHARGES FOR INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING

As Weyerhaeuser has acquired businesses and consolidated them into its existing operations, Weyerhaeuser has incurred charges associated
with the transition and integration of those activities. Charges recognized from 2003 to 2005 for integration and restructuring included costs associated with the integration of Willamette and Weyerhaeuser’s overall cost-reduction efforts.

In connection with the acquisition of Willamette in 2002, Weyerhaeuser
entered into change-in-control agreements with several key Willamette employees. Under these agreements, Weyerhaeuser made payments of approximately $113 million through January 2004. Approximately $23 million of these payments represented severance
and other benefits paid to terminated Willamette employees. These costs were included in the total purchase price of the Willamette acquisition. Approximately $48 million represented other payments to terminated Willamette employees, primarily under
consulting and noncompete agreements that extended through the third quarter of 2004. Approximately $42 million represented payments to retained Willamette employees under retention and incentive agreements that extended through the first quarter of
2004 and noncompete agreements that extended through the third quarter of 2005. Costs associated with services were recognized over the periods benefited.

Costs incurred consist of the following:

As of December 25, 2005,
Weyerhaeuser accrued liabilities include approximately $15 million of severance accruals related to integration and restructuring charges recognized from 2003 through 2005. These accruals are associated with approximately 350 employee terminations
that have not yet occurred.

NOTE 18. CHARGES FOR CLOSURE OF FACILITIES

Facilities that do not represent a long-term strategic fit for the
company, or that cannot achieve top-quartile performance without significant capital investments, are assessed for closure or sale. Changing market conditions, increasing productivity at many of the company’s operating facilities and increased
scale as a result of recent acquisitions have provided the company with opportunities to rationalize its production capacity while retaining its ability to fulfill customer needs.

Weyerhaeuser closed a number of facilities during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Closures charges recognized in 2005 include costs related to the
closures of a pulp and paper facility, a specialty pulp mill, a fine paper machine, a containerboard machine, a large-log sawmill, two hardwood facilities, an I-joist facility, a veneer and plywood facility, seven corrugated converting plants and a
bag plant. The 2004 charges were primarily recognized in connection with the closure of one wood products facility and two packaging plants. The 2004 pension charges were recognized in connection with the final settlement of three pension plans
associated with facility closures. During 2004, approximately $12 million of estimated charges for severance and other costs associated with several closures that occurred from 2001 through 2003 were reversed as the related closure activities had
been finalized. During 2003,



Weyerhaeuser recognized closure costs in connection with the announced closures of eight wood products facilities, two fine paper machines, one
containerboard mill and one packaging plant.

Activities associated with these
closures are expected to continue through the end of 2006, but Weyerhaeuser does not expect to incur any additional material charges related to these closures. Charges for closure of facilities include:

Changes in accrued termination
benefits related to facility closures during the year ended December 25, 2005, were as follows:

NOTE 19. SIGNIFICANT SALES OF NONSTRATEGIC
TIMBERLANDS

During 2004 and 2003, the company closed the following
significant sales of nonstrategic timberlands:

The company has consolidated the
assets and liabilities of the buyer-sponsored special purpose entities and the monetization special purpose entities involved in these transactions (collectively “the SPEs”). See Note 3: Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

In addition to the amounts presented above, the company recognized gains of
$23 million in the second quarter of 2003 when a contingency lapsed on a portion of a timberland sale that closed in December 2002, and $57 million in the second quarter of 2005 when a re-evaluation of the consolidation of the SPEs under
Interpretation 46R was completed.



NOTE 20. SHAREHOLDERS’ INTEREST

Preferred

The company is authorized to issue:

Ÿ

Common Shares

A reconciliation of common share activity for the three years ended December 25, 2005, is as follows:

Included in the new shares issued in
2004 are 16,675,000 shares of common stock issued by the company on May 4, 2004. The company received net proceeds from the offering, after deduction of the underwriting discount and other transaction costs, of $954 million.

authorized to repurchase up to 18 million shares of common stock. As of December 25, 2005, the company had repurchased approximately 174,000 shares of common stock under the program.

Exchangeable
Shares

Weyerhaeuser Limited issued 13,565,802 exchangeable shares to common shareholders of MacMillan Bloedel in 1999 as part of the consideration paid to acquire
MacMillan Bloedel. No additional shares have been issued. These exchangeable shares are, as nearly as practicable, the economic equivalent of the company’s common shares; i.e., they have the following rights:

Ÿ

The right to exchange such shares for common shares of the company on a one-to-one basis.

Ÿ

The right to receive dividends, on a per-share basis, in amounts that are the same as, and are payable at the same time as, dividends declared on the company’s common shares.

Ÿ

The right to vote at all shareholder meetings at which the company’s shareholders are entitled to vote on the basis of one vote per exchangeable share.

Ÿ

The right to participate upon a liquidation event on a pro-rata basis with the holders of the company’s common shares in the distribution of assets of the company.



A reconciliation of exchangeable share
activity for the three years ended December 25, 2005, is as follows:

Cumulative Other Comprehensive Income

The company’s cumulative other comprehensive income includes the following:

NOTE 21. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The company’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan)
was approved at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase the company’s common stock at its market price on the date of grant by certain key officers and other employees of the company and
its subsidiaries who are selected from time to time by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant to Plan participants restricted stock, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares and other equity compensation on terms and conditions set by the Compensation Committee. In each case, equity granted to participants in the Plan must be at market price on the date of grant. As of the effective date of
the Plan, shares available for grant under prior plans of the company were canceled. No more than 17 million shares may be issued under the Plan, and participants are eligible to receive in any one calendar year options or stock appreciation
rights relating to a maximum of 500,000 shares, or restricted stock, performance shares or other equity grants aggregating a maximum of 200,000 shares. The aggregate number of shares that may be issued as grants other than options or stock
appreciation rights may not exceed 20 percent of the authorized number of shares. If all options outstanding at December 25, 2005, including some options that were previously granted under an earlier plan, and all remaining options that could
be granted under the Plan were exercised, the company’s common shares would increase by approximately 29 million shares. The term of options granted under the Plan may not exceed 10 years from the grant date. Vesting periods may be set by
the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, but options outstanding under the Plan and prior plans are 25 percent vested after one year, 50 percent after two years, 75 percent after three years, and 100 percent after four years.

Stock appreciation rights were issued to former MacMillan Bloedel employees in connection
with the company’s acquisition of MacMillan Bloedel in 1999. In addition, stock appreciation rights are granted to certain international employees from time to time. As of December 25, 2005, 970,048 stock appreciation rights were
outstanding, with strike prices ranging from $39.41 per right to $65.69 per right. These stock appreciation rights are included in the stock option information presented below.

On April 13, 2004, the company instituted a program to purchase shares from a limited number of employees who had been limited in their
ability to sell shares issuable upon exercise of their stock options as a result of trading restrictions the company imposed on such employees. Under this program, the option holders were permitted to effect a cashless exercise of their stock
options followed by an immediate sale to the company of the common shares issued on such cashless exercise, so that there would be no market transaction in connection with such exercises. Only those options



granted to 21 participating employees on or prior to April 19, 1999, (representing options to purchase 578,486 common shares) were eligible to be
exercised under the program. The program resulted in variable accounting treatment for the stock options included in the program through the program’s expiration on April 1, 2005.

The company accounts for all options under APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations. A reconciliation in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share had the company applied the fair-value recognition provisions of Statement 123 to stock-based
compensation.

The company allows certain employees to defer all or a portion
of their bonus into company share equivalents, with a 15 percent premium applied if payment is delayed for at least five years. The deferred account increases or decreases based on the performance of the company’s stock plus dividends.

The compensation expense recognized for all of the incentive plans was $11
million in 2005, $9 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003.

Changes in the
number of options outstanding are summarized as follows:

The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants:



The following table summarizes information
about stock options outstanding at December 25, 2005 (shares in thousands):

NOTE 22. ACQUISITION

APM

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company acquired a 67 percent interest in Aracruz Produtos de Madeira S.A. (APM) for $17 million in cash. APM operates a sawmill in Brazil that produces
high-value eucalyptus lumber and related appearance wood products. The sawmill has an annual capacity of 23 million board feet.

NOTE 23. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Discontinued operations presented in the consolidated statement of earnings includes the following:

B.C. Coastal sale

In May 2005, the company sold its B.C. Coastal operations to Coastal Acquisition Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brascan Corporation of Toronto, Canada. The sale
included 635,000 acres (258,000 hectares) of private timberlands and the annual harvesting rights to 3.6 million cubic meters of timber subject to public timber leases. The sale also included five softwood sawmills, with a combined annual
production capacity of 690 million board feet, and two remanufacturing facilities. Prior to the sale, the company’s B.C. Coastal operations were included in both the Timberlands and Wood Products segments.

The company recognized a gain on the sale of $110 million, including a tax benefit of $46
million, in the second quarter of 2005 and recognized a pension curtailment charge of $1 million in the third quarter of 2005. The net pretax gain of $63 million is included in contribution to earnings of the Corporate and Other segment in 2005.

The income tax benefit recognized upon the sale of the B.C. Coastal
operations includes a deferred tax benefit of $185 million resulting from the rollout of temporary differences on the assets sold and a current tax expense of $139 million on the taxable gain. Current taxes reflect the benefit of favorable capital
gains treatment applicable to the sale of timberlands in Canada.



Sale of French Composites Operations

In December 2005, the company sold its French composite panels operations to Financiera Maderera S.A. (FINSA). The sale included two composite panel
manufacturing operations with a combined annual capacity of approximately 330 million square feet. Prior to the sale, the company’s French composite panels operations were included in the Corporate and Other segment.

The company recognized a net gain on the sale of $34 million, including a related tax
expense of $23 million, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The pretax gain of $57 million is included in contribution to earnings of the Corporate and Other segment in 2005.

NOTE 24. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 10, 2006, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company acquired Maracay Homes Arizona I, LLC, a privately-held homebuilder located in Phoenix, Arizona.

NOTE 25. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The company is principally engaged in the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture,
distribution and sale of forest products; and real estate development and construction. The company’s business segments are:

Ÿ

Timberlands, which includes logs, chips and timber.

Ÿ

Wood Products, which includes softwood lumber, plywood, veneer, composite panels, OSB, hardwood lumber, engineered lumber, raw materials and building materials distribution.

Ÿ

Cellulose Fiber and White Papers, which includes pulp, paper and liquid packaging board.

Ÿ

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling.

Ÿ

Real Estate and Related Assets.

Ÿ

Corporate and Other.

As disclosed in Note 23: Discontinued Operations, the company sold its B.C. Coastal operations in the second quarter of 2005 and sold its French composites operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. The segment data
below includes the activities of the B.C. Coastal operations in the Timberlands and Wood Products segments. The activities of the French composites operations are included in the Corporate and Other segment. The pretax gains of $63 million on the
B.C. Coastal sale and $57 million on the French composites sale are both included in the Corporate and Other segment in 2005.

The timber-based businesses involve a high degree of integration among timber operations; building materials conversion facilities; and pulp, paper, containerboard and
liquid packaging board primary manufacturing and secondary conversion facilities. This integration includes extensive transfers of raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products between and among these groups. The company’s accounting
policies for segments are the same as those described in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Management evaluates segment performance based on the contributions to earnings of the respective segments. Accounting for segment profitability in integrated manufacturing sites involves allocation of joint
conversion and common facility costs based upon the extent of usage by the respective product lines at that facility. Transfer of products between segments is accounted for at current market values.



An analysis and reconciliation of the
company’s business segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial statements is as follows:





NOTE 26. GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS

Selected information related to the company’s operations by geographical area is as follows:



NOTE 27. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL
INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

2005 and 2004 do not equal the sum of the respective earnings per share for the four quarters of 2005 and 2004 in all instances because of common share activity during the respective years.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

The company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the
company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on their evaluation, the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe the controls and procedures in place are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed complies with the SEC’s rules and forms.



Changes In Internal Controls

In the first quarter of 2005, the company began the first phase of implementation in a multi-year effort to upgrade the technology supporting the company’s financial
systems. As part of this effort, the following changes were made during the fourth quarter of 2005:

Ÿ

The company continued its conversion to a new general ledger system through the implementation of unit accounting functionality and financial reporting tools in additional
businesses and individual operating units.

Ÿ

The company completed the deployment of upgraded versions of the sales, product tracking and inventory/sales reporting systems in the fine paper business.

These implementations resulted in certain changes to business processes and internal
controls impacting financial reporting. In addition, certain accounting processes are being centralized in connection with the upgrade of the technology supporting the company’s financial systems. Management is taking the necessary steps to
monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls during this period of change. These steps include providing training related to business process changes and the new system software to individuals using the new systems to carry out their job
responsibilities as well as those who rely on the financial information. Additionally, oversight activities have increased during the transition period and a support organization has been established to monitor system operations, answer user
questions, resolve issues in a timely manner, and report trends to management.

No other changes occurred in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

OTHER INFORMATION

On October 4, 2005,
the company announced an indefinite closure of the pulp and paper mill in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The Prince Albert paper mill was permanently closed in January 2006. The Prince Albert pulp mill is being offered for sale and will continue
operating until spring 2006 to minimize risk of damage caused by cold winter weather. The Big River sawmill sells chips and hog fuel to the Prince Albert pulp mill and is not expected to have a market for such residuals if the Prince Albert pulp
mill were to close.

As disclosed in Form 8-K dated December 15, 2005,
the company estimated that the pretax charges required for the Prince Albert pulp and paper mill and the Big River sawmill would be $361 million to $367 million. In connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended
December 25, 2005, the company reassessed the probability of the sale of the pulp mill and concluded that additional charges of $100 million, including impairment charges of $71 million and termination benefits of $29 million, were required. As
a result, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the company recognized total pretax impairment charges of $429 million and total charges for termination benefits that will likely require future cash expenditures of approximately $38 million for the Prince
Albert pulp and paper mill and the Big River sawmill.
