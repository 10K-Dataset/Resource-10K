Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I

Item 1. Business

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of Washington
in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. It is principally engaged in
the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture, distribution and sale of
forest products; and real estate development and construction. Its
principal business
segments are timberlands; wood products; pulp and paper; containerboard,
packaging and recycling; and real estate and related assets. Throughout this
document, the term “company” refers to Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its
majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The term “Weyerhaeuser”
refers to the forest products-based operations and excludes the real estate and
related assets operations.

Information with respect to the description and general development of the
company’s business, included on pages 16 through 24 and 26 through 29,

Description of the Business of the Company

, contained in the company’s

Annual Report to Shareholders

, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial information with respect to industry segments and geographical areas,
included in Notes 22 and 23 of

Notes to Financial Statements

contained in the
company’s

2002 Annual Report to Shareholders

, is incorporated herein by
reference.

Timberlands

The company is engaged in the management of 7.2 million acres of company-owned
and .8 million acres of leased commercial forestland in North America, most of
it highly productive and located extremely well to serve both domestic and
international markets. The company also has renewable, long-term licenses on
34.7 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada
that are managed by our Canadian operations. The standing timber inventory on
these lands is approximately 509 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of
solid wood). The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of
end products that may be produced from timber varies according to the species,
size and quality of timber, and will change through time as the mix of these
variables changes. The end products are generally measured in board feet. To
sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the company is engaged in
extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and
commercial thinning, fertilization and operational pruning, all of which
increase the yield from its fee timberland acreage.

(1)

Includes approximately 24 million acres of productive forestland.

(2)

Includes Weyerhaeuser percentage ownership of timberlands owned and
managed through joint ventures.

Proceedings

Countervailing and Anti-dumping
Duties.

In April of 2001, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (Coalition) filed two
petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Department) and the
International Trade Commission (ITC), claiming that production of softwood
lumber in Canada was being subsidized by Canada and that imports from Canada
were being “dumped” into the U.S. market and sold at less than fair value. The
Coalition asked that countervailing duty (CVD) and anti-dumping tariffs be
imposed on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

In March 2002, the Department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain
Canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market
price for stumpage and established a final CVD rate of 18.79 percent. Because
the final determination eliminated the 90-day retroactive duties, Weyerhaeuser
reversed its $18 million accrual for the retroactive portion of the CVD during
the first quarter of 2002. The charge for the retroactive portion of the CVD
had been recognized during 2001.

In May 2002, the ITC confirmed its earlier ruling that U.S. industry is
threatened by subsidized and dumped imports. Its finding of only threat of
injury means that the CVD and anti-dumping duties will be collected only for
the period beginning with the publication of its final order on May 22, 2002.
In the anti-dumping portion of the case, the Department selected Weyerhaeuser
and five Canadian companies to provide data for the anti-dumping investigation.
In its preliminary ruling issued on October 30, 2001, the Department found that
Weyerhaeuser had engaged in dumping and set a preliminary “dumping margin” for
Weyerhaeuser. In the final determination, Weyerhaeuser’s depository rate was
set at 12.39 percent. With the finding by the ITC of only threat of injury, the
anti-dumping accrual of $29 million recorded in 2001 and $13 million recorded
in 2002 were reversed on Weyerhaeuser’s books during the second quarter.

Following is a summary of the CVD and anti-dumping amounts recorded in
Weyerhaeuser’s statement of earnings:

$


Approximately one year following the publication of the final order and
annually thereafter for a total of five years, the Department will conduct
reviews to determine whether Weyerhaeuser had engaged in dumping and whether
Canada continued to subsidize softwood logs and, if so, the dumping margin and
CVD to impose. At the end of five years, both the countervailing duty and
anti-dumping orders will be automatically reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to
determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy will continue or recur.

Weyerhaeuser is appealing under the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). Panels have been appointed and will review the imposition of the
anti-dumping duty and the CVD. With the support of provincial governments, the
federal government of Canada also moved for appellate review by panels under
the World Trade Organization (WTO).

In July 2002, the WTO issued two interim rulings against the United States. The
first ruling was against the so-called “Byrd Amendment,” which gives U.S. firms
cash from punitive trade sanctions applied on foreign imports. The appeals body
affirmed the ruling in January 2003. The second ruling was that a key measure
used in the CVD to determine the existence of a subsidy is improper; this is
viewed by the United States as having been made moot by a final determination
in the investigation.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

It is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on
Weyerhaeuser. In the event that the CVD and anti-dumping margins are determined
to be improper, the charges incurred for these duties may be reversed and
Weyerhaeuser could receive reimbursement for amounts paid to date. In the event
that final rates differ from the depository rates, ultimate charges may be
higher or lower than those recorded to date. Weyerhaeuser is unable to estimate
at this time the amount of additional charges or reversals that may be
necessary for this matter in the future.

Hardboard Siding Claims.

Weyerhaeuser announced in June 2000 it had entered
into a proposed nationwide settlement of its hardboard siding class action
cases and, as a result, took a pretax charge of $130 million to cover the
estimated cost of the settlement and related claims. The court approved the
settlement in December 2000. An appeal from the settlement was denied in March
2002 and is now binding on all parties. In the third quarter of 2001,
Weyerhaeuser reassessed the adequacy of the reserve and increased the reserve
by an additional $43 million. Weyerhaeuser incurred claims and related costs in
the amount of $11 million in 2002, $37 million in 2001 and $31 million in 2000
and charged these costs against the reserve. While the company believes that
the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate, the company is
unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges that may be
required for these matters in the future.

The settlement class consists of all persons who own or owned structures in the
United States on which Weyerhaeuser’s hardboard siding had been installed from
January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1999. This is a claims-based settlement,
which means that the claims will be paid as submitted over a nine-year period.
An independent adjuster will review each claim submitted and determine whether
it qualifies for payment under the terms of the settlement agreement. The
following table presents an analysis of the claims activity related to the
hardboard siding class action cases:



Number of claims filed during the period

The company negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of
certain costs related to these claims. As of December 29, 2002, Weyerhaeuser
has either received or accrued $52 million in recoveries from its insurance
carriers.

At the end of 2002, the company is a defendant in state trial court in nine
cases that are outside of the settlement involving primarily multi-family
structures and residential developments. The company anticipates that other
individuals and entities that have opted out of the settlement may file
lawsuits against the company. In January 2002, a jury returned a verdict in
favor of the company in a lawsuit involving hardboard siding manufactured by
Weyerhaeuser and installed by a developer in a residential development located
in Modesto, California. The verdict has been appealed and is not included in
the nine cases mentioned at the state court level.

Antitrust Litigation.

In May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed
against the company in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Both suits name as defendants several other major containerboard and packaging
producers. The complaint in the first case alleges the defendants conspired to
fix the price of linerboard and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of
increasing the price of corrugated containers. The suit requested class
certification for purchasers of corrugated containers during the period from
October 1993 through November 1995. The complaint in the second case alleges
that the company conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby
the price of corrugated sheets. The suit requested class certification for
purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period October 1993 through November
1995. Both suits seek damages, including treble damages, under the antitrust
laws. No specific damage amounts have been claimed. In September 2001, the
district court certified both classes. On appeal, the 3rd Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial court’s certification of the two classes. The
company and other defendants have sought certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court
to review the class certification issue. At the trial level, discussions have
begun on reactivating pretrial discovery efforts. Trial has been set for April
2004.

In December 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the company in U.S. District
Court in Oregon alleging that from 1996 to present Weyerhaeuser had monopoly
power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the Pacific Northwest market for
alder logs and finished alder lumber. In August 2001, the complaint was amended
to add an additional plaintiff. The plaintiffs have requested relief, including
treble damages, of $110 million. In October 2002, the company filed motions
for summary judgment on several issues. In January 2003, the court denied the
company’s motions. Trial is scheduled for April 8, 2003.

Paragon Trade Brands, Inc., Litigation.

In May 1999, the Equity Committee
(Committee) in the Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. (Paragon) bankruptcy proceeding
filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia
for authority to prosecute claims against the company in the name of the
debtor’s estate. Specifically, the Committee asserted that the company breached
certain warranties in agreements entered into between Paragon and the company
in connection with Paragon’s public offering of common stock in January 1993.
The Committee seeks to recover damages sustained by Paragon as a result of two
patent infringement cases, one brought by Procter & Gamble and the other by
Kimberly-Clark. In September 1999, the court authorized the Committee to
commence an adversary proceeding against the company. The Committee commenced
this proceeding in October 1999, seeking damages in excess of $420 million
against the company. Pursuant to a reorganization of Paragon, the litigation
claims representative for the bankruptcy estate became the plaintiff in the
proceeding. On June 26, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court issued an oral opinion
granting the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment, holding
Weyerhaeuser liable to plaintiff for breaches of warranty and denying the
company’s motion for summary judgment. On October 30, 2002, the Bankruptcy
Court issued a written order confirming the June oral opinion. In November
2002, the company filed motion for reconsideration with the Bankruptcy Court.
The court has not ruled on the company’s motion. No trial date has been set
for the determination of the damages. Weyerhaeuser disagrees with the
Bankruptcy Court’s decision and will diligently pursue all available relief.

Other Litigation.

The company is a party to other matters generally incidental
to its business in addition to the matters described above.

Summary.

Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a
great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, the
company’s management presently believes that resolving all of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position,
liquidity or its results of operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

–

continued

Environmental Matters

In April 1999, Willamette’s Johnsonburg, Penn., paper and pulp mill received a
notice of violation (NOV) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Management has met with
federal and state officials to resolve the matters alleged in the NOV and will
continue to work with officials to narrow issues in dispute. Management
believes that it is reasonably possible that a settlement will be reached at a
future date, that may involve payment of a penalty of up to approximately $1
million and the installation of pollution control equipment.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of
hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as “Superfund,” and similar
state laws. The EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the company
that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous
waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the
company. The company has established reserves for remediation costs on all of
the approximately 79 active sites across its operations as of the end of 2002
totaling $54 million, up from $45 million at the end of 2001. This increase
reflects the incorporation of new information on all sites concerning
remediation alternatives, updates on prior cost estimates and new sites, less
the costs incurred to remediate these sites during this period. The company
accrued remediation costs of $18 million in 2002 and $34 million in 2000. In
2001, the company reduced the accruals by $8 million. The company incurred
remediation costs of $9 million in 2002, $14 million in 2001 and $12 million in
2000, and charged these costs against the reserve. Based on currently available
information and analysis, the company believes that it is reasonably possible
that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current accruals by
amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range, in the aggregate, up
to approximately $100 million over several years. This estimate of the upper
end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain
than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based, and utilizes
assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of reasonably
possible outcomes. In estimating both its current accruals for environmental
remediation and the possible range of additional future costs, the company has
assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to
the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who may be jointly
and severally liable. The ability of other potentially responsible parties to
participate has been taken into account, based generally on each party’s
financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis. No amounts
have been recorded for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.

Forward-Looking Statements

This document, including exhibits incorporated by
reference, contains statements concerning the company’s future
results and performance that are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use
of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,”
“will,” “expects,” “may,” “should,”
“approximately,” “anticipates,”
“indicates,” “plans” and “estimates”
and the negative or other variations of those terms with comparable
terminology or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. In
particular, some of these forward-looking statements deal with
expected synergies from the Willamette acquisition, expected effects
of domestic and foreign government environmental regulations, First
Nation claims, projected capital expenditures, environmental
remediation expenditures, certification of forestry practices, future
performance of the company’s business segments, future pension
income, pension contributions, health care plans, the effect of
pending litigation on the company’s financial position,
liquidity or results of operations, sale of approximately 100,000
acres of western Washington timberlands, closure of facilities, debt
reduction and future debt-to-capital ratios, future commitments under
operating leases, and similar matters. The accuracy of such
statements is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected, including, but not limited to, the effect of general
economic conditions, including the level of interest rates and
housing starts; market demand for the company’s products, which
may be tied to the relative strength of various U.S. business
segments; performance of the company’s manufacturing operations;
the successful execution of internal performance plans; the level of
competition from domestic and foreign producers; the effect of
forestry,

land use, environmental and other governmental regulations;
fires, floods and other natural disasters; the company’s ability
to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and to
realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from these acquisitions; the
ability of acquired businesses to perform in accordance with the
company’s expectations; legal proceedings; and uncertainties
affecting insurance recoveries. The company is also a large exporter
and is affected by changes in economic activity in Europe and Asia,
particularly Japan; changes in currency exchange rates, particularly
the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the
Canadian dollar; and restrictions on international trade or tariffs
imposed on imports, including the countervailing and anti-dumping
duties imposed on the company’s softwood lumber shipments from
Canada to the United States. These and other factors could cause
or contribute to actual results differing materially from such
forward-looking statements.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Company:

Under date of February 12, 2003, we reported on the consolidated balance sheet
of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and shareholders’

this annual report on Form 10-K. In connection with our audit of the
aforementioned financial statements, we also audited the related financial
statement schedule in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2002.
This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial
statement schedule based on our audit.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth herein.

The consolidated financial statements of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries
as of December 30, 2001, and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 30, 2001,
were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note
4 to the consolidated financial statements, those financial statements have
been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,

which was adopted by the company as of December 31, 2001. Further, as
described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the company
changed the composition of its reportable segments in 2002, and the amounts in
the 2001 and 2000 financial statements relating to the reportable segments have
been restated to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable segments. We
audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for
reportable segments reflected in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements. In
our opinion, the 2001 and 2000 disclosure in Note 22 to the consolidated
financial statements is appropriate and the 2001 and 2000 adjustments to Note 4
to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate and have been properly
applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures
to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the company other than with
respect to such disclosures and adjustments, and accordingly, we do not express
an opinion or any form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 financial statements
taken as a whole.

United States, the financial statements included in Weyerhaeuser Company’s

material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
