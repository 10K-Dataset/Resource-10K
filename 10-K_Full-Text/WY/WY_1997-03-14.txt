Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I




- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser  Company (the company) was incorporated in the  state  of
Washington  in  January 1900, as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.   It  is
principally  engaged  in  growing and harvesting  of  timber  and  the
manufacture,  distribution and sale of forest  products,  real  estate
development  and construction, and financial services.  Its  principal
business  segments include timberlands and wood products; pulp,  paper
and packaging; real estate; and financial services.

Information with respect to the description and general development of
the  company's business, included on pages 42 through 47,  Description
of the Business of the Company, contained in the company's 1996 Annual
Report to Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial  information with respect to industry segments, included  in
Note  18  of Notes to Financial Statements contained in the  company's
1996  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  is  incorporated  herein   by
reference.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The  company  owns  approximately  5.3  million  acres  of  commercial
forestland  in  the United States (61% in the South  and  39%  in  the
Pacific   Northwest),   most  of  it  highly  productive  and  located
extremely well to serve both domestic and international markets.   The
company  has, additionally, long-term license arrangements  in  Canada
covering  approximately 22.9 million acres (of which 15 million  acres
are considered  to  be productive forestland).  The  combined  total
timber  inventory  on these U.S. and Canadian lands  is  approximately
266 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which
approximately 75% is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber  varies according to the species, size and quality  of  timber,
and will  change through time as the mix of these variables  changes.
To  sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the company is
engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species,
precommercial  and commercial thinning, fertilization and  operational
pruning,  all  of  which increase the yield from  its  fee  timberland
acreage.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Trial  began in May 1992 in a federal income tax refund case that  the
company  filed  in July 1989 in the United States Claims  Court.   The
complaint  seeks  a refund of federal income taxes  that  the  company
contends  it  overpaid in 1977 through 1983.  The alleged overpayments
are  the result of the disallowance of certain timber casualty  losses
and  certain  deductions claimed by the company  arising  from  export
transactions.   The refund sought was approximately $29 million,  plus
statutory  interest from the dates of the alleged  overpayments.   The
company   settled  the  portion  of  the  case  relating   to   export
transactions  and received a tax refund of approximately $10  million,
plus  statutory interest.  In September 1994, the United States  Court
of  Federal Claims issued an opinion on the casualty loss issues which
will result   in  the  allowance  of  additional  tax   refunds   of
approximately $2 million, plus statutory interest.  Both  the  company
and  the  government appealed the decision.  On August  2,  1996,  the
Court  of  Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its opinion  on  the
remaining timber casualty loss issues, ruling in favor of the  company
on  both the company's appeal and the government's appeal.  The United
States Supreme Court denied the government's request for certiorari on
January 21, 1997.

On  March 6, 1992, the company filed a complaint in the Superior Court
for  King County, Washington, against a number of insurance companies.
The   complaint  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  insurance
companies  named  as  defendants are obligated  under  the  terms  and
conditions  of the policies sold by them to the company to defend  the
company  and to pay, on the company's behalf, certain claims  asserted
against  the  company.   The  claims relate to  alleged  environmental
damage  to third-party sites and to some of the company's own property
to  which allegedly toxic material was delivered or on which allegedly
toxic  material  was  placed in the past.  Since  December  1992,  the
company  has agreed to settlements with all but one of the defendants.
The remaining defendant provided first layer excess coverage during  a
three  year period.  That defendant's liability on groups of sites  is
being  tried  in phases.  Two trials against the remaining  defendant,
affecting  nine  sites, began in October 1994 and  February  1996  and
resulted in verdicts assigning 100 percent clean-up responsibility  to
the  defendant on three sites, partial responsibility on three  others
and  a  finding of no liability as to the remaining three.  The  trial
court has ruled that the primary policy has been exhausted and imposed
an  obligation on the remaining defendant to provide a defense on  one
of  the  sites, a ruling that may be expanded to include other  sites.
After voluntary dismissal on 6 sites, trial for the remaining 10 sites
has been set for June 1997.

The  company  received  from  the Lane  County,  Oregon  Regional  Air
Pollution Control Authority (LRAPA) a draft Notice of Violation  which
seeks  penalties  for alleged Prevention of Significant  Deterioration
(PSD)  violations at the company's Springfield, Oregon,  particleboard
operations.  LRAPA  informed the company in July 1995  that  it  will
withdraw  its draft Notice of Violation (NOV) and will not seek  fines
or  penalties.  On September 15, 1995, however, LRAPA issued a revised
draft  NOV (the Revised Draft NOV), which alleged that the Springfield
particleboard facility had violated a condition of its Air Contaminant
Discharge Permit.  The allegations in the Revised Draft NOV are  based
upon  the  same facts and circumstances relied upon by  LRAPA  in  the
prior  draft NOV.  The company has contested LRAPA's issuance  of  the
Revised  Draft  NOV.  On June 8, 1996, the company and  LRAPA  entered
into  a  Stipulated Final Order (SFO) to resolve all past and  ongoing
alleged   PSD   issues,  contested  matters  and  alleged violations
associated  with  extended  hours  of  operation  at  the  Springfield
particleboard facility.  In exchange for a full resolution of all past
and ongoing contested matters, the company agreed to pay a total civil
penalty of $19.5 thousand, of which $7.5 thousand was paid directly to
LRAPA.   The remaining $12 thousand civil penalty was suspended.  The
company  also agreed to implement a Supplemental Environmental Project
(SEP)  consisting  of  the funding of the preparation  of  a  nitrogen
oxides  (Nox)  emission  inventory  for  Lane  County.   The  emission
inventory will be conducted by an outside environmental consultant  at
a cost not to exceed $40 thousand.

The  company  conducted  a  review of its  10  major  pulp  and  paper
facilities  to  evaluate the facilities' compliance with  federal  PSD
regulations.  The results of the reviews were disclosed to seven state
agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during 1994 and
1995.  At the Cosmopolis, Washington, Columbus, Mississippi, and Flint
River, Georgia, facilities, the state regulatory agencies agreed  with
the  company's conclusions regarding the status of each facility.  For
the  Cosmopolis facility, the Washington Department of Ecology  agreed
the  changes made at the facility did not require PSD review.  For the
Columbus and Flint River facilities, the states concluded the original
PSD  permits  issued to the facilities require updating.  The  company
will update emissions data for the Columbus and Flint River facilities
as part of the Title V permitting process.  No penalties were assessed
for  the  issues  identified at Columbus and Flint River.  Agreements
resolving the alleged PSD issues have been reached with the states  of
Washington,  Oklahoma and North Carolina, as noted below.  No  issues
were identified at the company's Rothschild, Wisconsin, facility.  In
April  1995,  EPA Region X issued a NOV to the company  and  to  North
Pacific  Paper  Corporation (NORPAC), a joint  venture  in  which  the
company  has  an  80  percent ownership interest.  The  NOV  addresses
alleged  PSD  violations at NORPAC's Longview,  Washington,  newsprint
manufacturing facility.  A settlement resolving alleged PSD issues  at
the  Longview/NORPAC complex was reached with the State of  Washington
on January 26, 1996.  On November 14, 1995, the company entered into a
settlement  with  the  State  of  Oklahoma  to  resolve  alleged PSD
violations   at   the  company's  Valliant,  Oklahoma,  containerboard
manufacturing facility.  The company also entered into Special  Orders
by  Consent  with the State of North Carolina to resolve  alleged  PSD
issues  at  the New Bern, North Carolina, pulp mill and the  Plymouth,
North Carolina, pulp and paper complex.  No decision has been made  by
the  LRAPA  concerning  alleged  PSD  and  permit  violations  at  the
company's Springfield, Oregon, containerboard manufacturing facility.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings - Continued
- --------------------------------------

The  Washington  Department  of Ecology  investigated  the  accidental
release of chorine, chlorine dioxide and noncondensable gasses in July
1994 at the company's pulp mill in Longview, and issued a $10 thousand
penalty  for  the chlorine release and a $5 thousand penalty  for  the
noncondensable gasses release which have been paid by the company.  In
June 1995, EPA issued an Administrative Complaint against the company,
seeking  penalties of $225 thousand and alleging a failure  to  timely
report  the  chlorine  release.  The company  settled  the  matter  on
January  21,  1997, agreeing to pay a penalty of $68 thousand  and  to
perform   supplemental  environmental  projects  in  the   amount of
$110  thousand.  On September 25, 1996, the company learned  that  the
EPA   has  commenced  a  preliminary  criminal  investigation  of  the
incident, and in late November learned that the investigation had been
discontinued.

The Washington Department of Ecology issued a $10 thousand penalty  to
the  company  because  of  three accidental  chlorine  releases  which
occurred  at  the company's pulp mill in Longview on March  18,  1996,
which has been paid.  The EPA is also investigating.

The  Washington Department of Ecology has issued a notice of violation
because of an accidental spill of an estimated 8,700 gallons of  crude
sulfate  turpentine  on January 27, 1997, at the  company's  pulp  and
paper operations in Longview.  The EPA is also investigating.

On  April  9,  1993, the company entered into a SFO  with  the  Oregon
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) for alleged air emissions in
excess  of permit levels and PSD noncompliance at the company's  North
Bend,   Oregon,  containerboard  facility.   The  SFO  established   a
compliance schedule for installing control technology.  A Supplemental
SFO  assessed  a  $247 thousand initial penalty and  a  $500  per  day
stipulated penalty until compliance was demonstrated.  On November 15,
1995,  DEQ  issued a letter, indicating that the company had satisfied
the  requirements  of  the  SFO  and  Supplemental  SFO.   No  further
penalties were assessed against the company.  Termination of  the  SFO
will  occur after issuance of the federal air operating permit to  the
North  Bend  containerboard facility.  The North  Bend  containerboard
facility received its federal air operating permit on July 1, 1996.

On June 20, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)
issued  a NOV for alleged air violations at the Marshfield, Wisconsin,
wood products manufacturing facility.  No penalty was assessed in  the
NOV.   Since  the  WDNR  lacks an administrative mechanism  to  assess
penalties for alleged regulatory non-compliance, it referred  the  NOV
to  the  Wisconsin  Department of Justice for  enforcement  action  on
July  2,  1996.  The Wisconsin Department of Justice has accepted  the
referral.

On  October  2, 1996, the WDNR conducted an inspection of  a  building
demolition  project  at the company's Marshfield, Wisconsin  facility.
The  WDNR  noted several potential non-compliance issues in  the  work
performed  by  the asbestos abatement subcontractor retained  for  the
project.   Upon learning of the issues observed by WDNR,  the  company
removed the asbestos abatement subcontractor from the plantsite.  The
WDNR  and  EPA Region V are reviewing the work performed  to  evaluate
whether  an enforcement action should be brought against the  asbestos
abatement subcontractor, the general contractor, and/or the company.

On  November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company  in  the
Circuit  Court  for  the  First Judicial  District  of  Hinds  County,
Mississippi,  on  behalf  of a purported class  of  riparian  property
owners in Mississippi and Alabama whose properties are located on  the
Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar  Creek  and  the
Magoway  Creek.   The complaint seeks $1 billion in  compensatory  and
punitive  damages for diminution in property value, personal  injuries
and mental anguish allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous  substances, including dioxins and furans, by the  company's
pulp  and  paper  mill  in  Columbus,  Mississippi,  and  the  alleged
fraudulent  concealments of such discharge.  The complaint also  seeks
an injunction prohibiting future releases and the removal of hazardous
substances  allegedly released in the past.  On  August  20,  1993,  a
companion action was filed in Greene County, Alabama, on behalf  of  a
similar  purported class of riparian owners with essentially the  same
claims  as the Mississippi case.  By order dated April 5, 1995,  venue
of  the Alabama action was transferred to Sumter County, Alabama.   On
January 20, 1995, the court in the Alabama action certified a class of
all  persons  who, as of the date the action commenced, were  riparian
owners,  lessees and licensees of properties located on the  Tennessee
Tombigbee  Waterway in Greene, Sumter, Pickens and  Marengo  counties,
Alabama,  and Lowndes and Noxubee counties, Mississippi, to  determine
whether  the  company  is  liable to the  members  of  the  class  for
compensatory  and/or punitive damages and to determine the  amount  of
punitive  damages, if any, to be awarded to the class as a whole.   By
order dated April 12, 1995, as orally amended on February 1, 1996, the
geographical  boundaries of the class were amended to run  from  below
the  Columbus  mill's  wastewater discharge pipe  to  just  above  the
confluence  of  the  Black Warrior River and the  Tennessee  Tombigbee
Waterway.  The class is estimated to range from approximately 1,000 to
1,500 members.    In late July, 1996, the company reached an agreement
to  settle  both  the  Mississippi action and the Alabama  action  for
$2.5  million.  The agreement is subject to the approval of the  court
in the Alabama action.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings - Continued
- --------------------------------------

In  November 1996, an action was filed against the company in Superior
Court  for King County, Washington, on behalf of a purported class  of
all individuals and entities that own property in the United States on
which  exterior hardboard siding manufactured by the company has  been
installed since 1980.  The action alleges the company has manufactured
and  distributed  defective hardboard siding and has breached  express
warranties  and consumer protection statutes in its sale of  hardboard
siding.   The action seeks compensatory damages, including prejudgment
interest, and seeks damages for the cost of replacing siding that rots
subsequent to the entry of any judgment.  In January 1997,  an  action
was  filed,  also  in Superior Court for King County,  Washington,  on
behalf  of  a  purported  class  of all individuals,  proprietorships,
partnerships, corporations, and other business entities in the  United
States on whose homes, condominiums, apartment complexes or commercial
buildings  hardboard  siding manufactured  by  the  company  has  been
installed.   The action alleges the company has breached  express  and
implied  warranties  in  its sale of hardboard  siding  and  also  has
violated the Consumer Protection Act of the State of Washington.   The
action  seeks  damages,  prejudgment interest,  costs  and  reasonable
attorney  fees.   The company is a defendant in approximately  fifteen
other  hardboard siding cases, one of which purports  to  be  a  class
action  on  behalf of purchasers of single- or multi-family residences
in Nebraska that contain the company's hardboard siding.

The  company  is also a party to various proceedings relating  to  the
clean-up   of   hazardous   waste  sites   under   the   Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly  known
as  "Superfund," and similar state laws.  The EPA and/or various state
agencies  have  notified  the company that it  may  be  a  potentially
responsible  party with respect to other hazardous waste sites  as  to
which  no  proceedings have been instituted against the company.   The
company   is  also  a  party  to  other  legal  proceedings  generally
incidental to its business.  Although the final outcome of  any  legal
proceeding  is  subject  to  a  great many  variables  and  cannot  be
predicted with any degree of certainty, the company presently believes
that  any  ultimate  outcome  resulting  from  the  legal  proceedings
discussed  herein, or all of them combined, would not have a  material
effect  on  the  company's current financial  position,  liquidity  or
results  of operations; however, in any given future reporting period,
such  legal  proceedings could have a material effect  on  results  of
operations.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
and Results of Operations
- -------------------------

On February 24, 1997, the company announced that it expects to take an
after-tax charge of approximately $25 million, or 12 cents per  common
share,  against earnings in the 1997 first quarter.  This charge  will
reflect  the impact of closure, consolidation or disposal of recycling
facilities; the permanent closure of its corrugated medium machine  at
Longview,   Washington;  the  anticipated  sale  of  its  wholly-owned
subsidiary, Shemin Nurseries, Inc., a wholesale nursery business based
in  Danbury,  Connecticut;  and interest  income  from  the  favorable
federal  income  tax decision relating to casualty  losses  associated
with the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

The  company  also  expects  to close the  sale  of  its  wholly-owned
subsidiary,  Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company, in the second  quarter  of
1997,  although  it  is  subject  to regulatory  approvals  and  other
contingencies.   If this transaction closes as presently  anticipated,
the  company  expects  it  to  have a  material  favorable  effect  on
operating results and cash flow in the quarter in which it closes.

Additional  information  with respect to Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  included on pages 1, 8-9, 12-13, 18-19, 24-25, 28-29,  34-35

Report  of  Independent  Public  Accountants  on  Financial  Statement
Schedules

To Weyerhaeuser Company:

We  have  audited  in  accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards,   the  financial  statements  included  in   Weyerhaeuser
Company's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 6,
1997.   Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
those  statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed on page  15
is  the  responsibility of the company's management and is presented
for   purposes  of  complying  with  the  Securities  and   Exchange
Commission's   rules  and  is  not  part  of  the  basic   financial
statements.   This  schedule  has been subjected  to  the  auditing
procedures  applied  in the audit of the basic financial  statements
and,  in  our  opinion, fairly states in all material  respects  the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation  to  the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.
