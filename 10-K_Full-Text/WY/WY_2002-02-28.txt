Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I

Item 1. Business

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of Washington
in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. It is principally engaged in
the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and sale
of forest products, real estate development and construction, and other real
estate related activities. Its business segments are timberlands; wood
products; pulp, paper and packaging; and real estate and related assets.

Information with respect to the description and general development of the
company’s business, included on pages 18 through 24 and 26 through 30,

Description of the Business of the Company

, contained in the company’s

2001 Annual Report to Shareholders

, is incorporated herein by

Timberlands

The company is engaged in the management of 5.9 million acres of company-owned
and .5 million acres of leased commercial forestland in North America, most of
it highly productive and located extremely well to serve both domestic and
international markets. The company also has renewable, long-term licenses on
32.6 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada
that are managed by our Canadian operations. The standing timber inventory on
these lands is approximately 400 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of
solid wood). The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of
end products that may be produced from timber varies according to the species,
size and quality of timber, and will change through time as the mix of these
variables changes. To sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the
company is engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable
species, precommercial and commercial thinning, fertilization and operational
pruning, all of which increase the yield from its fee timberland acreage.

(1)

Includes approximately 23 million acres of productive forestland.

(2)

Includes Weyerhaeuser percentage ownership of timberlands owned and managed
through joint ventures.

Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The company entered into a class action settlement of hardboard siding claims
against the company that was approved by the Superior Court, San Francisco
County, California, in December 2000. The settlement class consists of all
persons who own or owned structures in the United States on which the company’s
hardboard siding had been installed from January 1, 1981 through December 31,
1999. In February 2001, two named intervenors and objectors filed a notice of
appeal from the order granting final approval to the class action settlement.
The company has established reserves to cover the estimated cost of the
settlement and related costs. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2001, the
company is a defendant in 14 cases involving primarily multi-family structures
and residential developments. The company anticipates that other individuals
and entities that have opted out of the settlement may file lawsuits against the
company. In January 2002, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the company in
a lawsuit involving hardboard siding manufactured by the company and installed
by a developer in a residential development located in Modesto, California.

In May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the company in U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Both suits name as defendants
several other major containerboard and packaging producers. The complaint in
the first case alleges the defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard
and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of
corrugated containers. The suit purports to be a class action on behalf of
purchasers of corrugated containers during the period October 1993 through
November 1995. The complaint in the second case alleges that the company
conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price of
corrugated sheets. The suit purports to be a class action on behalf of
purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period October 1993 through November
1995. Both suits seek damages, including treble damages, under the antitrust
laws. In October 2000, the court denied motions to dismiss the suits that had
been filed by the company and the other defendants. The company and other
defendants have appealed the class certification decision to the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals.

In May 1999, the Equity Committee (the Committee) in the Paragon Trade Brands,
Inc. bankruptcy proceeding filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Georgia for authority to prosecute claims against the
company in the name of the debtor’s estate. Specifically, the Committee seeks to
assert that the company breached certain warranties in agreements entered into
between Paragon and the company in connection with Paragon’s public offering of
common stock in January 1993. The Committee seeks to recover damages sustained
by Paragon as a result of two patent infringement cases, one brought by Procter
& Gamble and the other by Kimberly-Clark. In September 1999, the court
authorized the Committee to commence an adversary proceeding against the
company. The Committee commenced this proceeding in October 1999, seeking
damages in excess of $420 million against the company. Both the Committee and
the company have filed motions for summary judgment, which are pending.

Following the expiration of a five-year agreement between the United States and
Canada, on April 2, 2001, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (Coalition)
filed a petition with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Department) and the
International Trade Commission (ITC), claiming that imports of softwood lumber
from Canada were being subsidized by Canada and were being “dumped” into the
U.S. market (sold at less than fair value). The Coalition asked that
countervailing duty (CVD) and antidumping tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber
imported from Canada. In August 2001, the Department issued a preliminary
finding that certain Canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by collecting
below-market stumpage payments and declared a preliminary CVD rate of 19.3
percent retroactive to May 18, 2001. The preliminary CVD expired on December
15, 2001. The company has accrued for the estimated cost of the CVD. The
Department also requested that Weyerhaeuser and five other Canadian companies
provide data for the antidumping investigation. In its preliminary ruling
issued on October 30, 2001, the Department found that the company had engaged
in dumping and set a preliminary “dumping margin” for the company of 11.93
percent. The company intends to contest the Department’s finding that it has
engaged in dumping but will now post a bond or cash to cover the estimated
amount for the duties that would be collected in the event it is finally
determined that dumping did occur. As of December 30, 2001, the company had
accrued $50 million based on the preliminary CVD rate and antidumping margin. A
final ruling on both the CVD and antidumping cases, which is expected during the
second quarter of 2002, will contain the determination of whether to make the
CVD and antidumping duties final and, if so, at what levels. The Department
would then conduct periodic reviews over the following five years to determine
whether the company had engaged in dumping and whether Canada continued to
subsidize softwood logs and, if

so, the dumping margin and CVD to impose. At the end of five years, both the
countervailing duty and antidumping orders would be automatically reviewed in a
“sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy
would
be likely to continue or recur. The company believes that the controversy has
created some volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace but has not had a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. There can be no
assurance, however, that if a permanent CVD or antidumping duty is imposed, it
will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations
in the future.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of
hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as “Superfund,” and similar
state laws. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or various state
agencies have notified the company that it may be a potentially responsible
party with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings
have been instituted against the company. The company is also a party to other
legal proceedings generally incidental to its business. Although the final
outcome of any legal proceeding or environmental matter is subject to a great
many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, the
company presently believes that any ultimate outcome resulting from these
proceedings and matters, or all of them combined, would not have a material
effect on the company’s current financial position, liquidity or results of
operations; however, in any given future reporting period, such proceedings or
matters could have a material effect on results of operations.

Report of Independent Public Accountants on Financial Statement Schedules

To Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States, the financial statements included in Weyerhaeuser
Company’s annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this
Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 11, 2002. Our
audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements
taken as a whole. The schedule shown on page 19 is the responsibility of
the company’s management and is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in
our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole.
