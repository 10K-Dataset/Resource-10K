Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of Washington
in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.  It is principally engaged in
the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and sale
of forest products, real estate development and construction, and other real
estate related activities.  Its business segments are timberlands; wood
products; pulp, paper and packaging; and real estate and related assets.

Information with respect to the description and general development of the
company's business, included on pages 40 through 44, Description of the Business
of the Company, contained in the company's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders,
is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial information with respect to industry segments and geographical areas,
included in Notes 19 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements contained in the
company's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders, is incorporated herein by
reference.

Timberlands

The company is engaged in the management of 5.9 million acres of company-owned
and .5 million acres of leased commercial forestland in North America, most of
it highly productive and located extremely well to serve both domestic and
international markets.  The company also has renewable, long-term licenses on
31.6 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada
that are managed by our Canadian operations.  The standing timber inventory on
these lands is approximately 588 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of
solid wood).  The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of end
products that may be produced from timber varies according to the species, size
and quality of timber, and will change through time as the mix of these
variables changes.  To sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the
company is engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable
species, precommercial and commercial thinning, fertilization and operational
pruning, all of which increase the yield from its fee timberland acreage.



- -------------------------------------------
(1) Includes approximately 20 million acres of productive forestland.

(2) Reflects Weyerhaeuser ownership only, excluding timberlands owned and
managed through joint ventures.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

The company conducted a review of its 10 major pulp and paper facilities to
evaluate the facilities' compliance with federal Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) regulations.  The results of the reviews were disclosed to
seven state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during 1994
and 1995.  All PSD compliance issues identified in the review have been
resolved. This includes PSD issues at the company's Springfield, Oregon,
containerboard facility which were resolved in December 2000, at which time a
Title V permit was issued for the facility.

The company has entered into a proposed class action settlement of hardboard
siding claims against the company. The settlement class consists of all persons
who own or owned structures in the United States on which the company's
hardboard siding has been installed from January 1, 1981 through December
31,1999. The settlement was approved by the Superior Court, San Francisco
County, California in December 2000.  On February 8, 2001, two named intervenors
and objectors filed a notice of appeal from the order granting final approval to
the class action settlement and an order awarding class counsel attorney fees.
They also appealed from two orders of December 13, 2000, one of which denied
their motion to intervene and the second related to the presentation of
witnesses at the final fairness hearing.  The company took an after-tax charge
of $82 million in the second quarter to cover the estimated cost of the
settlement and related costs. Because the nationwide class action settlement has
been approved, the company expects that two cases in which class actions have
been claimed but not certified in Oregon and Texas will be dismissed.  A similar
case in Washington was dismissed with prejudice on March 2, 2001.  Cases pending
in South Carolina and Iowa in which statewide classes have been sought but not
certified may proceed as individual cases but will not be able to be certified
as class actions on behalf of any claimants included in the certified nationwide
class. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company also was a defendant in 17
non-class hardboard siding cases involving primarily multi-family structures and
residential developments.

In May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the company in U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Both suits name as defendants
several other major containerboard and packaging producers.  The complaint in
the first case alleges the defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard
and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of
corrugated containers.  The suit purports to be a class action on behalf of
purchasers of corrugated containers during the period October 1993 through
November 1995.  The complaint in the second case alleges that the company
conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price of
corrugated sheets.  The suit purports to be a class action on behalf of
purchasers of corrugated sheets during the period October 1993 through November
1995. Both suits seek damages, including treble damages, under the antitrust
laws. In October 2000, the court denied motions to dismiss that had been filed
by the company and the other defendants.  Discovery has commenced in both suits
and the plaintiffs have filed motions to certify a class in both cases.

In May 1999, the Equity Committee ("the Committee") in the Paragon Trade Brands,
Inc. bankruptcy proceeding filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Georgia for authority to prosecute claims against the
company in the name of the debtor's estate.  Specifically, the Committee seeks
to assert that the company breached certain warranties in agreements entered
into between Paragon and the company in connection with Paragon's public
offering of common stock in January 1993.  The Committee seeks to recover
damages sustained by Paragon as a result of two patent infringement cases,
one brought by Procter & Gamble and the other by Kimberly-Clark.  In September
1999, the court authorized the Committee to commence an adversary proceeding
against the company.  The Committee commenced this proceeding in October 1999,
seeking damages in excess of $420 million against the company.

In April 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (Region X) (EPA) issued a
notice of violation (NOV) and proposed penalty of $194 thousand to the company's
Mountain Pine, Arkansas, manufacturing facility.  The NOV alleges the facility
was in violation of its Title V operating permit because it had reported
multiple instances in which the mill's two boilers had exceeded pressure drop
and scrubber flow rate requirements in its permits. The company has appealed the
proposed penalty.  Settlement negotiations have been completed and the final
documents are being drafted.  The total monetary penalty assessed against the
facility will be $40,000.  In addition, the facility will upgrade the
particulate controls on the boiler as a supplemental environmental project.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings-Continued
- ------------------------------------

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of
hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as "Superfund," and similar state
laws.  The EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the company that it
may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous waste
sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the company.  The
company is also a party to other legal proceedings generally incidental to its
business.  Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding or environmental
matter is subject to a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any
degree of certainty, the company presently believes that any ultimate outcome
resulting from these proceedings and matters, or all of them combined, would
not have a material effect on the company's current financial position,
liquidity or results of operations; however, in any given future reporting
period, such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on results of
operations.

Report of Independent Public Accountants on Financial Statement Schedules

To Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, the financial statements included in Weyerhaeuser Company's
annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and
have issued our report thereon dated February 7, 2001.  Our audit was made for
the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The
schedule shown on page 19 is the responsibility of the company's management and
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
