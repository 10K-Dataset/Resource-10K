Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------


Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of
Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.  It is
principally engaged in the growing and harvesting of timber and the
manufacture, distribution and sale of forest products, real estate
development and construction, and other real estate related
activities.  Its business segments are timberlands; wood products;
pulp, paper and packaging; and real estate and related assets.

Information with respect to the description and general development of
the company's business, included on pages 42 through 46, Description
of the Business of the Company, contained in the company's 1999 Annual
Report to Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial information with respect to industry segments and
geographical areas, included in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Financial
Statements contained in the company's 1999 Annual Report to
Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Timberlands

The company is engaged in the management of 5.9 million acres of
company-owned and .5 million acres of leased commercial forestland in
the United States and British Columbia, most of it highly productive
and located extremely well to serve both domestic and international
markets.  The standing timber inventory on these lands is
approximately 96 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid
wood).  The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of
end products that may be produced from timber varies according to the
species, size and quality of timber, and will change through time as
the mix of these variables changes.  To sustain the timber supply from
its fee timberlands, the company is engaged in extensive planting,
suppression of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and commercial
thinning, fertilization and operational pruning, all of which increase
the yield from its fee timberland acreage.










Wood Products

The company's wood products businesses produce and sell softwood
lumber, plywood and veneer; oriented strand board, composite and other
panels; hardwood lumber; doors and treated products.  These products
are sold primarily through the company's own sales organizations.
Building materials are sold to wholesalers, retailers and industrial
users.  The raw materials required to produce these products are
purchased from third parties, transferred at market price from the
company's timberlands, or obtained from long-term licensing
arrangements.

Sales volumes by major product are as follows (millions):

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

The company conducted a review of its 10 major pulp and paper
facilities to evaluate the facilities' compliance with federal
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations.  The
results of the reviews were disclosed to seven state agencies and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during 1994 and 1995.  All PSD
compliance issues identified in the review have been resolved, except
for PSD issues at the company's Springfield, Oregon, containerboard
facility.  A final decision is expected to be made by the Lane
Regional Air Pollution Control Authority (Lane County, Oregon)
concerning alleged PSD and permit violations at the company's
Springfield, Oregon, containerboard manufacturing facility upon
issuance of the facility's Title V permit in 2000.  In addition, the
company is conducting a review of one pulp and paper facility and two
wood products facilities that were recently acquired to evaluate their
compliance with PSD and new source review regulations.

In June 1998, a lawsuit was filed against the company in Superior
Court, San Francisco County, California, on behalf of a purported
class of individuals and entities that own property in the United
States on which exterior hardboard siding manufactured by the company
has been installed since 1981.  The action alleges the company
manufactured and distributed defective hardboard siding, breached
express warranties and consumer protection statutes and failed to
disclose to consumers the alleged defective nature of its hardboard
siding.  The action seeks compensatory and punitive damages, costs and
reasonable attorney fees.  In December 1998, the complaint was amended
narrowing the purported class to individuals and entities in the state
of California.  In February 1999, the court entered an order
certifying the class.  The company has been unable thus far to obtain
a reversal of the certification.  In September 1998, a lawsuit
purporting to be a class action involving hardboard siding was filed
against the company in Superior Court, King County, Washington.  The
complaint was amended, in January 1999, to allege a class consisting
of individuals and entities that own homes or other structures in the
United States on which exterior hardboard siding manufactured by the
company at its former Klamath Falls, Oregon, facility has been
installed since January 1981.  The amended complaint alleges the
company manufactured defective hardboard siding, engaged in unfair
trade practices and failed to disclose to customers the alleged
defective nature of its hardboard siding.  The amended complaint seeks
compensatory damages, punitive or treble damages, restitution,
attorney fees, costs of the suit and such other relief as may be
appropriate.  In July 1999, the company's motion for summary judgment
was granted in this case.  The plaintiffs filed a petition for
reconsideration which was denied in January 2000.  The plaintiffs have
appealed this decision.  A lawsuit was filed against the company in
District Court, Johnson County, Texas, in June 1999.  The case
purports to be a class action on behalf of persons who own structures
in the state of Texas with exterior hardboard siding manufactured by
the company.  The complaint alleges defective design,
misrepresentation, negligence, breach of express warranty and
fraudulent concealment.  The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory
damages.  In July 1999, a lawsuit was filed against the company in the
Court of Common Pleas, Beaufort County, South Carolina.  The suit
purports to be filed on behalf of all owners of residential structures
or other buildings with hardboard siding manufactured by the company.
The complaint alleges breach of express and implied warranties,
defective design and manufacture, fraud and violation of South
Carolina's unfair trade practices act.  The plaintiffs seek
compensatory damages, treble damages and attorneys' fees.  The company
is a defendant in two other cases, one in Iowa and the other in
Oregon, that purport to be statewide class actions with similar
allegations.  The company is a defendant in approximately 25 other
hardboard siding cases primarily involving multi-family structures and
residential developments.

In May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed against the
company in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Both suits name as defendants several other major containerboard and
packaging producers.  The complaint in the first case alleges the
defendants conspired to fix the price of linerboard and that the
alleged conspiracy had the effect of increasing the price of
corrugated containers.  The suit purports to be a class action on
behalf of purchasers of corrugated containers during the period
October 1993 through November 1995.  The complaint in the second case
alleges that the company conspired to manipulate the price of
linerboard and thereby the price of corrugated sheets.  The suit
purports to be a class action on behalf of purchasers of corrugated
sheets during the period October 1993 through November 1995.  Both
suits seek damages, including treble damages, under the antitrust
laws.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings-Continued
- ------------------------------------

In May 1999, the Equity Committee ("the Committee") in the Paragon
Trade Brands, Inc. bankruptcy proceeding filed a motion in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia for authority to
prosecute claims against the company in the name of the debtor's
estate.  Specifically, the Equity Committee seeks to assert that the
company breached certain warranties in agreements entered into between
Paragon and the company in connection with Paragon's public offering
of common stock in January 1993.  The Committee seeks to recover
damages sustained by Paragon as a result of two patent infringement
cases, one brought by Procter & Gamble and the other by Kimberly-
Clark.  In September 1999, the court authorized the Committee to
commence an adversary proceeding against the company.  The Committee
commenced this proceeding in October 1999, seeking damages in excess
of $420 million against the company.

Subsidiaries of the company, formerly known as MacMillan Bloedel
Limited and MacMillan Bloedel (USA) Inc., have agreed to settle a
class action suit involving claims in the United States (excluding
Colorado) alleging the failure of cement fiber roofing products
previously manufactured by American Cemwood Corporation, a company
owned by MacMillan Bloedel (USA) Inc.  The proposed settlement would
create a fund of $105 million, consisting of $65 million in cash and
$40 million guaranteed recovery by the class from certain insurance
carriers.  The settlement is subject to court approval in May 2000.
The company has established reserves for liabilities and legal defense
costs it believes are probable and reasonably estimable with respect
to the proposed settlement and pending suits and claims.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the
cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
"Superfund," and similar state laws.  The EPA and/or various state
agencies have notified the company that it may be a potentially
responsible party with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to
which no proceedings have been instituted against the company.  The
company is also a party to other legal proceedings and environmental
matters generally incidental to its business.  Although the final
outcome of any legal proceeding or environmental matter is subject to
a great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of
certainty, the company presently believes that any ultimate outcome
resulting from these proceedings and matters, or all of them combined,
would not have a material effect on the company's current financial
position, liquidity or results of operations; however, in any given
future reporting period, such proceedings or matters could have a
material effect on results of operations.

Report of Independent Public Accountants on Financial Statement
Schedules

To Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the financial statements included in  Weyerhaeuser
Company's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 9,
2000.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
those statements taken as a whole.  The schedule shown on page 17 is
the responsibility of the company's management and is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required
to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole.
