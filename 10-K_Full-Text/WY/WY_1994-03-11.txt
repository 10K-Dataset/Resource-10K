Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I
Item 1.  Business

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of
Washington in January 1900, as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.  It is
principally engaged in growing and harvesting of timber and the
manufacture, distribution and sale of forest products, real estate
development and construction, and financial services.  Its principal
business segments include timberlands and wood products, pulp and
paper products, real estate, and financial services.  A description of
each of these business segments follows.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The company owns approximately 5.5 million acres of commercial
forestland in the United States (50% in the South and 50% in the
Pacific Northwest),  most of it highly productive and located
extremely well to serve both domestic and international markets.  The
company has, additionally, long-term license arrangements in Canada
covering approximately 17.8 million acres (of which 14 million acres
are considered to be productive forestland).  The combined total
timber inventory on these U.S. and Canadian lands is approximately 245
million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which
approximately 75% is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber varies according to the species, size and quality of timber,
and will change through time as the mix of these variables changes.
To sustain the timber supply from its fee timberland, the company is
engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species,
precommercial and commercial thinning and fertilization and
operational pruning, all of which increase the yield from its fee
timberland acreage.

Part I
Item 3. Legal Proceedings

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Trial  began in May 1992 in a federal income tax refund case that  the
company  filed  in July 1989 in the United States Claims  Court.   The
complaint  seeks  a refund of federal income taxes  that  the  company
contends  it  overpaid in 1977 through 1983.  The alleged overpayments
are  the result of the disallowance of certain timber casualty  losses
and  certain  deductions claimed by the company  arising  from  export
transactions.   The refund sought was approximately $29 million,  plus
statutory  interest from the dates of the alleged  overpayments.   The
company has reached an agreement with the United States Department  of
Justice  to  settle  the  portion  of  the  case  relating  to  export
transactions.   That  settlement  has  been  approved  by  the   Joint
Committee  on Taxation of the U.S. Congress.  The tax refund remaining
in  dispute  is approximately $9 million plus statutory interest  from
the  dates  of the alleged overpayments.  The court has not entered  a
decision on the remaining issue.

On  March 6, 1992, the company filed a complaint in the Superior Court
for  King  County, Washington against a number of insurance companies.
The   complaint  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  insurance
companies  named  as  defendants are obligated  under  the  terms  and
conditions  of the policies sold by them to the company to defend  the
company  and to pay, on the company's behalf, certain claims  asserted
against  the  company.   The  claims relate to  alleged  environmental
damage  to third-party sites and to some of the company's own property
to  which allegedly toxic material was delivered or on which allegedly
toxic  material  was  placed in the past.  Since  December  1992,  the
company has agreed to settlements with six of the defendants.  In July
1993,  the  trial  court dismissed fourteen of the  thirty-five  sites
named  in the complaint.  Appeal of those dismissals was heard by  the
Washington  State Supreme Court on February 22, 1994.   Trial  on  two
sites is scheduled for October 1994.

In April 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
issued  an  amended  complaint adding the  company  as  an  additional
defendant  in an administrative proceeding under the Toxic  Substances
Control  Act (TSCA).  The proceeding seeks penalties of $171,000  from
all  defendants  with respect to alleged improper storage  and  record
keeping between 1980 and 1989 for certain transformers which contained
polychlorinated biphenyls.  The transformers, which the  company  sold
in 1980, were located at the company's former hardboard siding mill in
Doswell, Virginia.  The company is currently negotiating with the  EPA
to settle the matter with no admission of liability or penalties.

In   April   1992,  the  Georgia  Department  of  Natural   Resources,
Environmental Protection Division issued a Notice of Violation to  the
company's  Adel,  Georgia  particleboard plant  citing  violations  of
particulate emission standards.  A consent order was entered  into  on
September  18,  1992  assessing a $35,000  penalty  and  a  stipulated
penalty of $100 per day until the facility is in full compliance  with
particulate   emission  requirements.   The  Consent  Order   sets   a
compliance  deadline  of  January 31, 1994.  The  Consent  Order  also
requires  that  the  company  demonstrate  that  the  facility  is  in
compliance  with  regulations  under  the  Prevention  of  Significant
Deterioration (PSD) regulations under the Clean Air Act.  The  company
has  submitted compliance data and is awaiting the State's concurrence
that it satisfies the consent order requirements.

The  company  has  undertaken  a  review  of  all  its  wood  products
facilities  for compliance with the PSD regulations and has  disclosed
PSD  compliance  issues to certain state agencies and  the  EPA.   The
company  and  the  State  of Mississippi Department  of  Environmental
Quality  (DEQ)  have entered into a consent agreement  concerning  PSD
regulations  at  two  company  facilities  in  Mississippi   involving
penalties  of $170,000.  The State of Alabama has issued a  compliance
order  with  penalties  totaling $100,000 for noncompliance  with  PSD
regulations at the company's Millport facility.  The company and North
Carolina's  Division of Environmental Management have entered  into  a
consent  agreement  for its Elkin, North Carolina  facility  involving
penalties of $140,000 and are currently negotiating a separate consent
agreement for its Moncure, North Carolina facility involving penalties
of  $140,000.   The  company has signed a consent agreement  including
penalties  of $140,000 relating to PSD issues at the company's  Wright
City,  Oklahoma  facility  with the State of  Oklahoma  Department  of
Environmental Quality.  The company is negotiating a consent agreement
with  the  State  of Arkansas concerning PSD related  issues  for  two
facilities  in  that state involving $375,000 in total  penalties  for
both facilities.  Region V of the EPA has issued a Notice of Violation
for  permit  violations at the company's Grayling, Michigan  facility.
The   company  is  negotiating  settlement  of  those  alleged  permit
violations  and other PSD related issues with the Michigan  Department
of  Natural Resources and the EPA that may involve penalties of up  to
$416,000.  In September 1992, the EPA issued a Section 114 Request for
Information concerning PSD compliance at the company's oriented strand
board  and  medium density fiberboard mills.  In June  1993,  the  EPA
issued  a  similar Section 114 request for the company's  plywood  and
particleboard mills.  The company is also undertaking a review of  its
pulp and paper facilities for PSD compliance.


Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries


Part I
Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Continued

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On  April  9, 1993, the company entered into a Stipulated Final  Order
(SFO)  with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for alleged
air  emissions in excess of permit levels and PSD noncompliance at the
company's  North  Bend,  Oregon  containerboard  facility.   The   SFO
establishes  a compliance schedule for installing control  technology.
A   supplemental  SFO  assessed  upfront  penalties  of  $247,000  and
penalties of $500 per day until compliance is demonstrated.   The  SFO
requires  demonstrated compliance by December 1993  and  a  historical
evaluation of the facility's PSD status.  The company has submitted  a
plant site PSD review to the state and is awaiting its review.

In  August  1992, the EPA issued an administrative complaint  for  the
assessment  of  $215,000  in  civil penalties  against  the  company's
Longview,  Washington facility.  The penalties are based upon  alleged
violations  of  the  record  keeping and  storage  provisions  of  the
polychlorinated  biphenyls rules contained in the TSCA.   The  company
and  the  EPA settled the complaint for a maximum penalty of $118,150,
50%  of which was paid when the settlement was signed.  Payment of the
remaining  50%  was  deferred  and will be  eliminated  based  on  the
expenditure  of  more than $118,150 by the company to dispose  of  PCB
contaminated transformers at Longview during 1993.

On  November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company  in  the
Circuit  Court  for  the  First Judicial  District  of  Hinds  County,
Mississippi on behalf of a purported class of riparian property owners
in  Mississippi  and  Alabama  whose properties  are  located  on  the
Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar  Creek  and  the
Magoway  Creek.   The complaint seeks $1 billion in  compensatory  and
punitive  damages for diminution in property value, personal  injuries
and mental anguish allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous  substances, including dioxins and furans, by the  company's
pulp   and  paper  mill  in  Columbus,  Mississippi  and  the  alleged
fraudulent  concealments of such discharge.  The complaint also  seeks
an injunction prohibiting future releases and the removal of hazardous
substances  allegedly released in the past.  On  August  20,  1993,  a
companion  action was filed in Green County, Alabama on  behalf  of  a
similar  purported class of riparian owners with essentially the  same
claims as the Mississippi case.  The action was removed to the Federal
District   Court   for  the  Northern  District  of   Alabama,   which
subsequently remanded the case to state court.

Trial  began in January 1994 in the United States District  Court  for
the  District  of Alaska of claims filed against Weyerhaeuser  by  two
corporations  with  which  Weyerhaeuser  had  entered  into  financing
arrangements,  a  marketing  agreement,  and  a  technical  assistance
agreement.    The   plaintiffs   claim  that   Weyerhaeuser   breached
contractual  and common law duties by allegedly failing to  adequately
market   and  ship  the  plaintiffs'  products,  misrepresenting   its
marketing  and  shipping  capabilities,  and  acting  to  further  its
interests  at  the plaintiffs' expense.  The plaintiffs in  the  First
Amended  Complaint,  filed in May 1992, seek  an  unstated  amount  of
damages  described  as  more than $50 million in compensatory  damages
plus  not  less than $75 million in punitive damages.  The  claim  for
punitive damages has been dismissed by the trial court.

The  company  is also a party to various proceedings relating  to  the
clean   up   of   hazardous  waste  sites  under   the   Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly  known
as  "Superfund," and similar state laws.  The Environmental Protection
Agency and/or various state agencies have notified the company that it
may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous
waste  sites  as to which no proceedings have been instituted  against
the  company.  The company is also a party to other legal  proceedings
generally  incidental to its business.  Although the final outcome  of
any  legal proceeding is subject to a great many variables and  cannot
be  predicted  with  any  degree of certainty, the  company  presently
believes  that  any  ultimate  liability  resulting  from  the   legal
proceedings discussed herein, or all of them combined, would not  have
a material effect on the company's financial position.

this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 8,
1994. Our report on the financial statements includes an explanatory
paragraph with respect to the change in the method of accounting for
income taxes and postretirement benefits other than pensions.  Our
audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed on page 15 are the
responsibility of the company's management and are presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and are not part of the basic financial statements. These
schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly state in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.
