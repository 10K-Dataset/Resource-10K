Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I

Item 1. Business

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of Washington
in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. It is principally engaged in
the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture, distribution and sale of
forest products; and real estate development and construction. Its principal
business segments are Timberlands; Wood Products; Pulp and Paper;
Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling; and Real Estate and Related Assets.
Throughout this document, the term “company” refers to Weyerhaeuser Company and
all of its majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The term
“Weyerhaeuser” refers to the forest products-based operations and excludes the
Real Estate and Related Assets operations.

Information with respect to the description and general development of the
company’s business, included on pages 14 through 23 and 26 through 29,

Description of the Business of the Company

, contained in the company’s

Annual Report to Shareholders

Timberlands

Weyerhaeuser is engaged in the management of 6.7 million acres of company-owned
and .8 million acres of leased commercial forestland in North America, most of
it highly productive and located extremely well to serve both domestic and
international markets. Weyerhaeuser also has renewable, long-term licenses on
29.9 million acres of forestland located in five provinces throughout Canada
that are managed by our Canadian operations. The standing timber inventory on
these lands is approximately 493 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of
solid wood). The relationship between cubic measurement and the quantity of
end products that may be produced from timber varies according to the species,
size and quality of timber, and will change through time as the mix of these
variables changes. The end products are generally measured in board feet for
lumber and square feet for panel products. To sustain the timber supply from
its fee timberlands, Weyerhaeuser is engaged in extensive planting, suppression
of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and commercial thinning,
fertilization, and operational pruning, all of which increase the yield from
its fee timberland acreage.

Hardboard Siding Claims.

The company announced in June 2000 it had entered into
a proposed nationwide settlement of its hardboard siding class action cases
and, as a result, took a charge of $130 million before taxes to cover the
estimated cost of the settlement and related claims. The court approved the
settlement in December 2000. An appeal from the settlement was denied in March
2002, and the settlement is now binding on all parties. In the third quarter
of 2001, the company reassessed the adequacy of the reserve and increased the
reserve by an additional $43 million. The company incurred claims and related
costs in the amount of $11 million in 2003, $11 million in 2002 and $37 million
in 2001 and charged these costs against the reserve. As of December 28, 2003,
the company had approximately $83 million in reserves remaining for hardboard
siding claims. While the company believes that the reserve balances
established for these matters are adequate, the company is unable to estimate
at this time the amount of additional charges, if any, that may be required for
these matters in the future.

The settlement class consists of all persons who own or owned structures in the
United States on which the company’s hardboard siding had been installed from
January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1999. This is a claims-based settlement,
which means that the claims will be paid as submitted over a nine-year period.
An independent adjuster will review each claim submitted and determine whether
it qualifies for payment under the terms of the settlement agreement. The
following table presents an analysis of the claims activity related to the
hardboard siding class action cases:




Number of claims filed during the period

1,830


Average damage award paid

$

3,400

$

1,900

$

1,700

The increase in the average damage award paid in 2003 was due primarily to the
existence of more awards for multi-family structures and fewer awards for
single family residences in 2003 than in 2002 or 2001.

The company negotiated settlements with its insurance carriers for recovery of
$52 million of costs related to these claims. The company has received the
full $52 million in recoveries from its insurance carriers.

The company is a defendant in state trial court in three cases that are outside
of the settlement involving primarily multi-family structures and residential
developments. One of those cases was settled in January 2004, and the impact
was not significant. The company anticipates that other individuals and
entities that have opted out of the settlement may file lawsuits against the
company. In January 2002, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the company in
a lawsuit involving hardboard siding manufactured by the company and installed
by a developer in a residential development located in Modesto, California.
The verdict has been appealed and is not included in the three cases mentioned
at the state court level.

Antitrust Litigation.

In May 1999, two civil antitrust lawsuits were filed
against the company in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Both suits name as defendants several other major containerboard and packaging
producers. The complaint in the first case alleges the defendants conspired to
fix the price of linerboard and that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of
increasing the price of corrugated containers. The suit requested class
certification for purchasers of corrugated containers during the period from
October 1993 through November 1995. The complaint in the second case alleges
that the
company conspired to manipulate the price of linerboard and thereby the price
of corrugated sheets. The suit requested class certification for purchasers of
corrugated sheets during the period October 1993 through November 1995. Both
suits seek damages, including treble damages, under the antitrust laws. No
specific damage amounts have been claimed. In September 2001, the district
court certified both classes. Class certification was upheld on appeal and
class members were given until June 9, 2003, to opt out of the class.
Approximately 165 members of the classes have opted out and filed lawsuits
against the company in federal and state courts. In September 2003, the company, Georgia-Pacific and
International Paper filed a motion with the court requesting preliminary
approval of a $68 million settlement of the class action litigation.
Weyerhaeuser’s portion was approximately $23 million before taxes. The company
recognized an after-tax charge of $15 million, or 7 cents per share, in the
third quarter of 2003. The court granted final approval of the settlement in
December 2003. Since no objections were filed, the settlement is final and
binding on the companies and class members. The company has not
recorded a reserve for the opt-out cases and is unable to estimate at this time
the amount of charges, if any, that may be required for this matter in the
future.

In December 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the company in U.S. District
Court in Oregon alleging that from 1996 to present, the company had monopoly
power or attempted to gain monopoly power in the Pacific Northwest market for
alder logs and finished alder lumber. In August 2001, the complaint was
amended to add an additional plaintiff. Prior to trial, one of the plaintiffs
withdrew from the litigation. In April 2003, the jury returned a verdict in
favor of one of the plaintiffs in the amount of $26 million, which was
automatically trebled to $79 million under the antitrust laws. The company
took a pretax charge of $79 million in its first quarter 2003 results. The
company’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied in July
2003. The company has appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. While the company believes that the reserve balance established
for this matter is adequate, the company is unable to estimate at this time the
amount of additional charges, if any, which may be required for this matter in
the future.

In April 2003, two separate lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in
Oregon alleging that the company violated antitrust laws by monopolizing the
markets for alder sawlogs and finished alder lumber. In June 2003, amended
complaints were filed in both matters. The first suit (the Westwood case) was
brought by four separate corporations located in Oregon and Washington that
allege that between 1999 and the present, they suffered damages and asked the
court to award damages, after trebling, of $101 million. Plaintiffs’ request
for a temporary restraining order prohibiting the company from certain alder
log-buying practices was denied by the court. The complaint also requests
divestiture of a number of alder sawmills in Oregon, Washington and British
Columbia. In July 2003, the company filed a motion to dismiss based on the
insufficiencies in the pleadings. The judge directed the plaintiffs to correct
deficiencies in the pleadings but refused to dismiss the case. The company
renewed its motion to dismiss after review of the amended complaint. In
November 2003, the court granted the company’s motion to dismiss the amended
complaint because it failed to state a claim under the federal antitrust laws.
The judge gave the plaintiffs five business days to file a new complaint to
correct the deficiencies in the amended complaint. In November 2003 the court
allowed a third amended complaint to be filed. The court also ruled that
Weyerhaeuser would be precluded from litigating whether it attempted to and did
willfully acquire and maintain monopoly power over alder sawlogs in the Pacific
Northwest through anti-competitive conduct between 1996 and 2001. The court
also precluded Weyerhaeuser from contesting that its conduct did not cause the
prevailing plaintiff in the alder case that is on appeal material antitrust
injury. We believe the court’s rulings are wrong as a matter of law and filed
a motion to certify the matter for immediate appellate review by the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or, in the alternative, for reconsideration by
the trial court. The trial court denied both motions in December 2003. The
case is scheduled to go to trial on March 9, 2004. We have recently received
information from plaintiffs seeking a range of damages, after trebling, of
between $81 million and $118 million. The second suit was brought by Coast
Mountain Hardwoods, Inc., a Canadian company that sold its assets to the
company in 2000. In its proposed third amended complaint, the
plaintiff alleges two causes of action, one for attempted monopolization of
alder saw log and finished lumber markets, and a second cause of action for
fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. On the antitrust cause of action,
plaintiff seeks damages, after trebling, in the amount of $90 million (plus
attorney’s fees, costs and disbursements). On the fraud and breach of
fiduciary cause of action, plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount
of $30 million and punitive damages of $300 million. There is no trebling
associated with the second cause of action. Request for divestiture of the
company’s Northwest Hardwoods Division, a portion of its alder sawmills in
British Columbia, Oregon and Washington; and certain forest licenses acquired
in Canada have been dropped from the complaint. The company filed a motion to
dismiss on the basis that the case should be heard in Canada rather than the
United States because it involves an acquisition approved by Canadian
regulatory bodies. The motion to dismiss was denied in October 2003. The
company filed a motion for summary judgment on all antitrust claims. The court
denied this motion in February 2004. Trial of this case is scheduled to begin
on June 1, 2004. In June 2003, an alder antitrust complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in
Oregon by Washington Alder, an alder sawmill located in Washington. The
complaint alleges monopolization of the alder log and lumber markets from 1998
to present and seeks damages, after trebling, of $32 million. The company
filed a motion to dismiss based on insufficiencies in the pleadings. In
November 2003, the court granted the company’s motion to dismiss the amended
complaint because it failed to state a claim under the federal antitrust laws.
The judge gave the plaintiff five business days to file a new complaint to
correct the deficiencies in the amended complaint. In November 2003, a second
amended complaint was filed. In December 2003, the court denied our motion to
consolidate this matter with the Westwood case and trial is scheduled to
begin on May 11, 2004. Although the company denies liability
and is vigorously defending these follow-on cases, all of the
follow-on cases will be presided over by the same judge who presided
in the case that is on appeal and the judge has issued a number of
rulings adverse to the company, including a ruling in the Westwood case precluding the company from contesting key issues that
were decided against the company in the alder lawsuit on appeal.
Accordingly, the company recognizes that the company is not likely to prevail at the
trial court level in these cases and intends to appeal any adverse
judgments in these cases. The company has not recorded reserves related to
these lawsuits and is unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges, if
any, that may be required for these lawsuits in the future.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Paragon Trade Brands, Inc., Litigation.

In May 1999, the Equity Committee
(Committee) in the Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. (Paragon), bankruptcy proceeding
filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia
for authority to prosecute claims against the company in the name of the
debtor’s estate. Specifically, the Committee asserted that the
company breached certain warranties in agreements entered into between Paragon
and the company in connection with Paragon’s public offering of common stock in
January 1993. The Committee seeks to recover damages sustained by Paragon as a
result of two patent infringement cases, one brought by Procter & Gamble and
the other by Kimberly-Clark. In September 1999, the court authorized the
Committee to commence an adversary proceeding against the company. The
Committee commenced this proceeding in October 1999. Pursuant to a
reorganization of Paragon, the litigation claims representative for the
bankruptcy estate became the plaintiff in the proceeding. In June 2002, the
Bankruptcy Court issued an oral opinion granting the plaintiff’s motion for
partial summary judgment, holding the company liable to plaintiff for breaches
of warranty and denying the company’s motion for summary judgment. In October
2002, the Bankruptcy Court issued a written order confirming the June oral
opinion. In November 2002, the company filed a motion for reconsideration with
the Bankruptcy Court. In June 2003, the judge issued an oral ruling denying
the motion for reconsideration and set an October 30, 2003, trial date for
determination of the damages. In September 2003, the U.S. District Court
declined to grant discretionary review of the bankruptcy court’s partial
summary judgment decision on liability. The damages phase of the case began on
October 30, 2003, and was concluded on December 16, 2003. The bankruptcy court
initially asked both parties to present findings of fact and conclusions of law
by the end of January 2004 but then extended the date to February 9, 2004. The
damages requested by the plaintiff have changed. In October 1999, the
plaintiff was seeking damages in excess of $420 million. In its
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the plaintiff requested damages in the range of
$675 to $832 million, primarily as a result of a new request for prejudgment
interest. The company believes the plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment
interest under applicable law. The amount of damages, if any, the company may
ultimately be exposed to is dependent on many unknown factors such as how the
damages issues remaining to be decided by the bankruptcy court are resolved;
whether an appeal to the U.S. District Court and/or Court of Appeals for the

th

Circuit is successful; the outcome of any retrial ordered by an appellate
court; and whether a summary judgment in favor of the company on liability is
ordered by an appellate court. The company has not established a reserve for
this matter and is unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges, if
any, that may be required in the future. The company plans to appeal the
partial summary judgment decision on liability and any damages award on
completion of the damages phase of the trial.

Other Litigation.

The company is a party to other matters generally incidental
to its business in addition to the matters described above.

Summary.

Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding is subject to a
great many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty,
management currently believes that adequate reserves have been established for
probable losses from litigation when the amount could be reasonably determined.
Management further believes that the ultimate outcome of these legal
proceedings could be material to operating results or cash flows in any given
quarter or year but will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s
long-term results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

Countervailing and Anti-dumping Duties

In April of 2001, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (Coalition) filed two
petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (Department) and the
International Trade Commission (ITC), claiming that production of softwood
lumber in Canada was being subsidized by Canada and that imports from Canada
were being “dumped” into the U.S. market (sold at less than fair value). The
Coalition asked that countervailing duty (CVD) and anti-dumping tariffs be
imposed on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

In March 2002, the Department confirmed its preliminary finding that certain
Canadian provinces were subsidizing logs by failing to collect full market
price for stumpage. The Department established a final CVD rate of 18.79
percent. In the anti-dumping proceedings, the Department found that the six
Canadian manufacturers examined, including the company, were engaged in sales
at less than fair value and set cash deposit rates ranging from 2.18 percent to
12.44 percent. The company’s deposit rate was set at 12.39 percent. Because of statutory
limitations that affected timing, the bonds covering duties following the
preliminary determinations were released by the United States. The resulting
reversal of accrued expenses was included in earnings during 2002.

In May 2002, the ITC confirmed its earlier ruling that U.S. industry is
threatened by subsidized and dumped imports. As a result, the company has made
cash deposits relating to the CVD and anti-dumping actions at the rate of
approximately $25 to $30 million a quarter. Following is a summary of the CVD
and anti-dumping amounts recorded in the company’s statement of earnings:

In June 2003, the Department began the process of an annual review to determine
whether the company had engaged in dumping and whether Canada continued to
subsidize softwood logs and, if so, the dumping duty and CVD to impose. It is
expected that final verification and determination should be complete in late
2004. The determination will be subject to further review if appealed. The
annual review process will be conducted for a period of five years. In 2007,
both the countervailing duty and anti-dumping orders will be automatically
reviewed in a “sunset” proceeding to determine whether dumping will continue or
a countervailing subsidy is likely to recur.

The Canadian Government, the company and other Canadian companies appealed the
Department’s (anti-dumping and CVD) and the ITC’s (injury) 2002 determinations
in separate appeals under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The
panel convened to review the Department’s findings on anti-dumping ruled that
the Department must change its methodology for computing differences in
merchandise when there is no product sold domestically that is similar to the
exported product and, as a result, “comparable” products are used to calculate
whether dumping is occurring. The panel convened to review the CVD decision
ruled that cross-border comparisons are an invalid method to determine and
measure subsidies. Finally, the panel convened to review the ITC finding of a
threat of injury found that the ITC’s findings were not supported by the record
and ordered the ITC to reconsider the findings. If the ITC fails to support
its findings of threat of injury, the deposits collected to date would be
refunded.

With the support of provincial governments, the federal government of Canada
also moved for review by dispute settlement panels under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and those reviews are currently in process. One WTO panel
has also issued an opinion finding that cross-border comparisons to determine
and measure subsidies are not proper. In addition, the WTO appeals body has
affirmed a panel ruling against the United States that the so-called “Byrd
Amendment,” which gives U.S. firms cash from anti-dumping and countervailing
duties applied on foreign imports, is inconsistent with U.S. international
obligations. The U.S. administration has recommended that the law be changed
to comply with that ruling, but whether or when Congress will implement that
recommendation is uncertain.

In December 2003, the Department issued a decision on the remand from the NAFTA
Panel in the CVD investigation. If the decision on remand is not further
appealed or altered, it would have the effect of reducing the applicable CVD
deposit rate to 13.3 percent. In addition, the WTO appellate body recently
issued a decision in the CVD case, and a WTO panel is expected to issue a
decision shortly in the anti-dumping case. It is not possible to predict
whether these decisions will be appealed or their impact on Weyerhaeuser’s
business at this time.

It is difficult to predict the net effect final duties will have on the
company. In the event that final rates differ from the depository rates,
ultimate charges may be higher or lower than those recorded to date. The
company is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges or
reversals that may be necessary for this matter in the future. The U.S. and
Canadian governments continue to discuss ways to settle the softwood lumber
dispute, but there can be no assurance that they will be able to reach
agreement or the terms and conditions of any agreement.

Environmental Matters

In April 1999, Willamette’s
Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania, paper and pulp mill received a
notice of violation (NOV) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Management has met with
federal and state officials to resolve the matters alleged in the NOV and will
continue to work with officials to narrow issues in dispute. Management
believes that it is reasonably possible that a settlement will be reached at a
future date, that may involve payment of a penalty of up to approximately $1
million and the installation of pollution control equipment.

The company is also a party to various proceedings relating to the cleanup of
hazardous waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as “Superfund,” and similar
state laws. The EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the company
that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous
waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the
company. The company has established reserves for remediation costs on all of
the approximately 73 active sites across its operations as of the end of 2003
totaling $51 million, down from $54 million at the end of 2002. This decrease
reflects the incorporation of new information on all sites concerning
remediation alternatives, updates on prior cost estimates and new sites, less
the costs incurred to remediate these sites during this period. The company
accrued remediation costs of $14 million in 2003 and $18 million in 2002. In
2001, the company reduced the accruals by $8 million. The company incurred
remediation costs of $8 million in 2003, $9 million in 2002 and $14 million in
2001 and charged these costs against the reserve. Additionally, the company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

as of the beginning of 2003.
Because the asset retirement obligations associated with landfills are accounted
for separately, the company reduced its remediation cost accrual by $9 million
as of the date it adopted the provisions of Statement 143. Based on currently
available information and analysis, the company believes that it is reasonably
possible that costs associated with all identified sites may exceed current
accruals by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range, in the
aggregate, up to approximately $70 million over several years. This estimate of
the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less
certain than the estimates upon which accruals are currently based, and
utilizes assumptions less favorable to the company among the range of
reasonably possible outcomes. In estimating both its current accruals for
environmental remediation and the possible range of additional future costs,
the company has assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of
every site to the exclusion of other known potentially responsible parties who
may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other potentially
responsible parties to participate has been taken into account, based generally
on each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site
basis.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Information with respect to Management’s Discussion and Analysis included on
pages 30-41 of the company’s

2003 Annual Report to Shareholders

, is
incorporated herein by reference.

The company’s expectations of segment performance in the first quarter of 2004
follow.

Timberlands

The company expects that the Timberlands segment’s contribution to earnings in
the first quarter of 2004 will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2003,
excluding the 2003 pretax gains on the sale on nonstrategic timberlands in the
Carolinas and Tennessee, due primarily to higher domestic log sales volumes and
prices in the West and higher seasonal fee harvest in the South.

Wood Products

Lumber and OSB prices increased early in the first quarter of 2004 as customers
began accumulating inventories in anticipation of a strong building season.
The increase in OSB prices was particularly sharp. High OSB prices
will adversely impact first quarter earnings for the engineered
lumber products business, but will be partially offset by first
quarter price increases. Lumber and OSB prices are
sensitive to weather-related disruptions, however the company expects
these disruptions to be minimal in the first quarter. Woods
Product’s prices have remained strong throughout the first
quarter and first quarter earnings for the segment are expected to be
above fourth quarter 2003 levels. The
company expects Wood Products’ earnings to continue to be
adversely affected by the
Canadian softwood lumber issue.

Item 7. Management’s

Operations

Pulp and Paper

Pulp and Paper’s loss is expected to narrow in the first quarter of 2004 due to
increased demand for fine paper, reduced downtime and improving softwood pulp
markets. The company has implemented price increases for pulp and has
announced additional price increases for both pulp and paper in the
first quarter of  2004. In addition, the company will continue to
focus on inventory management to match supply with demand and will
assess rationalization, as necessary.

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling

Earnings for this segment in the first quarter of 2004 are expected to be down from the fourth
quarter of 2003 due primarily to lower average box prices in the
first quarter, which reflect the impact of fourth quarter 2003 index
price declines, and higher raw material costs. The company announced a price increase of $40 per ton on
containerboard effective March 1, 2004, and an additional $10
per ton increase, effective April 1, 2004. The Company has also announced
box price increases to reflect higher containerboard prices.  However, because of various customer
contract provisions, impacts of the price increase are not expected
to be realized until the second quarter. Volumes are expected to improve seasonally and
year-over-year during the first quarter of 2004, and increases in operating
rates are expected to result in lower manufacturing costs during the first
quarter of 2004. In addition, the company will continue to focus on inventory
management to match supply with demand and will assess rationalization, as
necessary.

Real Estate and Related Assets

First quarter earnings for Real Estate
and Related Assets are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter of 2003,
as markets are expected to remain strong. Real Estate and Related Assets has a
backlog of approximately six months of homes sold, but not closed.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some information included in this report contains statements concerning the
company’s future results and performance that are forward-looking statements

The company is also a large exporter and is affected by changes in economic
activity in Europe and Asia, particularly Japan, and by changes in currency
exchange rates, particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Euro
and the Canadian dollar, and restrictions on international trade or tariffs
imposed on imports, including the countervailing and anti-dumping duties
imposed on the company’s softwood lumber shipments from Canada to the United
States. These and other factors could cause or contribute to actual results
differing materially from such forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no
assurances
can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking
statements will occur, or if any of them occurs, what effect they will have on
the company’s results of operations or financial condition. The company
expressly declines any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.
Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on their evaluation, the company’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer believe the controls and procedures in place are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed complies with the
SEC’s rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes in the
company’s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the company’s fourth fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Company:

Under date of February 11, 2004, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets
of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2003, and December
29, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and
shareholders’ interest for each of the years in the two-year period then
ended, which report is incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form
10-K. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated
financial statements, we also audited the related financial statement schedule
in this Form 10-K for the years ended December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002.
This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth herein.

The consolidated financial statements of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries
as of December 30, 2001, and for the year then ended, were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements, those financial statements have been revised to include
the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,

which was adopted by
the company as of December 31, 2001. Further, as described in Note 22 to the
consolidated financial statements, the company changed the composition of its
reportable segments in 2003 and 2002, and the amounts in the 2001 financial
statements relating to reportable segments have been restated to conform to the
2003 composition of reportable segments. We audited the 2001 adjustments to
Note 4 and the adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for
reportable segments reflected in the 2001 financial statements. In our
opinion, the 2001 disclosure in Note 22 is appropriate and the 2001 adjustments
to Note 4 are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not
engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial
statements of the company other than with respect to such disclosures and
adjustments, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any form of
assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Weyerhaeuser
Company and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

, in
2003.
