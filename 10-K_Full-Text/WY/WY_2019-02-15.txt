OUR BUSINESS

We are one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands. We own or control

12.2 million

acres of timberlands in the U.S. and manage an additional

14.0 million

acres of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. We manage these timberlands on a sustainable basis in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. Our objective is to maximize the long-term value of timberlands we own. We analyze each timberland acre comprehensively to understand its highest-value use. We realize this value in many ways, particularly through growing and harvesting the trees, but also by selling properties when we can create incremental value. In addition, we focus on opportunities to realize value for oil and natural gas production, construction aggregates and mineral extraction, wind and solar power, communication tower leases and transportation rights of way that exist in our ownership.

We are also one of the largest manufacturers of wood products in North America. We manufacture and distribute high-quality wood products, including structural lumber, oriented strand board (OSB), engineered wood products and other specialty products. These products are primarily supplied to the residential, multi-family, industrial, light commercial and repair and remodel markets. We operate


manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada.

Our company is a real estate investment trust (REIT).

Sustainability and citizenship are part of our core values. In addition to practicing sustainable forestry, we focus on increasing energy and resource efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing water consumption, conserving natural resources and offering sustainable products that meet our customers' needs. We operate with world class safety results, actively support the communities in which we operate and strive to communicate transparently with our investors and other stakeholders. We are the only North American forest products company included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and we also are recognized for our leading performance in the areas of ethics, citizenship and gender equality.

In


, we generated

$7.5 billion

in net sales and employed approximately

9,300

people who serve customers worldwide.

This portion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K provides detailed information about who we are, what we do and where we are headed. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Form 10-K is as of or for the fiscal year ended

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

We meet the information-reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by filing periodic reports (annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q), current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports and statements — information about our company’s business, financial results and other matters — and amendments to these reports and statements are available at:

WHO WE ARE

We were incorporated as

Weyerhaeuser Timber Company

in the state of Washington in January 1900, when Frederick Weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900,000 acres of timberland. Today, we are working to be the world's premier timber, land, and forest products company for our shareholders, customers and employees.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) ELECTION

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from our timberlands, including gains from the sales of our standing timber and rent from recreational leases. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which includes our Wood Products segment and a portion of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segments.

EFFECT OF MARKET CONDITIONS

The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects the performance of all our business segments. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand. Real Estate is affected by local real estate market conditions, such as the level of supply or demand for properties sharing the same or similar characteristics as our timberlands. Energy and Natural Resources is affected by underlying demand for commodities, including oil and gas.

COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS

We operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets, with numerous companies selling similar products. Many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood products. We compete in our markets primarily through product quality, service levels and price. We are relentlessly focused on operational excellence, producing quality products customers want and are willing to pay for, at the lowest possible cost.

Our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows:

•

Timberlands — Deliver maximum timber value from every acre we own or manage.

•

Real Estate & ENR — Deliver premiums to timberland value by identifying and monetizing higher and better use lands and capturing the full value of surface and subsurface assets.

•

Wood Products — Manufacture high-quality lumber, structural panels, and engineered wood products, as well as deliver complementary building products for residential, multi-family, industrial and light commercial applications at competitive costs.

OUR EMPLOYEES

We have approximately

9,300

employees. Of these employees, approximately

2,500

are members of unions covered by multi-year collective-bargaining agreements. More information about these agreements is provided in

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

WHAT WE DO

This section provides information about how we:

•

grow and harvest trees,

•

maximize the value of every acre we own and

•

manufacture and sell wood products.

For each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed.

TIMBERLANDS

Our Timberlands segment manages

12.2 million

acres of private commercial timberlands in the U.S. We own

11.4 million

of those acres and control the remaining acres through long-term contracts. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on

14.0 million

acres of Canadian timberlands. The tables presented in this section include data from this segment's business units as of the end of


.

WHAT WE DO

Forestry Management

Our Timberlands segment:

•

plants seedlings to reforest harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species (natural regeneration is employed and managed in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.);

•

manages our timberlands as the trees grow to maturity;

•

harvests trees to be converted into lumber, wood products, pellets, pulp and paper;

•

manages the health of our forests to sustainably maximize harvest volumes, minimize risks, and protect unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value; and

•

offers recreational access.

We seek to maximize the returns from our timberlands by selling delivered logs and through stumpage sales to both internal and external customers. We leverage our expertise in forestry and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis. We use our scale, infrastructure and supply chain expertise to deliver reliable and consistent supply to our customers.

Competitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to wood consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements. We compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices. Our customers also value our status as a Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI) certified supplier.

Sustainable Forestry Practices

We manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers. At the same time, we are careful to protect biological diversity, water quality and other ecosystem values. Our working forests also provide unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value. We work hard to protect these and other qualities, while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber. We follow regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our North American timberlands under the SFI Forest Management Standard.

Canadian Forestry Operations

In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide the primary source of the raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government. We transfer logs to our

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit in the Timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in Canada.

Timberlands Products

HOW WE MEASURE OUR PRODUCT

We use multiple units of measure when transacting business including:

•

Thousand board feet (MBF) — used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log; and

•

Green tons (GT) — used in the South to measure weight; factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and season.

We report Timberlands volumes in ton equivalents.

WHERE WE DO IT

We sustainably manage timberlands in twenty states. This includes owned or contracted acres in the following locations:

•

2.9 million

acres in the western U.S. (Oregon and Washington);

•

6.9 million

acres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia); and

•

2.4 million

acres in the northern U.S. (Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin).

In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities. These licenses are in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario (license is managed by partnership) and Saskatchewan (license is managed by partnership).

Our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and contracted land— is approximately

626 million

tons. The amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the species, size and quality of the timber; and will change through time as these variables adjust.

We maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system (“GIS”). The resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods, including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization. The GIS component is based on GIS software that is viewed as the standard in our industry.

Timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies. The data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level.

We also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, and Washington

Summary of


Timberland Locations

We provide a year-round flow of logs to internal and external customers. We sell grade and fiber logs to manufacturers that produce a diverse range of products. We also sell standing timber to third parties and lease land for recreational purposes. Our timberlands are generally well located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to customers.

Western United States

Our Western timberlands are well situated to serve the wood products and pulp markets in Oregon and Washington. Additionally, our location on the West Coast provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas fir and whitewood logs to Japan, China and Korea. Our largest export market is Japan, where Douglas fir is the preferred species for higher-valued post and beam homebuilding. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, competitively positions us to meet the needs of Pacific Rim log markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 24 percent of our total western log sales volume internally.

Our holdings are composed primarily of Douglas fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength, stiffness and visual appearance. Most of our lands are located on the west side of the Cascade Mountain Range with soil and rainfall conditions considered favorable for growing this species. Approximately 80 percent of our lands are in established Douglas fir plantations. Our remaining holdings include a mix of whitewood and hardwood.

Our management systems and supply chain expertise provide us a competitive operating advantage in a number of areas including forestry and research, harvesting, marketing, and logistics. Additionally, our scale, diversity of timberlands ownership and infrastructure on the West Coast allow us to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round.

We sell recreational use permits covering approximately 2 million acres of our owned Western timberlands.

Western U.S. Inventory by Species


Western U.S. Inventory by Age / Species

The average age of timber harvested from our Western timberlands in


was 51 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest approximately 2 percent of our Western acreage each year.

Southern United States

Our Southern timberland ownership, covering 11 states, is well situated to serve domestic wood products and pulp markets, including third-party customers and our own mills. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 24 percent of our total southern log sales volume internally. Additionally, our Atlantic and Gulf coastal locations position us to serve a developing Asian log export market. Our holdings are comprised of 76 percent Southern yellow pine and 24 percent hardwoods.

We intensively manage our Southern timber plantations using:

•

forestry research and planning systems to optimize log production,

•

customized silviculture prescriptions which increase productivity across our acreage and

•

innovative planting and harvesting techniques on varying Southern terrain.

Operationally, we focus on efficiently harvesting and hauling logs from our ownership and capitalizing on our scale and supply chain expertise to consistently and reliably serve a broad range of customers through seasonal and weather-related events year-round.

We lease more than 94 percent of our owned Southern acreage for recreational purposes.

Southern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species

The average age of timber harvested from our Southern timberlands in


was 31 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest approximately 3 percent of our acreage each year in the South.

Northern United States

We are one of the largest private owners of northern hardwood timberlands. Our Northern acres contain a diverse mix of temperate broadleaf hardwoods and mixed conifer species across timberlands located in seven states. We grow over 50 species and market over 600 product grades to a diverse mix of customers.

Our large-diameter cherry, red oak and hard maple saw logs and veneer logs serve domestic and export furniture markets. Our maple and other appearance woods are used in furniture and high-value decorative applications. In addition to high value hardwood saw logs, our mix includes hardwood fiber logs for pulp and OSB applications. Hardwood pulpwood is a significant market in the Northern region and we have long term supply agreements, primarily at market rates, for nearly 83 percent of our hardwood pulp production.

We also grow softwood logs that supply our Montana medium density fiberboard (MDF), lumber and plywood mills and other customers. Our competitive advantages include a merchandising program to capture the value of the premium hardwood logs.

Regeneration is predominantly natural, augmented by planting where appropriate.


Northern U.S. Inventory by Species


Northern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species

The average age of timber harvested from our Northern timberlands in


was 62 years. Timber harvested in the North is sold predominantly as delivered logs to domestic mills, including our manufacturing facilities located in Montana and West Virginia. For the year ended

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



December 31, 2018

, we sold 13 percent of our total northern log sales volume internally. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest approximately 1 percent of our acreage each year in the North.

Canada — Licensed Timberlands

We manage timberlands in Canada under long-term licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. The provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC), which are updated every 10 years. As of

December 31, 2018

, our AAC by province was:

•

Alberta — 2,914 thousand tons,

•

British Columbia — 547 thousand tons,

•

Ontario — 154 thousand tons and

•

Saskatchewan — 634 thousand tons.

When the volume is harvested, we pay the province for that volume at stumpage rates set by the government. The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any profit from harvesting the log through to converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our Wood Products segment.

A small amount of harvested volumes are sold to unaffiliated customers.

HOW MUCH WE HARVEST

Our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of long-term economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets. This is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity.

REAL ESTATE, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Our Real Estate & ENR segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization (AVO) process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets, such as oil, natural gas, minerals and wind and solar resources.

WHAT WE DO

Real Estate

Properties that exhibit higher use value than as commercial timberlands are monetized by our Real Estate business over time. We analyze our existing U.S. timberland holdings using a process we call AVO. We start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market. The assessment includes demographics, infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland. Attributes can evolve over time, and accordingly, the assignment of value and opportunity can change. We continually revisit our AVO assessment of all of our timberland acres.

These properties are acres we expect to sell for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes over time. We will entitle a small amount of acres to support development. Development, outside of entitlement activities, is typically performed by third parties. Some of our real estate activities are conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiary.

Occasionally, we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence, and we can capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands. These transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands.

The timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the ability of buyers to obtain financing, the number of competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the Northern states), the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of the harvesting activities, and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding. In any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.

Energy and Natural Resources

We focus on maximizing potential opportunities for oil, natural gas, construction materials, industrial minerals, coal, renewable energy and rights of way easements on our timberlands portfolio and retained mineral interests.

As the owner of mineral rights and interests, we typically do not invest in development or operations but instead enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties. Our primary sources of revenue are:

•

rentals and royalties from the exploration, extraction, production and sale of aggregates and industrial minerals, oil and natural gas, coal and wind energy production;

•

rental payments from, or sale of, communication, energy and transportation rights of way; and

•

the occasional sale of mineral assets.

We generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage. Some Energy and Natural Resources activities are conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiary.

Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources Sources of Revenue

WHERE WE DO IT

Our Real Estate business identifies opportunities to realize premium value for our U.S. owned timberland acreage.

Our significant Energy and Natural Resources revenue sources are located in Oregon, South Carolina and Georgia (construction material royalties); the Gulf South (oil and natural gas royalties); and West Virginia (coal reserves).

NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses. We also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality, including the protection of wildlife and water quality. Changes in law and regulation, or certification standards, can significantly affect our business.

REGULATIONS AFFECTING FORESTRY PRACTICES

In the United States, regulations established by federal, state and local government agencies to protect water quality, wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands. Forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include:

•

limits on the size of clearcuts,

•

requirements that some timber be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat,

•

regulations regarding construction and maintenance of forest roads,

•

rules requiring reforestation following timber harvest and

•

various related permit programs.

Each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water-quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act, protect fish and wildlife habitats, human health, or achieve other public policy objectives.

In Canada, our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces. All forest operations in Canada are subject to:

•

forest practices and environmental regulations and

•

license requirements established by contract between us and the relevant province designed to:

-

protect environmental values and

-

encourage other stewardship values.

In Canada, 21 member companies of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), including Weyerhaeuser

’

s Canadian subsidiary, announced in May 2010 the signing of a Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) with nine environmental organizations. The CBFA applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to FPAC members and, when fully implemented, was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of Canada

’

s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk, in particular, woodland caribou. While the CBFA mandate came to an end in 2017, CBFA signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments, and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the CBFA.

ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS

In the United States, a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws, including but not limited to:

•

the northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest;

•

several freshwater mussel and sturgeon species; and

•

the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, American burying beetle and Northern long-eared bat in the South or Southeast.

Additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies. In addition, significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate "critical habitat" for ESA-listed species, and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time. Such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options. Restrictions on timber harvests can result from:

•

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species;

•

regulatory actions by federal or state agencies to protect these species and their habitat; and

•

citizen suits under the ESA.

Such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general. To date, we do not believe that these measures have had, and we do not believe that in


they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of U.S. competitors.

In Canada:

•

The federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for their critical habitat. Pursuant to SARA, Environment Canada continues to identify and assess species deemed to be at risk and their critical habitat.

•

In October 2012, the Canadian Minister of the Environment released a strategy for the recovery of the boreal population of woodland caribou under the SARA. The population and distribution objectives for boreal caribou across Canada are to (1) maintain the current status of existing, self-sustaining local caribou populations and (2) stabilize and achieve self-sustaining status for non-self-sustaining local caribou populations. Critical habitat for boreal caribou is identified for all boreal caribou ranges, except for northern Saskatchewan’s Boreal Shield range (SK1) where additional information is required for that population. Species assessment and recovery plans are developed in consultation with aboriginal communities and stakeholders.

•

In 2017, the Provinces were required to update the federal government on any progress associated with their draft caribou range plans. These draft plans will be further evaluated in 2019, and any additional information on potential effects to forest harvest operations will be released.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



The identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may, over time, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in Canada. To date, we do not believe that these Canadian measures have had, and we do not believe that in


they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of Canadian competitors.

FOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS

We operate in North America under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative

®

(SFI). This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values. SFI is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of:

•

conservation organizations,

•

academia,

•

the forest industry and

•

large and small forest landowners.

Ongoing compliance with SFI may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas. There is also competition from other private certification systems, primarily the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system. Certain features of the FSC system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management. Because of the considerable variation in FSC standards, and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied, if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than SFI-certified forests, we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels.

WHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US

The regulatory and non-regulatory forest management programs described above have:

•

increased our operating costs;

•

resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands;

•

contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand;

•

sometimes made it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances; and

•

potentially encouraged further reductions in the use of, or substitution of other products for, lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and plywood.

We believe that these regulations and programs have not had, and in


will not have, a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.

CANADIAN ABORIGINAL RIGHTS

Many of the Canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada. Most of British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved. On June 26, 2014 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in Nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1,900 square kilometers in B.C. This was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples. Many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C., other provinces and Canada.

Final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in:

•

additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber,

•

potential increase in operating costs and

•

effect on timber supply and prices in Canada.

We believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in


, although they may have such an effect in the future. In 2008, FPAC, of which we are a member, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Assembly of First Nations, under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen Canada

’

s forest sector through economic-development initiatives and business investments, strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skill-development opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth.

POLLUTION-CONTROL REGULATIONS

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including federal, state, provincial and local pollution controls.

These laws and regulations, as well as market demands, impose controls with regard to:

•

air, water and land;

•

solid and hazardous waste management;

•

waste disposal;

•

remediation of contaminated sites; and

•

the chemical content of some of our products.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Compliance with these laws, regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws, regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects.

Our capital projects typically are designed to:

•

enhance safety,

•

extend the life of a facility,

•

lower costs and improve efficiency,

•

improve reliability,

•

increase capacity,

•

facilitate raw material changes and handling requirements,

•

increase the economic value of assets or products, and

•

comply with regulatory standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

We are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites. Of these sites:

•

we may have the sole obligation to remediate,

•

we may share that obligation with one or more parties,

•

several parties may have joint and several obligations to remediate and

•

we may have been named as a potentially responsible party for contaminated sites, including those designated as U

.

S

.

Superfund sites.

Our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on the:

•

quantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site; and

•

number and economic viability of the other responsible parties.

We spent approximately

$13 million

in


and expect to spend approximately

$6 million

in


on environmental remediation of these sites.

It is our policy to accrue for environmental-remediation costs when we:

•

determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and

•

can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation.

We currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of

$62 million

. Based on currently available information and analysis, remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to

$126 million

. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN THE U.S.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations for air emissions from:

•

wood products facilities and

•

industrial boilers.

These regulations cover:

•

hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT); and

•

controls and/or monitoring for pollutants that contribute to smog, haze and more recently, greenhouse gases.

Between 2011 and 2015, the EPA issued three related portions of new MACT standards for industrial boilers and process heaters. In July 2016, a court decision was issued that requires EPA to re-issue certain of the emissions standards. Some of these re-issued emissions standards will be applicable to a small number of our wood products mills. Because we do not know specifically how or when the EPA will implement the final court decision, we cannot predict whether or when the emission standard revisions may have a material effect on regulatory compliance costs at our mills. We do not expect any material expenditures in 2019 necessary to comply with MACT standards.

The EPA must still promulgate supplemental MACT standards for plywood, lumber and composite wood products facilities.

We cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the EPA because final rules have not been promulgated.

In 2010, the EPA issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds. On June 23, 2014, the US Supreme Court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from non-greenhouse gas pollutants. As a result of this Supreme Court ruling, EPA proposed a new regulation in 2016 to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the non-greenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance. EPA to date has not finalized this regulation. The effect of the Supreme Court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations.

In 2015, the EPA issued an extensive regulatory program for new and existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity. EPA also proposed additional, supplemental regulations related to how states and federal agencies may implement the requirements finalized in 2015. Subsequent actions include in 2016 a US Supreme Court stay of the 2015 rule pending resolution of lower court challenges to the rule, in 2017 the withdrawal by EPA of the proposed supplemental regulations and a proposal to rescind the 2015 final rule, and in 2018 an EPA proposal of a substantially different replacement rule. Depending on the final outcomes, this regulatory program potentially will have indirect effects on our operations, such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate. We continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory development but are not able to predict whether the regulations, when complete and implemented, will have a material effect on our operations.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



We use significant biomass for energy production at our mills. EPA is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions.

The effect of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules, as well as recent court decisions, on our operations remains uncertain.

To address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant, we:

•

closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change;

•

adopted in 2006, as part of the company's sustainability program, a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000, assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations;

•

determined to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gas-neutral, biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels; and

•

reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 44 percent considering changes in the asset portfolio according to 2017 data, compared to our 2000 baseline.

Additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include:

•

policy proposals by federal or state governments regarding regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,

•

Congressional legislation regulating or taxing greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years and

•

establishment of a multistate or federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses.

We believe these developments have not had, and in


will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations.

REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA

In addition to existing provincial air quality regulations, the Canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system (AQMS) as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada. The federal proposed AQMS includes:

•

ambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country;

•

a framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions;

•

regional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders;

•

industrial sector based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada; and

•

improved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

In 2016, Environment Canada released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, a "Greenhouse Gas Emission Framework." The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries, including ours.

All Canadian provincial governments:

•

have greenhouse gas reporting requirements,

•

are working on reduction strategies and

•

together with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards.

In addition, British Columbia has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation.

We believe these measures have not had, and in


will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.

REGULATION OF WATER

In the U.S., as a result of litigation under the federal Clean Water Act, additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides, including herbicides, on timberlands. Those permits have entailed payment of additional costs. In 2015, federal regulatory agencies adopted rules that potentially expand the definition of waters subject to federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction, which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestry-related activities and entail additional costs for Weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the U.S. Those rules were challenged in various federal courts by numerous parties and states, and a nationwide injunction was issued against the rule by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but was dissolved in 2018 due to action by the U.S. Supreme Court. Other injunctions still block the rule in several states. In January 2018, federal agencies took regulatory action to further delay the 2015 rules from going into effect until February 2020; however, that action was enjoined in September 2018 by a South Carolina court. Challenges to the substance of the 2015 rule are being pursued in other pending cases challenging the 2015 rules. Meanwhile, the federal agencies have proposed repeal of the 2015 rules entirely and replacement of them with a new rule, which is now open for public comment. We are not able to predict the ultimate resolution of these pending legal and regulatory actions.

In 2016, Washington State Department of Ecology (WA DOE) adopted human health-based water quality criteria. The EPA subsequently promulgated its own water quality standards for Washington state for the protection of human health for certain pollutants. It is unclear what effect, if any, these rules will have on our manufacturing operations in Washington state.

In addition, in 2013, amendments to the Canadian Federal Fisheries Act came into force. These amendments changed the focus from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties. We expect further changes to these regulations subsequent to review and regulatory consultations that took place in 2016, but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect, if any, on our operations.

We believe the above developments have not had, and in


will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN POLLUTION REGULATION

State governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may set:

•

limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water; or

•

additional requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants.

It is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state TMDL programs until a specific TMDL is promulgated.

In Canada, various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use, quality and management. Recent areas of focus include water allocation, regional watershed protection, protection of drinking water, water pricing and a national water quality index.

RISK FACTORS

We are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flows and the price of our common stock.

You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report, particularly in

Our Business - Who We Are

,

Forward-Looking Statements

and

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.

The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical.

The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which consequently affect our sales and profitability. End-user demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as on local economic conditions. Current economic conditions in the United States reflect growth enhanced by tax cuts passed in 2018, the effect of which may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and other factors in 2019. Global economic conditions reflect volatile and sporadic growth in emerging countries and uncertainty over international trade. The length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time, both by market and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volume and reduced margins.

COMMODITY PRODUCTS

Many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.

Because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. In addition, prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material, labor (including contract labor) and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. Both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control.

INDUSTRY SUPPLY OF LOGS AND WOOD PRODUCTS

Excess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins.

Our industry may increase harvest levels, which could lead to an oversupply of logs. Wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity, which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products. Any increase of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins.

HOMEBUILDING MARKET AND ECONOMIC RISKS

High unemployment, low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our business is dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market. Demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. Other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes, and hence demand for our products, include factors such as limited wage growth, increases in non-mortgage consumer debt, any weakening in consumer confidence, and any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses.

Homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates, changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market.

Access to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the U.S. housing market. Generally, increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing, which could negatively affect demand for housing and, in turn, negatively affect demand for our wood products. After an extended period during which the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at historically low levels, it began raising rates again in 2016 and continued through 2018. The number and extent of further rate increases is uncertain.

Credit requirements were severely tightened, and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were severely reduced, during the most recent recession and ensuing credit crisis. Although the availability of credit has improved modestly since that time, the demand for new homes could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason.

The liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, has been critical to the housing market. Any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing. Whether resulting from direct increases in borrowing rates, tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry, a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our products.

Changes in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual

’

s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct. These and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments, may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products.

TRANSPORTATION

We depend on third parties for transportation services and any disruptions in the availability of transportation or increases in transportation costs could materially adversely affect our business and operations.

Our business depends heavily on the availability of third-party service providers for the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber; we are therefore materially affected by the availability and cost of these services. Any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers, including without limitation the cost of fuel or labor, could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us, as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether.

Our third-party transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure, labor issues and natural disasters. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to timely deliver our products, including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills, could harm our supply chain, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our reputation.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

MANAGING COMMERCIAL TIMBERLANDS RISKS

Our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our primary assets are our timberlands. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations, and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands. Other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, severe weather and other natural disasters. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited. As is common in the forest products industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands. Our revenues, net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. Therefore, if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time, or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur, we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations.

Our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another. Future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas, which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints, availability of logging contractors and other factors beyond our control.

Timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish, wildlife, water and other resources. Regulations, re-interpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs. Examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened, endangered and “at-risk” species, harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, state forestry practices laws, laws protecting aboriginal rights, and other similar regulations.

Our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates, which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.

Whether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions, we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories. These include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested, timber growth rates and end-product yields. Timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property. These estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests, revenues and expected cash flows. While the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer it, growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain. If these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised, which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected.

Our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber.

A variety of factors affect prices for timber, including available supply, changes in economic conditions that affect demand, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and pest infestation, and other factors. These factors vary by region, by timber type (i.e., sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and by species.

Timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local, national and international level. The closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region, and therefore pricing. For example, as the demand for paper continues to decline, closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips. Another example involves our export of logs to Asia. While recent demand from Asian markets has remained steady, some Asian markets, particularly in China, have a history of significant volatility. A decrease in demand for logs from one or more Asian markets could have a negative effect on log and lumber prices.

Timber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local, national and international level. Our timberland ownership is concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington. In some of these states, much

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



of the timberland is privately owned. Increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that moderates such price increases. In western states such as Oregon and Washington, where a greater proportion of timberland is government-owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices. Any decrease in the demand from our log export markets could also result in significant downward pressure on timber prices, particularly in the western region. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as pest infestations, fires or other natural disasters.

Timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio.

Our real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future. As the owner and manager of approximately

12.2 million

acres of timberlands, we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments. A downturn in the real estate industry generally, or the timber or forest products industries specifically, could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations. Such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products, as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices. These risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings.

MANUFACTURING AND SELLING WOOD PRODUCTS RISKS

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.

Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

unscheduled maintenance outages;

•

prolonged power failures;

•

equipment failure;

•

chemical spill or release;

•

explosion of a boiler;

•

fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or catastrophes, affecting the production of goods or the supply of raw materials (including fiber);

•

the effect of drought or reduced rainfall on water supply;

•

labor difficulties;

•

disruptions in transportation or transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, tunnels, shipping and port facilities;

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•

cyber attack;

•

governmental regulations; and

•

other operational problems.

We cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage. If one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Additionally, we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, equipment failures and boiler explosions. Such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages.

Some of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.

Our products compete with non-fiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. If use of these or other alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected.

Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.

Our results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. Some of our wood products, such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board, are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. If pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higher-priced, higher-value products, or if we are not successful in implementing price increases, or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higher-priced products, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins.

We face intense competition in our markets; any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We compete with North American producers and, for some of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than do we. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Another form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products; customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects.

We have adopted the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities, both from our timberlands and from third-party suppliers. Some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards, including standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). If customer preference for a sustainability standard other than SFI

increases, or if the SFI

standard falls into disfavor

,

there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations, such as reducing harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.

Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.

We rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements, cost-reduction programs or hedging arrangements.

RISKS RELATED TO CAPITAL MARKETS

CAPITAL MARKETS

Deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital.

Challenging market conditions could impair the company

’

s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other effects, reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Likewise, our customers and suppliers may be unable to raise capital to fund their operations, which could, in turn, adversely affect their ability to purchase products or sell products to us.

CREDIT RATINGS

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading our current rating, as well as placing the company on a "watch list" for possible future ratings actions. Any downgrade of our credit rating, or decision by a rating agency to place us on a "watch list" for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

Access to capital required for our operations may be costly or impaired.

Our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

While we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, or at all, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

We will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.

We have manufacturing operations in Canada. We are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly relative to the Canadian dollar, euro, yuan and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen. Changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volume, margins and results of operations.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.

We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

•

air emissions,

•

wastewater discharges,

•

harvesting and other silvicultural activities,

•

forestry operations and endangered species habitat protection,

•

surface water management,

•

the storage, usage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,

•

the cleanup of contaminated sites,

•

landfill operation and closure obligations,

•

building codes, and

•

health and safety matters.

We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.

As the owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs.

We also lease some of our properties to third-party operators for the purpose of exploring, extracting, developing and producing oil, gas, rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments. These activities are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. These operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other chemicals into the air, soil or water. Generally, these third-party operators indemnify us against any such liability, and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them. However, if for any reason our third-party operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation, or if the required liability insurance were not in effect, then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with

environmental liability caused by such third-party operators.

Any material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition.

We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. We expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.

Changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international, U.S. federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities.

There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S. and Canada, some of these proposals would (and have in some Canadian provinces) regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy. Climate change effects, if they occur, and governmental initiatives, laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time. However, it is possible that legislation or government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could adversely affect our operations. For example, such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials. Because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials, these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.

LEGAL MATTERS

We are involved in various environmental, regulatory, product liability and other legal matters, disputes and proceedings that, if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

We are, from time to time, involved in a number of legal matters, disputes and proceedings (legal matters), some of which involve on-going litigation. These include, without limitation, legal matters involving environmental clean-up and remediation, warranty and non-warranty product liability claims, regulatory issues, contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters. In some cases, all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance; in other cases, any such losses will not be covered.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



The outcome, costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved, and any related insurance recoveries, cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosures in

Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

and

Note 20: Income Taxes

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contain management

’

s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected. It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us, and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages. Any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.

REIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders.

In any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:

•

We would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income.

•

We would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at applicable corporate rates.

•

We also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified.

Certain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the

company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Accordingly, the harvesting and sale of logs, the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate, and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs), the net income of which is subject to corporate-level tax, because such activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income and thus could constitute “prohibited transactions.” Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. By conducting our business in this manner, we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the IRS were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the REIT constituted prohibited transactions, we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities.

The extent of our use of our TRSs may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.

We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. The use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs, production and sale of wood products, and the development and sale of certain higher and better use (HBU) property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level income tax. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we use them.

We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs.

The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRSs and other non-real estate income.

This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and TRS income that is not distributed to the REIT will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.

Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate

.

Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT but would be subject to corporate income taxes. If capital gains are retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be notified, and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution, with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the REIT. Accordingly, we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.

Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.

Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.

IMPORT/EXPORT TAXES AND DUTIES

We may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties or tariffs on our imported products.

We export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, and our ability to do so profitably is affected by U.S. and foreign trade policy. International trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an International Trade Court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries.

U.S. international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. We could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs, duties, taxes, customs or dispute settlement terms. To the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business.

OUR MERGER WITH PLUM CREEK TIMBER COMPANY, INC.

We could incur substantial U.S. federal tax liability in connection with our merger with Plum Creek.

On February 19, 2016, Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. merged with and into Weyerhaeuser Company, with Weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving company. Both companies have operated in a manner intended to qualify them as “REITs” for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. See “REIT Status and Tax Implications” above for a description of the consequences of our failure to maintain REIT status. However, even if we have operated in a manner that allows us to retain our REIT status, if Plum Creek were deemed to have lost its REIT status for a taxable year before the merger or the taxable year in which the merger occurred, we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital. In addition, if the merger were determined not to qualify as a tax-free merger, we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the company's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

OTHER RISKS

CYBERSECURITY

We rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A security failure of that technology could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.

We use information systems to carry out our operational activities, maintain our business records, collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, other proprietary and personally identifiable information. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. We and our service providers employ what we believe are reasonably adequate security measures, but notwithstanding these efforts, our systems could be compromised as a result of a cyber incident, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption. If by any cause our systems or information resources were compromised, or if our data were destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our business operations could be negatively affected. Additionally, we could suffer significant loss or incur significant liability, including: damage to our reputation; loss of customer confidence or goodwill; and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners, or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings, by affected individuals, business partners or regulators.

PENSION PLAN LIABILITY

Investment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected, or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.

A portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans. Although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits. Requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. Fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements.  It is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. We cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions. See

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information about these plans, including funding status.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Our business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include, among others: optimizing cash flow through operational excellence; reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure; and innovating in higher-margin products

.

We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.

We intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant. As with any investment, our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations,

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.

WORKFORCE

Our business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel.

Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop senior management, operations management and other key personnel. Our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit, retain, and develop such personnel, or if there were to occur any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits.

Availability of Independent Contractors

We use independent third-party contract loggers and haulers to deliver our logs to our customers. As a result of the weak business conditions in the timber business that persisted for several years, there are fewer of these contractors available in certain markets to harvest and deliver logs. This shortage in logging and hauling contractors has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and, in some cases, the general availability of these contractors. Any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of logging and hauling contractors.  This, in turn, could increase the cost of log supply and delivery, or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market.

STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY

The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.

The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;

•

our growth rate and our competitors

’

growth rates;

•

general economic conditions;

•

conditions in the financial markets;

•

market interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments;

•

general perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices, and currencies;

•

changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;

•

sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;

•

sales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock;

•

changes in accounting principles; and

•

changes in tax laws and regulations.

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance.

Some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

The demand for grade logs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and OSB as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood.

Due to the partial government shutdown that occurred through late January 2019, full-year 2018 housing data is unavailable, however, for the January 2018 through November 2018 period, housing starts were 1.18 million total units, which is 5 percent above the total of 1.12 units for the same period in 2017 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Single family units totaled 825 thousand compared to 794 thousand in 2017, a 4 percent increase. Multifamily starts were 354 thousand units for the first 11 months of 2018, which is 8 percent higher than 2017 for the same period. We continue to expect improving U.S. housing starts and anticipate a level of approximately 1.30 million units in 2019 which would be a 3 percent gain over 2018, assuming the year to date gains continue into December. We attribute this continued improvement primarily to ongoing employment growth, strong consumer confidence and mortgage rates, which have stabilized and declined since peaking in late 2018 and remain affordable on a historic basis.

According to the Joint Center for Housing of Harvard University, the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) projects that the year-over-year increase in residential remodeling expenditures reached 7.2 percent in 2018 and is expected to average 6.5 percent in 2019, with expenditure growth tapering through the year and reaching the long term average level of 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2019.

In U.S. wood product markets, prices in 2018 were mixed, rising the first half of the year to post record levels in May and June, only to fall sharply in third and fourth quarter 2018, as supply issues related to transportation eased and producers increased output in response to high prices. According to Random Lengths, the framing lumber composite averaged $459/MBF in 2018, an 11 percent increase over 2017. According to Forest Economic Advisors, LLC, U.S. lumber consumption is expected to grow at a 3.5 percent rate in 2019, however, due to declines forecast in off-shore export volumes and increases in off-shore imports, the increase in overall demand on North American mills is expected to rise by 2.5 percent over 2018. Log markets in the west were consistent with wood products manufacturing, exhibiting strong demand and pricing in the first half followed by slower demand and weaker market prices for western logs in the second half of 2018. In the south, log supplies kept pace with demand, leaving prices flat throughout 2018.

Log inventories in Chinese ports decreased 0.9 percent in December 2018 compared to November 2018 as reported by International Wood Markets China Bulletin. While the decline in overall volume was slight, there was a greater decline in North American Hemlock and Douglas fir volumes. These species were 5.9 percent lower in December 2018 compared to November 2018 which has positive implications for demand at the start of 2019 as suppliers will need to re-build depleted inventories. Total North American volumes increased in 2018 by 3 percent over 2017 despite retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Chinese government against U.S. imports. In addition, exchange rates also have an effect on our export business to China. A weaker yuan relative to the U.S. dollar reduces the competitiveness of U.S. logs relative to those imported from other countries whose currencies have not appreciated in a similar manner. During 2018, the yuan weakened relative to the U.S. dollar, which affects the competitiveness of our export logs to China.

In Japan, housing starts for November year to date for 2018 were down 2.7 percent from the same period in 2017 while the key Post and Beam segment was 0.8 percent lower in the first 11 months of 2018 compared to 2017.

We expect demand from China and Japan in 2019 to be similar to demand experienced in 2018.

Our Real Estate & ENR segment is affected by the health of the U.S. economy and especially the U.S. housing sector of the economy. According to the Realtors Land Institute (RLI) of the National Association of Realtors, the dollar volume of rural properties sold, including timber, grew 2 percent in 2018, and per acre prices were also up 2 percent on average. Additionally, RLI expects these trends to continue with prices and volumes of land transactions forecast to rise 3 percent in 2019.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



SOFTWOOD LUMBER AGREEMENT

We operate a total of 19 softwood lumber mills with a total capacity of approximately

5 billion

board feet. Three of these mills, located in Canada, produce approximately 900 million board feet annually, and sell products in Canada, Asia, and the U.S.

In April 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement countervailing duties (CVD) on Canadian softwood lumber shipments to the U.S at the rate of 19.88 percent with a 90 day retroactive period. The preliminary countervailing duties were suspended in August 2017, at which time we effectively stopped accruing for the expense. The suspension of the countervailing duties was set to last until the US International Trade Commission reached its final determination of injury, which was issued in December 2017.

In June 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a preliminary determination that it would implement anti-dumping duties (AD) on Canadian softwood lumber shipments to the U.S. at the rate of 6.87 percent with a 90 day retroactive period.

Affirmative final determinations by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the US International Trade Commission (USITC) in December 2017 issued CVD and AD duty orders on certain softwood lumber products from Canada. Based on these determinations, the CVD rate applicable to Weyerhaeuser is 14.19 percent and is assessed on entries of softwood lumber from Canada for consumption on or after April 28, 2017. The AD rate applicable to Weyerhaeuser is 6.04 percent and is assessed on entries of softwood lumber from Canada for consumption on or after June 30, 2017.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have expensed CVD and AD duties at the final published rates totaling

$21 million

and

$7 million

, respectively. These costs are recorded in "Costs of sales" within the Wood Products segment.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:

•

Sales realizations refer to net selling prices — this includes selling price plus freight minus normal sales deductions;

•

Net contribution to earnings refers to earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders before interest expense and income taxes.

Our merger with Plum Creek during first quarter 2016 affected the comparability of our consolidated operating results with 2016. Our results do not include pre-merger results of Plum Creek operations from January 1, 2016 through February 19, 2016.

Summary of Financial Results

COMPARING


WITH


Net Sales

Net sales increased

$280 million

—

4 percent

— primarily due to:

•

Wood Products segment net sales to unaffiliated customers increased

$281 million

, primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across all product lines; and

•

Real Estate & ENR segment net sales to unaffiliated customers increased

$26 million

primarily attributable to increased acres sold.

These increases were offset by a decrease in Timberlands segment net sales to unaffiliated customers by

$27 million

, primarily attributable to decreased revenue resulting from the divestiture of our Uruguayan operations in third quarter 2017, partially offset by an increase in Western log sales realizations.

Costs of Sales

Costs of sales increased

$294 million

—

6 percent

— primarily due to increased log and fiber costs within our Wood Products and Timberlands segments as well as an increase in acres sold coupled with higher per acre basis of real estate sold within our Real Estate and ENR segment. Refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our

•

$290 million

decrease in charges for product remediation; and

•

$147 million

decrease in charges related to a noncash pretax impairment in 2017, with no similar charges in 2018. This impairment was a result of our agreement to sell our Uruguayan operations, as announced during June 2017 (refer to

Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

).

These increases were partially offset by the following:

•

$99 million

gain recorded in fourth quarter 2017 that did not occur in 2018 as a result of the sale of land in our Southern timberlands region to Twin Creeks (refer to

Note 9: Related Parties

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details);

•

$37 million decrease in environmental remediation insurance recoveries received; and

•

$14 million

decreased consolidated gross margin, as described above.

Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased

$166 million

—

29 percent

•

a

$263 million

increase to operating income, as described above;

•

a $75 million decrease in income tax expense; and

•

an $18 million decrease in interest expense, net of capitalized interest.

These increases to net earnings were partially offset by a

$200 million

decrease due to a noncash pretax settlement charge related to our U.S. qualified pension plan lump sum offer (refer to

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

COMPARING


WITH


Net Sales

Net sales increased

$831 million

—

13 percent

— primarily due to:

•

Wood Products net sales to unaffiliated customers increased

$640 million

primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across all product lines, as well as increased sales volumes within our oriented strand board, engineered I-joists, medium density fiberboard, and our engineered solid section product lines. Additionally, upon completion of the sales of our former Cellulose Fibers businesses, chips previously sold to Cellulose Fibers are now sales to unaffiliated customers. Refer to

Note 4: Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details regarding these divestitures.

•

Timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers increased

$137 million

, which is primarily attributable to increased Southern and Other (includes our Canadian operations and timberlands included in the Twin Creeks Venture) delivered log sales volumes, as well as, an increase in Western log sales prices.

•

Real Estate & ENR net sales to unaffiliated customers increased

$54 million

attributable to an increase in timberlands acres sold in Real Estate and an increase in royalties.

Operating Income

Operating income increased

$309 million

—

38 percent

— primarily due to:

•

an increase to consolidated gross margin of

$513 million

, as described above;

•

an increase in other operating income, net of

$75 million

, which is primarily attributable to:

–

a

$99 million

gain recorded in fourth quarter 2017 as a result of the sale of land in our Southern timberlands region to Twin Creeks (refer to

Note 9: Related Parties

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details);

–

a $42 million benefit related to environmental remediation insurance recoveries received in 2017; and

–

a $44 million decrease in gains on disposition of nonstrategic assets, primarily attributable to a $36 million pretax gain recognized in the first quarter of 2016 on the sale of our Federal Way, Washington headquarters campus (refer to

Note 20: Other Operating Costs (Income), Net

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information).

These increases were partially offset by the following:

•

the addition of

$290 million

in charges (recoveries) for product remediation, net in 2017, as there were no similar charges during 2016. Refer to

Note 19: Charges (Recoveries) for Product Remediation, Net

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information.

•

a

$24 million

increase in charges for integration and restructuring, closures and asset impairments, which is primarily attributable to a

$147 million

noncash impairment charge recognized during second quarter 2017 in relation to the divestiture of our Uruguayan operations.

This was partially offset by a

$112 million

decrease in charges related to our merger with Plum Creek. Refer to

Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructurings, Closures and Asset Impairments

Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources

.

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources

The timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including:

•

the general state of the economy,

•

demand in local real estate markets,

•

the ability to obtain entitlements,

•

the ability of buyers to obtain financing,

•

the number of competing properties listed for sale,

•

the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the northern states),

•

the plans of adjacent landowners,

•

our expectations of future price appreciation,

•

the timing of harvesting activities, and

•

the availability of government and not-for-profit funding (especially for conservation sales).

COMPARING


WITH


Net Sales

Net sales increased

$640 million

—

15 percent

— primarily due to:

•

a $219 million increase in structural lumber sales, attributable to a 13 percent increase in average sales realizations, partially offset by a 1 percent decrease in sales volumes;

•

a $197 million increase in oriented strand board sales, attributable to a 26 percent increase in average sales realizations as well as a 1 percent increase in sales volumes;

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



•

a $75 million increase in other products produced, primarily attributable to increased chip sales. Chips were previously sold to our former Cellulose Fibers segment and were therefore considered intersegment sales until the sale of our Cellulose Fibers businesses which occurred in the second half of 2016. Upon completion of these divestitures, chips sold to those businesses were considered sales to unaffiliated customers. (Refer to

Note 4: Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details regarding these divestitures.);

•

a $50 million increase in engineered solid section, primarily attributable to an 8 percent increase in sales volumes as well as a 3 percent increase in average sales realizations; and

•

a $46 million increase in engineered I-joists, primarily attributable to a 13 percent increase in sales volume as well as a 3 percent increase in average sales realizations.

Costs of Sales

Costs of sales increased

$192 million

—

5 percent

— primarily attributable to an overall increase in sales volumes, as discussed above. This increase was offset by the mix of products sold during 2017 compared to 2016.

Operating Income and Net Contribution to Earnings

Operating income and net contribution to earnings increased

$57 million

—

11 percent

— primarily due to increased gross margin, as discussed above. This was partially offset by:

•

the

$290 million

addition of charges (recoveries) for product remediation, net in 2017, as there were no similar charges during 2016 (refer to

Note 19: Charges (Recoveries) for Product Remediation, Net

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information).

•

a $68 million decrease in intersegment sales in 2017 compared to 2016, which is primarily attributable to decreased intersegment chip sales. Prior to our divestitures of our former Cellulose Fibers business, which occurred in the second half of 2016, chips sold to these businesses were considered intersegment sales. Upon completion of these divestitures, chips sold to our former Cellulose Fibers businesses were considered sales to unaffiliated customers.

•

a $7 million increase in other operating costs, net, related to countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Refer to

Softwood Lumber Agreement

INCOME TAXES

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal corporate level income taxes on REIT taxable income that is distributed to shareholders. Historical distributions to shareholders, including amounts and tax characteristics, for the years ended December 31 are summarized in the table below.

The table below summarizes the items of tax preference for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes which have been apportioned to shareholders for the years ended December 31. The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) (see below) eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax adjustment to shareholders beginning with the 2018 tax year.

We are required to pay corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs, which includes our Wood Products segment and portions of our Timberlands and Real Estate & ENR segments' earnings. Our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our TRSs. Overall performance results for our business segments can be found in

Results of Operations/Timberlands

,

Results of Operations/Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources

, and

Results of Operations/Wood Products

.

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), was enacted. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, increased deductions for capital spending and limitations on interest expense deductions. The Tax Act does not affect our REIT status or the provisions that allow us to pay capital gain dividends to our shareholders.

As a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a tax expense of $74 million during 2017, which reduced our net deferred tax asset.

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years was:

•

$59 million

in


,

•

$134 million

in


and

•

$89 million

in


.

During 2018, we recorded a $41 million tax benefit related to contributions made to our pension plan and deducted on our 2017 U.S. federal tax return and a $21 million tax charge related to a tax settlement charge.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



During 2017, we recorded a $22 million tax benefit related to the repatriation of Canadian earnings.

During 2016, we recorded a $24 million tax charge related to the repatriation of Canadian earnings.

$300 million

voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan in third quarter 2018 (refer to

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

) as well as increased cash provided by business operations.

COMPARING


WITH


Net cash provided by our operations increased

$466 million

, primarily due to:

•

a decrease in cash paid for income taxes of $316 million, which is primarily attributable to taxes paid in connection with our divestitures of our former Cellulose Fibers businesses during 2016;

•

a decrease in cash paid for interest of $65 million corresponding with our decreased average indebtedness during 2017 compared to 2016; and

•

increased cash flows from our business segments.

These items were partially offset by:

•

decreased operating cash flows from discontinued operations of

$196 million

; and

•

an increase of $192 million in cash used for product remediation efforts (refer to

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:

•

historical experience and

•

assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:

•

pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•

potential impairments of long-lived assets; and

•

legal, environmental and product liability reserves.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key estimates we use in accounting for the plans include our:

•

fair value of our plan assets,

•

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and

•

discount rates.

At the end of every year, we review our key estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. We use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and postretirement expense for the following year. Actual experience that differs from our estimates or any changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. In some cases, primarily private equity and hedge funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, adjusted for known events occurring between the interim date and year-end.

We value the pension plan assets based on the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. These inputs are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows:

•

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.

•

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

•

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

Assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

In general, we value our pension plan assets, as follows:

•

cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market;

•

fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in the public market;

•

hedge funds, private equity funds and related fund units are valued based on the net asset value of the funds; and

•

derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative’s counterparty.

Assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased risk.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.

After considering available information at the end of 2016, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets from 9.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 8.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decision was based on a variety of factors, including the net compounded annual return achieved by our investment strategy and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets. We continued to use an assumption of 8.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of the end of 2018, we have begun implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that will more closely match the plan’s liability profile moving forward, resulting in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. With this change, we have determined that we will further reduce our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to

7.0 percent

for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Factors we considered include:

•

historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and

•

expected future performance of similar asset classes.

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans. Every 50 basis point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•

$14 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•

$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.

Discount Rates

The discount rate is used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. Our discount rates as of

December 31, 2018

, are:

•

4.4 percent

for our U.S. pension plans — compared with

3.7 percent

at

December 31, 2017

;

•

4.2 percent

for our U.S. postretirement plans — compared with

3.5 percent

at

December 31, 2017

;

•

3.7 percent

for our Canadian pension plans — compared with

3.5 percent

at

December 31, 2017

; and

•

3.7 percent

for our Canadian postretirement plans — compared with

3.4 percent

at

December 31, 2017

.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for


will be based on the

4.4 percent

and

4.2 percent

assumed discount rates for U.S. plans, respectively, and

3.7 percent

assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•

$15 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•

$5 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance ("a triggering event") indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded.  There were no significant triggering events during 2018.

If we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset groups. Key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material costs, and product sales.

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset)

.

Key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates, and probability of alternative outcomes.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

We record contingent liabilities when:

•

it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and

•

the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:

•

historical experience,

•

evaluations of relevant legal and environmental regulations,

•

judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and

•

consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. See

Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

We use Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. This measure should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons, and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold, pension and postretirement costs not allocated to business segments (primarily interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial loss and amortization of prior service cost/credit), and special items. Adjusted EBITDA excludes results from joint ventures.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Weyerhaeuser Company:

Opinion on the

Consolidated

Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies describe:

•

our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,

•

how we report our results,

•

changes in how we report our results and

•

how we account for various items.

OUR ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT)

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds.

We were no longer subject to the REIT built-in gains tax as of December 31, 2014. Our built-in gains tax period expired in 2015 due to a change in U.S. tax law that statutorily shortened the built-in gains tax period to 5 years from 10 years. This means we are no longer subject to federal corporate level income taxes on sales of REIT property that had a fair market value in excess of tax basis when we converted to a REIT on January 1, 2010. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which includes our Wood Products segment and portions of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources (Real Estate & ENR) segments.

HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

Our report includes:

•

consolidated financial statements,

•

our business segments,

•

estimates,

•

fair value measurements and

•

foreign currency translation.

Consolidated Financial Statements

Our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. They include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:

•

majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and

•

variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.

They do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.

Throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, unless specified otherwise, references to “Weyerhaeuser,” "the company," “we” and “our” refer to the consolidated company.

Our Business Segments

Reportable business segments are determined based on the company’s "management approach," as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 280, “Segment Reporting.” The management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.

We are principally engaged in:

•

growing and harvesting timber;

•

manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees;

•

maximizing the value of every acre we own through the sale of higher and better use (HBU) properties; and

•

monetizing reserves of minerals, oil, gas, coal, and other natural resources on our timberlands.

Our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.

Our Business Segments and Products

We also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. Because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.

Unallocated Items are gains or charges related to company level initiatives or previous businesses that are not allocated to our current business segments. They include a portion of items such as share-based compensation; pension and postretirement costs; elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO; foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates primarily related to our U.S. dollar denominated cash and debt balances that are held by our Canadian subsidiary; interest income and other and legacy obligations such as environmental remediation and workers compensation.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Estimates

We prepare our financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). This requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. The estimates and assumptions affect our:

•

reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;

•

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities; and

•

reported amounts of revenues and expenses.

While we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Fair Value Measurements

We use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:

•

long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;

•

pension plan assets measured at fair value; and

•

asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon its own market assumptions.

The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:

•

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.

•

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

•

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

Foreign Currency Translation

Local currencies are the functional currencies for most of our operations outside the U.S. We translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in two ways:

•

assets and liabilities — at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date; and

•

revenues and expenses — at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.

CHANGES IN HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

Changes in how we report our results come from:

•

reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and

•

accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance

Reclassifications

We have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our


reporting. This makes year-to-year comparisons easier. Our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Lease Recognition

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases and requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.

We adopted this standard on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition approach at the beginning of the adoption period through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. With this adoption approach, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. In addition, the standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The adoption resulted in the recognition of additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of less than 2 percent of our total assets on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

. These leases are primarily related to vehicles, equipment, office and warehouse leases disclosed in

Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

.

Reclassification of Certain Amounts from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows for the reclassification of certain income tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) between “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “Retained earnings.” This ASU provides that adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and assets related to a change in tax laws be included in “Income from continuing operations”, even in situations where the related items were originally recognized in “Other comprehensive income (loss).” The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this ASU is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the tax laws was recognized. We adopted this ASU during first quarter 2018 using the period of adoption method, which resulted in a reclassification of

$253 million

from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to "Retained earnings" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

due to changes in federal statutory and effective state rates. In general, tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the portfolio approach.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. We adopted ASU 2016-01 in first quarter 2018, which resulted in a reclassification of accumulated unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of

$9 million

from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to "Retained earnings" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date for an additional year. In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which does not change the core principle of the guidance; however, it does clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies two aspects of ASU 2014-09: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which amends ASU 2014-09 to provide improvements and practical expedients to the new revenue recognition model. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, which amends ASU 2014-09 for technical corrections and to correct for unintended application of the guidance. In February 2017, FASB issued ASU 2017-05, which clarifies the scope of ASC 610-20 and affects accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets.

We adopted this accounting standard update on January 1, 2018. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective transition method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application (cumulative effect method). We have adopted using the cumulative effect method. The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance does not materially affect our

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ITEMS

This section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:

•

capital investments,

•

financing our business and

•

operations.

ITEMS RELATED TO CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

Key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.

Property and Equipment

We maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis. Here is how we handle major items:

•

Improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.

•

Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.

•

Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.

•

We capitalize costs associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year. These roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.

•

Cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.

Timber and Timberlands

We carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. Depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested, lost as a result of casualty or sold.

Key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:

•

reforestation,

•

depletion and

•

forest management in Canada.

Reforestation.

Generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation. Generally, we expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. These costs include:

•

fertilization,

•

vegetation and insect control,

•

pruning and precommercial thinning,

•

property taxes and

•

interest.

Accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.

Timber depletion.

To determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. To determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:

•

regulatory and environmental constraints,

•

our management strategies,

•

inventory data improvements,

•

growth rate revisions and recalibrations and

•

known dispositions and inoperable acres.

In addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.

Depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:

•

future silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands

•

future reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest; and

•

future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest

We include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. As these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in the Costs of sales.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Forest Management in Canada.

We manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various Canadian provinces that are:

•

granted by the provincial governments;

•

granted for initial periods of


to


years; and

•

renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.

Calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:

•

varies from province to province,

•

is tied to product market pricing and

•

depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance ("a triggering event") indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. Impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value. Impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value based on:

•

appraisals,

•

market pricing of comparable assets,

•

discounted value of estimated cash flows from the asset and

•

replacement values of comparable assets.

ITEMS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS

Key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and concentration of risk.

Financial Instruments

We estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. The assumptions we use — including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows — can significantly affect our fair-value amounts. Our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of


days or less. We state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.

Accounts Payable

Our banking system replenishes our major bank accounts daily as checks we have issued are presented for payment. As a result, we may have negative book cash balances due to outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by the bank. These negative balances would be included in "Accounts payable" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

. Changes in these negative cash balances would be reported as financing activities in our

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

. We had

no

negative book cash balances as of

December 31, 2018

, and

December 31, 2017

.

Concentration of Risk

We disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. As of

December 31, 2018

, and

December 31, 2017

, no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales.

ITEMS RELATED TO OPERATIONS

Key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other postretirement plans and environmental remediation.

Revenue Recognition

Refer to

Note 3: Revenue Recognition

for detail on how we account for revenue.

Inventories

We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. LIFO — the last-in, first-out method — applies to major inventory products held at our U.S. domestic locations. We began to use the LIFO method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. Subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the FIFO — the first-in, first-out method — or moving average cost methods that have continued under those methods. The FIFO or moving average cost methods applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We classify shipping and handling costs in "Costs of sales" on our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions the company has taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. In accordance with the company’s accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:

•

future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and

•

operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

To measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:

•

determine when the differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and

•

use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.

Actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. The net periodic benefit cost includes:

•

cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees’ services rendered during the year;

•

interest cost of the obligations;

•

expected long-term return on plan assets;

•

gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;

•

amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive; and

•

amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses — generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year — over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.

Pension plans.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately half of our employees. Determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees, as follows:

•

Salaried employee benefits are based on each employee’s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.

•

Hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.

•

Union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.

We contribute to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. The funding standards for the plans are:

•

U.S. pension plans — according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; and

•

Canadian pension plans — according to the applicable provincial pension act and the Income Tax Act.

Postretirement benefits other than pensions.

We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

provides additional information about changes made in our postretirement benefit plans during


and


.

Environmental Remediation

We accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our business segments and how we account for those segments are discussed in

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Note 4: Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

for information regarding our discontinued operations and the segments affected.

NOTE 3:

REVENUE RECOGNITION

A majority of our revenue is derived from sales of delivered logs and manufactured wood products. We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the cumulative effect method. The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance did not materially affect our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

,

Consolidated Balance Sheet

, or

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

.

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS

A performance obligation, as defined in ASC Topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Performance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers’ mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales. Performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. The company has elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation.

Customers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. ASC Topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. Given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient.

Performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied.

CONTRACT ESTIMATES

Substantially all of the company’s performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. Therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above.

The transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. For the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. For wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates.

There are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business.

CONTRACT BALANCES

In general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. We generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. Contract asset and liability balances are immaterial.

For real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.

On September 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our Uruguay timberlands and manufacturing operations, to a consortium led by BTG Pactual's Timberland Investment Group (TIG), including other long-term investors, for

$403 million

of cash proceeds. Due to the impairment of our Uruguayan operations recorded during second quarter 2017 (refer to

Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

), no material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this sale.

The sale of our Uruguayan operations was not considered a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore did not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During 2016, we entered into three separate transactions to sell our Cellulose Fibers business. As a result of these transactions, the company recognized a pretax gain on disposition of

$789 million

and total cash proceeds of

$2.5 billion

in the second half of 2016. These transactions consisted of:

•

sale of our Cellulose Fibers liquid packaging board business to Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd for

$285 million

in cash proceeds, which closed on August 31, 2016;

•

sale of our Cellulose Fibers printing papers joint venture to One Rock Capital Partners, LLC for

$42 million

in cash proceeds, which closed on November 1, 2016; and

•

sale of our Cellulose Fibers pulp business to International Paper for

$2.2 billion

in cash proceeds, which closed on December 1, 2016.

The results of operations for our pulp and liquid packaging board businesses, along with our interest in our printing papers joint venture, were reclassified to discontinued operations during our 2016 reporting year. These results have been summarized in "Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" on our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

for each period presented. We did not reclassify our

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

to reflect discontinued operations. Cellulose Fibers was previously disclosed as a separate reportable business segment. Retained indirect corporate overhead costs previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers are now reported as part of Unallocated Items.

We used

$1.7 billion

of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our Cellulose Fibers business segment for repayment of debt during 2016.

The following table presents the components of the net gain on the divestiture of Cellulose Fibers:

MERGER WITH PLUM CREEK

On February 19, 2016, we merged with Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (Plum Creek). Plum Creek was a REIT that primarily owned and managed timberlands in the United States. Plum Creek also produced wood products, developed opportunities for mineral and other natural resource extraction, and sold real estate properties.

The acquisition of total assets of

$10.0 billion

was a noncash investing and financing activity comprised of

$6.4 billion

in equity consideration transferred and

$3.6 billion

of liabilities assumed.

HOW WE CALCULATE BASIC AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

"Basic earnings" per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares, including stock equivalent units where there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued.

"Diluted earnings" per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the sum of the:

•

weighted average number of our outstanding common shares and

•

the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.

Dilutive potential common shares may include:

•

outstanding stock options,

•

restricted stock units and

•

performance share units.

Calculation of Weighted Average Number of Outstanding Common Shares - Dilutive

We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. Share-based payment awards that are contingently issuable upon the achievement of specified performance or market conditions are included in our diluted earnings per share calculation in the period in which the conditions are satisfied.

SHARES EXCLUDED FROM DILUTIVE EFFECT

The following shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were either antidilutive or the required performance or market conditions were not met. Some or all of these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in future periods.

INVENTORIES

Inventories include raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods as well as materials and supplies.

Inventories as of the End of Our Last Two Years

LIFO — the last-in, first-out method — applies to major inventory products held at our U.S. domestic locations. The FIFO — the first-in, first-out method — or moving average cost methods apply to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories. If we used FIFO for all LIFO inventories, our stated inventories would have been higher by

$79 million

as of

December 31, 2018

RELATED PARTIES

This note provides details about and our transactions with related parties. For the years presented, our related parties have consisted of:

•

Real Estate Development Ventures,

•

our Twin Creeks Venture, and

•

special-purpose entities (SPEs).

REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT VENTURE

WestRock-Charleston Land Partners, LLC (WR-CLP) is a limited liability company which holds residential and commercial real estate development properties, currently under development (Class A Properties) and higher-value timber and development lands (Class B Properties) (referred to collectively as the Real Estate Development Ventures). The company uses the equity method for both its Class A and Class B interests of

3 percent

and

50 percent

, respectively. Our share of the equity earnings is included in the net contribution to earnings of our Real Estate & ENR segment.

We are not the primary beneficiary of WR-CLP and we are not committed to make any material capital contributions during the remaining term of the venture, which expires in


. We do not intend to provide any additional sources of financing for WR-CLP.

The carrying amount of our investment in WR-CLP was

$31 million

at

December 31, 2017

. During 2018, all remaining capital invested in WR-CLP was returned through distributions. At

December 31, 2018

, we no longer carry an investment related to WR-CLP. Additionally, we had a

$1 million

gain on investment from the joint venture during 2018. We record our share of net earnings on the investment within "Interest income and other" in our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

in the period which earnings are recorded by the affiliates.

TWIN CREEKS VENTURE

Ownership Redemption, Agreement Termination and Sale Recognition

During October 2017, we redeemed our

21 percent

ownership interest in the Twin Creeks Venture for

$108 million

in cash. We did not recognize a material gain or loss on the redemption of our ownership interest. The cash received was classified as a cash flow from investing activities in our

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

.

Effective

December 31, 2017

, we terminated the agreements under which we had managed the Twin Creeks timberlands. Following termination of these agreements, Weyerhaeuser has no further responsibilities or obligations related to the Twin Creeks Venture and our continuing involvement in the contributed timberlands ceased. In fourth quarter 2017, we recognized the sale of the original contribution of timberlands that occurred April 2016.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Changes in our deposit from contribution of timberlands to related party balance during


were as follows:

Formation and Operations

On April 1, 2016, we contributed approximately

260,000

acres of our Southern timberlands with an agreed-upon value of approximately

$560 million

to Twin Creeks Timber, LLC (Twin Creeks Venture), in exchange for cash of approximately

$440 million

and a

21 percent

ownership interest. The other members contributed cash of approximately

$440 million

for a combined

79 percent

ownership interest.

In conjunction with contributing to the venture, we entered into a separate agreement to manage the timberlands owned by the Twin Creeks Venture, including harvesting activities, marketing and log sales activities, and replanting and silviculture activities. This management agreement guaranteed the Twin Creeks Venture an annual return equal to

3 percent

of the contributed value of the managed timberlands in the form of minimum quarterly payments from Weyerhaeuser. This agreement also required us to annually distribute

75 percent

of any profits earned by us in excess of the minimum quarterly payments. The management agreement was cancellable at any time by Twin Creeks Timber, LLC, and otherwise would expire on April 1, 2019.

The guaranteed return that the management agreement required Weyerhaeuser to provide to the Twin Creeks Venture constituted continuing involvement in the timberlands that we contributed to the venture. This continuing involvement prohibited the recognition of the contribution as a sale and required application of the deposit method to account for the cash payment received. By applying the deposit method to the contribution of timberlands to the venture:

•

Our receipt of

$440 million

proceeds from the contribution of timberlands to the venture was recorded as a noncurrent liability.

•

The contributed timberlands continued to be reported within the "Timber and timberlands at cost, less depletion charged to disposals" on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.

•

No gain or loss was recognized related to the formation or redemption in our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

.

•

Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 did not reflect our

21 percent

ownership interest in the Twin Creeks Venture.

The receipt of

$440 million

in 2016 was classified as a cash flow from investing activities in our

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

. The cash proceeds from our contribution of timberlands were used for share repurchases.

Sale of Additional Timberlands to Twin Creeks

In conjunction with the redemption and termination discussed above, we also entered an agreement to sell

100,000

acres of Southern timberlands to Twin Creeks for

$203 million

. The sale, which included

80,000

acres of timberlands in Mississippi and

20,000

acres in Georgia, closed December 29, 2017. The sale resulted in a

$99 million

gain recognized during fourth quarter 2017.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

From 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands. As a result of these sales, buyer-sponsored and monetization special purpose entities (SPEs) were formed. We are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPEs involved in these transactions.

The assets of the buyer-sponsored SPEs are financial investments which consist of bank guarantees. These bank guarantees are in turn backed by bank notes, which are the liabilities of the monetization SPEs. Interest earned from the financial investments within the buyer-sponsored SPEs is used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding monetization SPE’s note.

We have an equity interest in the monetization SPEs, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored SPEs. The following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored SPEs and liabilities of monetization SPEs. However, because these SPEs are distinct legal entities:

•

Assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.

•

Liabilities of the SPEs are not our liabilities or obligations.

Our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

as of

December 31, 2018

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

This note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. The "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans" section of

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

provides information about employee eligibility for pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits, as well as how we account for the plans and benefits.

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WE SPONSOR

OVERVIEW OF PLANS

The defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the U.S. and Canada differ according to each country’s requirements. In the U.S., we have plans that qualify under the Internal Revenue Code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (nonqualified plans). In Canada, we have plans that are registered under the Income Tax Act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the Income Tax Act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). We also offer other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and Canada

,

including retiree medical and life insurance plans.

Actions to Reduce Pension Plan Obligations

During 2018, we offered select U.S. terminated vested plan participants the opportunity to elect an immediate lump sum distribution. Lump sum distributions were paid from plan assets totaling

$664 million

during fourth quarter 2018. In connection with this transaction, we have recorded a settlement charge of

$200 million

during fourth quarter 2018, accelerating the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss”, that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. The settlement triggered a plan remeasurement, however due to the short period between the settlement and our normal year-end remeasurement, the effects were insignificant to the net periodic benefit costs and therefore not recorded.

In January 2019, we transferred approximately

$1.5 billion

of U.S. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of a group annuity contract. We expect to record an additional settlement charge of approximately

$450 million

in connection with this transaction during first quarter 2019.

To maintain the U.S. qualified pension plan's current funded status in connection with these transactions, we contributed

$300 million

to the plan during third quarter


. Refer to

Note 21: Income Taxes

for details on the tax effects of this transaction.

FUNDED STATUS OF PLANS

The funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year. The following table demonstrates how our plans' funded status is reflected on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

Assets and liabilities on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

are different from the cumulative income or expense that we have recorded associated with the plans. The differences are actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and amortized into periodic benefit costs in future periods. Unamortized amounts are recorded in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss", which is a component of total equity on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

. The "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" section of

Note 16: Shareholder's Interest

details changes in these amounts by component.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Changes in Fair Value of Plan Assets

We estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based upon the information available during the year-end reporting process. In some cases, primarily with regard to private equity funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, plus cash flows and market events between the interim date and the end of the year. We update the year-end estimated fair value of pension plan assets during the first half of the next year to incorporate year-end net asset values received after we have filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K. During second quarter 2018, we recorded an increase in the beginning of year fair value of the pension assets of

$44 million

, or less than 1 percent.

During second quarter 2018, we also updated our mortality assumption and census data used to estimate our projected benefit obligation for our U.S. qualified pension plan. We recorded an adjustment to our projected benefit obligation, incorporating updated census data and applying new company-specific mortality data. As a result of these updates, the beginning of year pension projected benefit obligation decreased by

$155 million

, or approximately 2 percent. The net effect of these updates, including the update to the pension assets, was a

$199 million

improvement in funded status

See additional details about the changes in the fair value of plan assets in the "Pension Assets" section below.

Changes in Projected Benefit Obligations of Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

See additional details about the actuarial assumptions and changes in the projected benefit obligation in the "Actuarial Assumptions" section below.

PENSION ASSETS

Our Investment Policies and Strategies

Our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor. These funds include our:

•

U.S. Pension Trust — funds our U.S. qualified pension plans;

•

Canadian Pension Trust — funds our Canadian registered pension plans; and

•

Retirement Compensation Arrangements — fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.

U.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts

As of the end of 2018, we have begun to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that will more closely match the pension plan liability profile going forward. The former investment strategy included investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, derivative instruments and other investments. These asset classes are now generally in redemption and run-off mode however, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a significant portion of the plan assets for several years. We expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values. As these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our revised investment strategy.

The revised investment strategy targets an initial 60 percent allocation to growth assets and a 40 percent allocation to liability hedging assets. We expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plan improves. Growth assets include new investments in global equities, hedge funds, which are generally in redemption, and private equity assets, which are generally in run-off mode. Liability hedging assets include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities, treasury futures and interest rate swaps selected to align with the plan liabilities.

Cash and short-term investments

include highly liquid money market and government securities and are primarily held to fund benefit payments, capital calls, margin requirements or to meet regulatory requirements. Cash at December 31, 2018, includes amounts that will be invested in liability hedging assets such as fixed income investments.

Fixed income investments

include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. These bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure, and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities. The fixed income investments are invested largely in line with long corporate bond indices.

Hedge fund and related investments

are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. General members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund’s underlying investment decisions. Underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. These funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity, and redemption provisions.

Private equity and related investments

are investments in private equity, mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. Private equity funds generally participate in buyouts and venture capital of limited liability entities through unlisted equity and debt instruments. These funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. Mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.

Derivative instruments

are comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. Equity and fixed income index derivatives are used to achieve target equity and bond exposure or to reduce exposure to certain market risks. Foreign currency derivatives reduce exposure to certain currency risks. Total return swaps enable exposure to return characteristics of specific financial strategies with limited exchange of principal.

Assets within our qualified and registered pension plans in our U.S. and Canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:

Retirement Compensation Arrangements

Retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans. As required by Canadian tax rules, approximately

50 percent

of these assets are invested into a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency. This portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. The remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.

Managing Risk

Investments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit risks. The following provides an overview of these risks and describes governance processes and actions we take to mitigate these risks on our pension plan asset portfolios.

Market price risk

is the risk that market fluctuations will adversely affect the value of plan assets. The trusts mitigate market price risk by investing in a diversified portfolio. In addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments, and comprehensive investment and operational due diligence.

Liquidity risk

is the risk that the trust will not be able to settle liabilities such as payments to participants, counterparties, and service providers. Plan investments in limited liability pools with no active secondary market may be illiquid. Private equity funds are subject to distribution and funding schedules set by fund managers and market activity. Hedge funds may also be subject to restrictions that delay redemptions. To mitigate liquidity risk, private equity portfolios have been diversified across different vintage years and strategies, and hedge fund portfolios have been

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



diversified across investment fund managers, strategies and liquidity provisions. In addition, the investment committee regularly reviews cash flows of the pension trusts and sets appropriate guidelines to address liquidity needs. With the change in investment strategy and a larger percentage of the plan assets invested in more liquid instruments such as publicly traded fixed income investments, liquidity risk is greatly reduced.

Currency risk

arises from holding plan assets denominated in a currency other than the currency in which its liabilities are settled. Currency risk is generally managed through notional contracts designed to hedge net exposure to non-functional currencies. With the change in investment strategy, currency risk will be mitigated going forward by investing more of the Canadian plan assets in Canadian dollar investments.

Interest rate risk

exists on both the asset and liability side, and is the risk that a change in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of interest rate securities or liabilities, thereby affecting the overall funded status. With the change in investment strategy to more closely match the plan liabilities, interest rate risk will be greatly reduced.

Credit risk

is the risk that counterparties’ failure to discharge their obligations could affect cash flows. The trusts have exposure through investments in fixed income securities. This risk is mitigated by investing in a diversified portfolio. The trusts also have exposure through settlement receivables from derivative contracts. Only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk for these types of investments, and no principal is at risk. We decrease credit risk exposure by only dealing with highly-rated financial counterparties; as of year-end, our counterparties each had a credit rating of at least A from S&P.

We further manage this risk through diversification of counterparties, predefined settlement and margining provisions and documented agreements.

We are also exposed to credit risk indirectly through counterparty relationships initiated by underlying managers of investments in limited liability pools. This risk is mitigated through initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring processes.

Valuation of Our Plan Assets

Pension assets are stated at fair value as of the reporting date. Fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We do not consider forced or distressed sale scenarios. Instead, we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.

We value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. The fair value hierarchy is:

•

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.

•

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

•

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

Investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

Cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market.

Fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.

Hedge funds, private equities, and related fund units are valued based on the net asset values of the funds. These values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. When net asset values as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported net asset values for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.

Derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative’s counterparty. Some of these contracts are not publicly traded.

The net pension plan assets, when categorized in accordance with this fair value hierarchy, are as follows. Investments valued using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient are presented to reconcile with total plan assets.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased risk. Approximately

$330 million

, or

6.7 percent

, of our pension plan assets were classified as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2018.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the pension plan assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) is presented below:

The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. We evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.

We estimate the expected long-term return on assets for our qualified, registered and nonregistered pension plans.

Qualified and Registered Pension Plans

We assumed a long-term rate of return on plan assets of

8.0 percent

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

As of the end of 2018, we have begun implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that will more closely match the plan’s liability profile moving forward, resulting in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. With this change, we have determined that we will reduce our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to

7.0 percent

for the year ended December 31, 2019

.

Determining our expected return requires a high degree of judgment. We consider actual pension fund performance over multiple years, and current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets. Historical fund returns are used as a base, and we place added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.

Nonregistered Plans

Canadian tax rules require that 50 percent of the assets for nonregistered plans go to a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account. As a result, the return we earn investing the other 50 percent is spread over 100 percent of the assets. Our expected long-term annual rate of return on the portion we are allowed to manage is

7.0 percent

. This assumption is based on historical experience and

future return expectations. The expected overall annual return on assets that fund our nonregistered plans is 3.5 percent.

Health Care Costs

Rising costs of health care affect the costs of our other postretirement plans. We use assumptions about health care cost trend rates to estimate the cost of benefits we provide. Our trend rate assumptions are based on historical market experience, current environment and future expectations. In


, the assumed weighted health care cost trend rate was:

•

8.4 percent

for U.S. Pre-Medicare

•

4.5 percent

for U.S. Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)

•

5.1 percent

for Canada

This table shows the assumptions we use in estimating the annual cost increase for health care benefits we provide.

Assumptions We Use in Estimating Health Care Benefit Cost Trends

The assumed health care cost trend rate can influence projected postretirement benefit plan payments. The following table demonstrates the effect a one percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have with all other assumptions remaining constant.

Expected Pension Plan and Benefit Funding

Established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. We fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due. We voluntarily contributed

$300 million

to our U.S. qualified pension plans during 2018, although there was no minimum required contribution for the year

.

During

$22 million

for our Canadian registered plans, we made contributions and benefit payments of

$2 million

for our Canadian nonregistered pension plans and made benefit payments of

$19 million

•

be required to contribute or make benefit payments for our Canadian nonregistered plans of

$3 million

; and

•

make benefit payments of approximately

Estimated Projected Benefit Payments for the Next 10 Years

UNION-ADMINISTERED MULTIEMPLOYER BENEFIT PLANS

We contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. These plans cover a small number of our employees and on an annual basis our contributions are immaterial.

These plans have different risks than single-employer plans. Our contributions may be used to fund benefits for employees of other participating employers. If we choose to stop participating, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan

.

If another participating employer stops contributing to the plan, we may become responsible for remaining plan unfunded obligations.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

We sponsor various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. Our contributions to these plans were:

•

$22 million

NOTE 14:

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE OF DEBT

The estimated fair values and carrying values of our long-term debt and line of credit consisted of the following:

To estimate the fair value of long-term debt, we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt.

We believe that our variable rate long-term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences.

The inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.

FAIR VALUE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables, and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

This note provides details about our:

•

legal proceedings,

•

environmental matters and

•

commitments and other contingencies.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our

Consolidated Balance Sheet,

Consolidated Statement of Operations

, or

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

.

See

Note 21: Income Taxes

for a discussion of a tax proceeding involving Plum Creek's 2008 U.S. federal income tax return.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Site Remediation

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) – commonly known as Superfund – and similar state laws, we:

•

are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and

•

have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.

We have received notification from the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the Kalamazoo River Superfund site in southwest Michigan. Our involvement in the remediation site is based on our former ownership of the Plainwell, Michigan mill located within the remediation site. Several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under CERCLA.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



We cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the EPA on April 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the Otsego Township Dam Area. During third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.

In 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia-Pacific LLC in an action seeking contribution under CERCLA for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for 5 percent of approximately $50 million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. The remaining 95 percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants.

The opinion and order, which is currently on appeal before the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site. In connection with the opinion and order, we updated our best estimate of the liability associated with the site and recorded a pretax charge of $28 million in first quarter 2018 within "Other operating costs (income), net" on the

Consolidated Statement of Operations

.

Our Established Reserves.

We have established reserves for estimated remediation costs on the active Superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party. These reserves are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other liabilities" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

Changes in the Reserve for Environmental Remediation

We change our accrual to reflect:

•

new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,

•

updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and

•

costs incurred to remediate sites.

Estimates.

We believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to

$126 million

.

This estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. The estimate:

•

is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and

•

uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

In estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:

•

assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,

•

took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and

•

considered each party

’

s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.

We have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in Canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. Some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. We have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. In situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. These obligations are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other liabilities" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

Reconciliation of Our Common Share Activity

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

In November 2015, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to

$2.5 billion

of outstanding shares subsequent to the closing of our merger with Plum Creek (the 2016 Repurchase Program). Transaction fees incurred for repurchases are not counted as use of funds authorized for repurchases under the 2016 Share Repurchase Authorization. During 2016, we repurchased

68 million

shares of common stock for

$2 billion

under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 2017. As of

December 31, 2017

, we had remaining authorization of

$500 million

for future stock repurchases.

During 2018, we repurchased

11 million

shares of common stock for

$366 million

(including transaction fees), under the 2016 Repurchase Program. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had remaining authorization of

$135 million

for future stock repurchases.

On February 7, 2019, our board of directors terminated the 2016 Repurchase Program and approved a new share repurchase program (the 2019 Repurchase Program) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $500 million of outstanding shares.

All common stock purchases under the 2016 Repurchase Programs were made in open-market transactions.

We record share repurchases upon trade date as opposed to the settlement date when cash is disbursed. We record a liability to account for repurchases that have not been cash settled. There were

no

unsettled repurchases as of

OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

Our long-term incentive plans provide for share-based awards that include:

•

restricted stock,

•

restricted stock units (RSUs),

•

performance shares,

•

performance share units (PSUs),

•

stock options and

•

stock appreciation rights (SARs).

We may issue future grants of up to

21 million

shares under the 2013 Plan. We also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants.

For restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, PSUs or other equity grants:

•

An individual participant may receive a grant of up to

1 million

shares annually.

•

No participant may be granted awards that exceed

$10 million

earned in a 12-month period.

For stock options and SARs:

•

An individual participant may receive a grant of up to

2 million

shares in any one calendar year.

•

The exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.

We have not granted any additional SARs since 2016. Additionally, the remaining liability related to SARs is immaterial at December 31, 2018.

The Compensation Committee of our board of directors annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.

For stock-settled awards, we:

•

issue new stock into the marketplace and

•

generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.

Our common shares would increase by approximately

30 million

shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. These include:

•

all options, RSUs and PSUs outstanding at

December 31, 2018

, under the 2013 Plan and 2004 Plan; and

•

all remaining options, RSUs and PSUs that could be granted under the 2013 Plan.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RESULTING FROM OUR MERGER WITH PLUM CREEK

Replacement awards were granted as a result of the merger with Plum Creek. Eligible outstanding Plum Creek stock options, RSUs and deferred stock unit awards were converted into equivalent equity awards with respect to Weyerhaeuser Common Shares, after giving effect to the appropriate adjustments to reflect the consummation of the merger.

In total, we issued replacement awards consisting of

1,953 thousand

stock options and

1,248 thousand

RSUs. The replacement stock option awards were fully vested and had a total value of

$5 million

, which was included in the equity consideration issued with the merger. Qualifying terminations during 2016 resulted in accelerated vesting of

705 thousand

of the replacement RSUs and recognition of

$15 million

of expense. The accelerated expense is included in the merger-related integration costs as described in

Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

.

We also assumed

289,910

value management awards (VMAs) through the merger with Plum Creek. Qualifying terminations during 2016 resulted in

$6 million

of expense recognized for VMAs. This accelerated expense is included in merger-related integration costs as described in

Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS

When accounting for share-based awards we:

•

use a fair-value-based measurement for share-based awards and

•

recognize the cost of share-based awards in our consolidated financial statements.

We recognize the cost of share-based awards in our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

over the required service period — generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is vested. Special situations include:

•

Awards that vest upon retirement — the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.

•

Awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business — the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.

In these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.

TAX BENEFITS OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS

Our total income tax benefit from share-based awards — as recognized in our

Consolidated Statement of Operations

— for the last three years was:

•

$5 million

in


,

•

$6 million

in


and

•

$12 million

in


.

The 2016 amount above contains a

$2 million

income tax benefit from share-based awards to employees that were part of the Cellulose Fibers divestitures which is included in our results of discontinued operations.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

Tax benefits from share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense and realized when:

•

restricted shares and RSUs vest,

•

performance shares and PSUs vest,

•

stock options are exercised and

•

SARs are exercised.

TYPES OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Our share-based compensation is in the form of:

•

restricted stock units,

•

performance share units,

•

stock options and

•

stock appreciation rights.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Through the 2013 Plan, we award RSUs — grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.

The Details

Our RSUs granted in


,


and


generally:

•

vest ratably over

four

years;

•

immediately vest in the event of death while employed or disability;

•

continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one year anniversary of the grant;

•

continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement has not been met; and

•

will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.

Our Accounting

The fair value of our RSUs is the market price of our stock on the grant-date of the awards.

We generally record share-based compensation expense for RSUs over the four-year vesting period. Generally, for RSUs that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

Activity

The following table shows our RSU activity for


.

The weighted average grant-date fair value for RSUs was:

•

$34.19

in


,

•

$32.83

in


and

•

$30.25

in


.

The total grant-date fair value of RSUs vested was:

•

$16 million

in


,

•

$18 million

in


and

•

$36 million

in


.

Nonvested RSUs accrue dividends that are paid out when RSUs vest. Any RSUs forfeited will not receive dividends.

As RSUs vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. As a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS

Through the 2013 Plan, we award PSUs — grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.

The Details

The final number of shares awarded will range from 0 percent to 150 percent of each grant’s target, depending upon actual company performance.

For shares granted in 2018 and 2017, the ultimate number of PSUs earned is based on two measures:

•

our relative total shareholder return (TSR) ranking measured against the S&P 500 over a three-year period and

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



•

our relative TSR ranking measured against an industry peer group of companies over a three-year period.

For shares granted in 2016, the ultimate number of PSUs earned is based on three measures:

•

our relative total shareholder return (TSR) ranking measured against the S&P 500 over a three-year period,

•

our relative TSR ranking measured against an industry peer group of companies over a three-year period and

•

achievement of Plum Creek merger cost synergy targets.

The vesting provisions for PSUs granted in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows:

•

vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date as long as the individual remains employed by the company;

•

fully vest in the event the participant dies or becomes disabled while employed;

•

continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one year anniversary of the grant;

•

continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement criteria has not been met and the employee has met the second anniversary of the grant date; and

•

will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.

Our Accounting

Since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model estimates the TSR ranking of the company over the performance period. Compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the vesting period on an accelerated basis. Generally, compensation expense would be reversed if the performance condition is not met unless the requisite service period has been achieved.

Weighted Average Assumptions Used in Estimating the Value of Performance Share Units

Activity

The following table shows our PSU activity for


.

The total grant-date fair value of PSUs vested was:

•

$4 million

in


,

•

$4 million

in


and

•

$8 million

in


.

As PSUs vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover participant taxes. As a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.

STOCK OPTIONS

Stock options entitle award recipients to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price. During


and 2017, we did not grant any stock option awards. When granted in prior years, however, we granted stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the date of the grant.

The Details

Our stock options generally:

•

vest over

four

years of continuous service,

•

must be exercised within 10 years of the grant-date and

•

use a Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of every stock option award on its grant-date.

UNRECOGNIZED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of

December 31, 2018

, our unrecognized share-based compensation cost for all types of share-based awards included

$33 million

related to non-vested equity-classified share-based compensation arrangements — expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately

1.1 years

.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION STOCK EQUIVALENT UNITS

Certain employees and our board of directors may defer compensation into stock-equivalent units.

The Details

The 2013 Plan works differently for employees and directors.

Eligible employees:

•

may choose to defer all or part of their bonus into stock-equivalent units;

•

may choose to defer part of their salary, except for executive officers; and

•

receive a 15 percent premium if the deferral is for at least five years.

Our directors:

•

receive a portion of their annual retainer fee in the form of RSUs, which vest over one year and may be deferred into stock-equivalent units;

•

may choose to defer some or all of the remainder of their annual retainer fee into stock-equivalent units; and

•

do not receive a premium for their deferrals.

Employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director.

Our Accounting

We settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash for our employees. Our directors receive shares of common stock as payment for stock-equivalent units. In addition, we credit all stock-equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents. The number of common shares to be issued in the future to directors is

639 thousand

.

Stock-equivalent units are:

•

liability-classified awards and

•

re-measured to fair value at every reporting date.

The fair value of a stock-equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.

Activity

The number of stock-equivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts were:

•

788 thousand

as of

December 31, 2018

CHARGES FOR INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING, CLOSURES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

Items Included in Our Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments

INTEGRATION, RESTRUCTURING AND CLOSURES

During 2017, we incurred and accrued for termination benefits (primarily severance) and non-recurring professional services costs directly attributable to our merger with Plum Creek.

During 2016, we incurred and accrued for termination benefits (primarily severance), accelerated share-based payment costs, and accelerated pension benefits based upon actual and expected qualifying terminations of certain employees as a result of restructuring decisions made subsequent to the merger. We also incurred non-recurring professional services costs for investment banking, legal and consulting, and certain other fees directly attributable to our merger with Plum Creek.

Other restructuring and closure costs include lease termination charges, dismantling and demolition of plant and equipment, gain or loss on disposition of assets, environmental cleanup costs and incremental costs to wind down operating facilities.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

The Impairment of Long-Lived Assets section of

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

provides details about how we account for these impairments. Additional information can also be found in our

Critical Accounting Policies

.

Long-Lived Assets

Our long-lived asset impairments were primarily related to the following:

•


— In second quarter 2017, we recognized an impairment charge to the timberlands and manufacturing assets of our Uruguayan operations. On June 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an agreement to sell all of the Company's equity in the Uruguayan operations to a consortium led by BTG Pactual's Timberland Investment Group (TIG). As a result of this agreement, the related assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at June 30, 2017. This designation required us to record the related assets at fair value, less an amount of estimated selling costs, and thus recognize a

$147 million

noncash pretax impairment charge. This amount was recorded in the Timberlands segment. The fair value of the related assets was primarily based on the agreed upon cash purchase price of

$403 million

. On September 1, 2017, we announced the completion of the sale. Refer to

Note 4: Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

for further details on the Uruguayan operations sale.

Additionally, in September 2017, we recognized an impairment charge of

$6 million

related to a nonstrategic asset in our Wood Products segment. The fair value of the asset was determined using the value indicated in a purchase and sale agreement.

•


— We recognized a

$15 million

impairment charge in Real Estate & ENR which represents the fair value less direct selling costs of certain development projects that we planned to sell that had a book value greater than fair value. The fair values of the projects were determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on broker opinion of value reports.

NOTE 19:

CHARGES (RECOVERIES) FOR PRODUCT REMEDIATION, NET

In July 2017, we announced the implementation of a solution to address concerns regarding our TJI® Joists coated with our former Flak Jacket® Protection product. This issue was isolated to Flak Jacket product manufactured after December 1, 2016, and did not affect any of our other products.

We recorded insurance recoveries of

$25 million

and product remediation charges of

$25 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

. During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we recorded

$290 million

to accrue for expected costs associated with the remediation. The charges recorded were attributable to our Wood Products segment and were recorded in "Charges (recoveries) for product remediation, net" on the

Consolidated Statement of Operations

Income taxes related to discontinued operations are discussed in

Note 4: Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

.

The Income Taxes section of

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

provides details about how we account for our income taxes.

Tax Legislation

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), was enacted. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from

35 percent

to

21 percent

. As a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a tax expense of

$74 million

during 2017, which reduced our net deferred tax asset. We were not required to pay a repatriation tax due to the fact that we had no foreign undistributed earnings at December 31, 2017.

The most significant effects of the Tax Act provisions for 2018 include a reduction to our overall estimated annual effective tax rate primarily due to the reduced corporate tax rate, and new limitations on certain business deductions.

During first quarter 2018, we adopted ASU 2018-02 which allowed for the reclassification of certain income tax effects related to the Tax Act between "Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “Retained earnings”. Refer to

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

for further details on this ASU and the related effect on our financial statements.

Pension Contribution Tax Adjustment

At the end of 2017, we revalued our deferred tax assets (including pension) to the 2018 federal tax rate of

21 percent

, as a result of the Tax Act, as discussed above. During third quarter 2018, we announced actions intended to reduce the liabilities of our U.S. qualified pension plan while maintaining the plan’s current funded status and made a decision to contribute

$300 million

to our U.S. qualified pension plan (refer to

Note 10: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

). We were able to deduct this contribution on our 2017 U.S. federal tax return at the 2017 federal tax rate of

35 percent

. This resulted in an incremental

$41 million

tax benefit for the portion attributable to our TRSs during third quarter 2018.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future tax effect created by differences between the timing of when income or deductions are recognized for pretax financial book reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets represent a future tax benefit (or reduction to income taxes in a future period), while deferred tax liabilities represent a future tax obligation (or increase to income taxes in a future period). Our deferred tax assets and liabilities have been revalued for the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate.

Other Information About Our Deferred Income Tax Assets (Liabilities)

Other information about our deferred income tax assets (liabilities) include:

•

net operating loss and credit carryforwards,

•

valuation allowances and

•

reinvestment of undistributed earnings.

Net Operating Loss and Credit Carryforwards

Our gross federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of


totaled

$584 million

as follows:

•

U.S. REIT -

$223 million

, which expire from


through


;

•

State -

$361 million

, which expire from


through


; and

•

Foreign - none currently recorded.

Our gross state credit carryforwards at the end of

$65 million

, which includes

$14 million

that expire from


through


and

$51 million

that do not expire. Our U.S. TRS has

$6 million

in foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in


.

Valuation Allowances

With the exception of the valuation allowance discussed below, we believe it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.

Our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was

$61 million

at the end of


, related to state credits, state net operating losses and passive foreign tax credits.

Reinvestment of Undistributed Earnings

We have historically asserted it is our intent to reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. In fourth quarter


, we changed our position regarding the earnings of our Canadian subsidiary. Our change in assertion was based on the company’s review of global cash management and planned capital deployment, taking into consideration the effects of the Tax Act. As of


, our assertion is to permanently reinvest approximately 10 percent of our Canadian earnings. We have no other foreign subsidiaries with undistributed earnings. Accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided primarily related to Canadian withholding taxes associated with Canadian earnings no longer considered permanently reinvested.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. The total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2018

, and


, is

$3 million

and

$4 million

, of which a net amount of

$1 million

and

$2 million

, respectively, would affect our tax rate if recognized.

The net liability recorded in our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

related to unrecognized tax benefits is

$1 million

as of

December 31, 2018

, comprised of the

$3 million

gross unrecognized tax benefit amount net of

$2 million

in loss carryforwards available to offset the liability. The net liability as of

December 31, 2017

, was

$2 million

, comprised of

$4 million

gross unrecognized tax benefit amount net of

$2 million

loss carryforwards available to offset the liability.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



In accordance with our accounting policy, we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. See

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Reconciliation of the Beginning and Ending Amount of Unrecognized Tax Benefits

As of

December 31, 2018

, none of our U.S. federal income tax returns or foreign jurisdiction income tax returns are under examination. Our U.S. federal income tax returns are open to examination for years 2015 forward and foreign jurisdictions income tax returns are open to examination for years 2010 forward. We are undergoing examinations in state jurisdictions for tax years 2009 through 2017, with tax years 2009 forward open to examination. We do not expect that the outcome of any examination will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.

In the next 12 months, we estimate a decrease of

$1 million

in unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation.

RESOLUTION OF IRS MATTER

In connection with the merger with Plum Creek, we acquired equity interests in Southern Diversified Timber, LLC, a timberland joint venture (Timberland Venture) with an affiliate of Campbell Global LLC (TCG Member). On August 31, 2016, the Timberland Venture redeemed TCG Member's interest and became a fully consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser.

We received a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (FPAA), dated July 20, 2016, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in regard to Plum Creek's 2008 U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction forming the Timberland Venture. The IRS asserted that the transfer of the timberlands to the Timberland Venture was a taxable transaction to Plum Creek at the time of the transfer rather than a nontaxable capital contribution. We subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest this adjustment.

On February 8, 2019, we entered into a closing agreement with the IRS to settle this dispute. Under the terms of the agreement, the company paid approximately

$21 million

of corporate tax. This amount was recorded as tax expense in fourth quarter 2018. No interest or penalties will be assessed. The parties have filed a stipulated decision with the U.S. Tax Court, pursuant to which the Court will officially close the matter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Weyerhaeuser Company:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 15, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
