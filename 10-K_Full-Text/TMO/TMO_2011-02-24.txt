Raw Materials

Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business. Raw-material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

Patents are important in both segments of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.

Seasonal Influences

Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season.

Working Capital Requirements

There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.

Competition

The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. In general, competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors:

·

technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios;

·

product differentiation, availability and reliability;

·

the depth of our capabilities;

·

our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services;

·

customer service and support;

·

active research and application-development programs; and

·

relative prices of our products and services.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984. Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.

We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $22 million at December 31, 2010. The liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present 
value.

These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results 
of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory Affairs

Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department 
of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Number of Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 37,200 employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.

We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, 
in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:

•

strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;

•

allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

•

developing new applications for our technologies;

•

expanding our service offerings;

•

continuing key customer initiatives;

•

combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;

•

finding new markets for our products; and

•

continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors (continued)

Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. The current economic conditions including the lingering effects of the global recession could adversely impact our business in 2011 and beyond, resulting in:

•

reduced demand for some of our products;

•

increased rate of order cancellations or delays;

•

increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

•

increased pressure on the prices for our products and services; and

•

greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.

Demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.

As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational corporation, our businesses o
ccasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2010, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $20 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.

Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.

The recently enacted Federal legislation on healthcare reform could have an adverse impact on us. Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services. The new legislation also includes an excise tax, beginning in 2013, on revenue from the sale by manufacturers of certain medical devices, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors (continued)

Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S.
 and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results o
f operations.

We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.

Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or te
chnology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could
 have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.

If any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.

The products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to p
roduct liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors (continued)

Our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we
 may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.

Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in 
turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.

We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governin
g government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.

Our largest customer in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products fr
om multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.

Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability

. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as UPS and Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If UPS or another third-party package-delivery provider experiences a major work stoppage, prevent
ing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if UPS or our other third-party package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors (continued)

We are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of products, the shipping of our products and environmental matters.

Some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which w
ould increase our costs and reduce our revenues.

We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling, transportation, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances. Some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, sell or distribute. This requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs, and manage environmental risks.

We rely heavily on our manufacturing operations to produce products we sell, and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations.

We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain th
e materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Fluctuations in our

effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we opera
te. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins, steel and serum. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.

Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems or system failures at certain of our sites could interfere with our operations.

As a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to 
improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors (continued)

We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precaut
ions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.

Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.14 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional $952 million under our revolving credit facility. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations. If we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedne
ss to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.

Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

Properties

The location and general character of our principal properties by segment as of December 31, 2010, are as follows:

Analytical Technologies

We own approximately 4.0 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Virginia, Utah and California within the U.S., and in Germany, England and Switzerland. We lease approximately 3.4 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Massachusetts, California, Texas, Kansas and Michigan within the U.S., and in China, England, Finland, Germany and Australia, under various leases that expire between 2011 and 2029.

Laboratory Products and Services

We own approximately 7.1 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and North Carolina within the U.S., and in England Germany, Canada, Denmark and France. We lease approximately 4.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Tennessee and New Jersey within the U.S. and in Australia, Mexico, Germany and England, under various leases that expire between 2011 and 2021.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business. We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured. These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions. We believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers. Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respe
ct to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable. See “Item 1 – Business – Environmental Matters,” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.

We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agency for International Development. Various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations. Some operations involve and have involved the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material
 in the future.

Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of customers.

Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased from 2009 revenues by $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus-funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. The increase in revenues was offset by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season than in 2009, as discussed below. These factors decreased sales by approximately 2 percentage points. The company estimates that stimulus-funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percent
age point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter.

The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2010 and 2009. The company’s principal acquisitions are described below.

·

Fermentas, a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, was acquired in July 2010 to expand the company’s ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research.

·

Finnzymes, a provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, was acquired in March 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets.

·

Ahura Scientific, a provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, was acquired in February 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of portable analytical devices.

·

B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening, was acquired in October 2009 to increase the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provide a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe.

·

Biolab, an Australia-based provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory equipment, was acquired in April 2009 to broaden the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels.

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)

On December 13, 2010, the company and Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a transaction under which Thermo Fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex for $118.50 per share in cash, or a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentatio
n helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products. The transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals.

In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition.

The company’s effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba
lances of changes in tax rates.

Income from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010, from $851 million in 2009, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income, offset in part by a higher tax rate.

During 2010, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.50 billion, compared with $1.66 billion for 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items, particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales.

As of December 31, 2010, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r
evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010.

In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 – 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short-term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)

The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Manage
ment believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts Receivable

The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2010. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.

(b)

Inventories

The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.

(c)

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets 
totaled $4.71 billion at December 31, 2010. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affec
t projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.

The company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating
 performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.

(d)

Other Long-lived Assets

The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.

(e)

Revenues

In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.

The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per
formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.

(f)

Warranty Obligations

At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.

(g)

Income Taxes

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s
 reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized.

The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala
nces and hence the company’s net income.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.

The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result.

(h)

Contingencies and Litigation

The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

(i)

Pension and Other Retiree Benefits

Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled
 $14 million in 2010. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year-end 2010 compared with $225 million at year-end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million.

The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011.

(j)

Stock-based Compensation

The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-
based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.

Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus-funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t
ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus-funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter.

In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Results of Operations (continued)

In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 
2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit’s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write-downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio
lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006.

As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Segment Results

The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus-funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables.

Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re
venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010.

In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company’s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by
 approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011.

Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition.

Provision for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba
lances of changes in tax rates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Results of Operations (continued)

In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the company’s tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits.

Contingent Liabilities

At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10 could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.

Discontinued Operations

During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software-enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the
 software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the company’s results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co
mpany’s results of operations or financial position.

Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s
evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia.

In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.

In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn.

In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre-merger Fisher product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses
 at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio
n-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te
sts.

Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the company’s research mar
ket and healthcare market channels.

In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company’s revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million.

Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9).

Provision for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.

Discontinued Operations

During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below.


Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010.

During 2010, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

The company’s financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company’s common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The company’s financing activities also included $77 million of proc
eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the company’s common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company’s common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company's common stock through February 22, 2012.

The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million.

As of December 31, 2010, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r
evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 – 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short-term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2009, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.

The company’s financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T
he company’s financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises.


Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million.

In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa
ny’s cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.

Interest Rates

The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to 
maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million.

In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $12 million.

Currency Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in 
a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $441 million.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)

The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the company’s net income.

Equity Prices

The company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $45 million.

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2010. Based on this evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, reported and accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its chief e
xecutive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Item 9A.         Controls and Procedures (continued)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated F
ramework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To

the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, eff
ective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accountin
g Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We belie
ve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authoriz
ations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. The company offers customers a complete range of high-end analytical instruments, software, services, consumables and reagents to enable integrated laboratory workflow solutions and a complete portfolio of laboratory equipment, chemicals, supplies and services used in healthcare, scientific research, safety and education. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well as environmental and industrial process control settings.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% using the equity method.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all significant obligations have been met, collectability is probable and title has passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until installation or other deliverable occurs, the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation or transfer of the deliverable. Provisions for discounts, warranties, r
ebates to customers, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often include multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support. The company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software main
tenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

Service revenues represent the company’s service offerings including biopharma outsourcing, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field service including related time and materials. Service revenues are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues for service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period.

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience. Past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The company records shipping and handling charges billed to customers in net sales and records shipping and handling costs in cost of product revenues for all periods presented.

Deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue on service contracts, which is recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. Substantially all of the deferred revenue in the accompanying 2010 balance sheet will be recognized within one year.

Warranty Obligations

The company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability woul
d be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of warranty obligations are as follows:

Income Taxes

The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 7).

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for the convertible obligations and the exercise of stock options, as well as their related income tax effects (Note 8).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. Such securities principally represent available-for-sale investments. In addition, the company owns marketable equity securities that represent less than 20% ownership and for which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such investments are also considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value, with the difference between cost and fair market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 11 and 12). Decreases in fair market values
 of individual securities below cost for a duration of six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary impairment, and the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount of the investments to fair market value through other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income (Note 4). Should a decrease in the fair market value of debt securities be deemed attributable to non-credit loss conditions, however, no impairment is recorded in the statement of income if the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity.

Other investments for which there are not readily determinable market values are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provides that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company had cost method investments with carrying amounts of $10.6 million and $10.4 million, respectively, which are included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purch
asing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows:

The company recorded a reduction in cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories of $0.9 million, $1.4 million and $0.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired product technology, patents, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired.

Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Other Assets

Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include deferred tax assets, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, notes receivable, fair value adjustments related to interest rate swap agreements, cash surrender value of life insurance, deferred debt expense, capitalized catalog costs, cost-method investments, investments in joint ventures and other assets.

The company owns 49% - 50% interests in two joint ventures and records its pro rata share of the joint ventures’ results in other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income, using the equity method of accounting. The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and disposable laboratory glass products. The results of the joint ventures were not material for any period presented. The company made purchases of products for resale from the glass products joint venture totaling $44.0 million, $45.1 million and $47.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. When an impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill is recorded as an operating loss. The company completed annual tests for impairment at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Asset Retirement Obligations

The company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lea
se as interest expense. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations of $22.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively.

Loss Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at their fair value and, as such, were discounted to their present value at the dates of acquisition.

Advertising

The company records advertising costs as expenses as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of future benefit, generally one to three years. The company has capitalized advertising costs of $3.7 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed. Advertising expense, which includes amortization of capitalized direct-response advertising, as described above, was $27.3 million, $31.2 million and $35.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in a
dvertising expense was catalog amortization of $6.8 million, $11.1 million and $13.1 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “Accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the accompanying statement of income and are not material for the three years presented.

Derivative Contracts

The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes all derivatives, including forward currency-exchange contracts, in the balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.

Financial Statement Index

F-16


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The company uses short-term forward and option currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. These contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. The company enters into these currency-exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases and sales as well as assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business, principally accounts receivable and intercompany loans. Acco
rdingly, the hedges are not speculative in nature. As part of the company’s overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of currency-exchange fluctuations, some business units hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing 12-month period, using exchange contracts that have maturities of 12 months or less. The company has elected not to account for its forward-currency exchange contracts entered into for purposes other than anticipated purchases or sales as hedges. These derivatives are recorded at fair value in its balance sheet in other current assets or other accrued expenses with the changes in fair value reflected immediately in earnings (Note 12). As of December 31, 2010, the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that were hedging anticipated purchases or sales. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.

Cash flow hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the company had no outstanding derivative contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. During 2009 and 2010, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements (Notes 9 and 12). The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software-enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the
 software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the company’s results of operations or financial position.

Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co
mpany’s results of operations or financial position.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets, and in determining the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14). Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note 2.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

On December 13, 2010, the company and Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a transaction under which Thermo Fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex for $118.50 per share in cash, or a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentatio
n helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products.

The transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals.

Under the terms of the agreement, the company has commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex common stock for $118.50 per share in cash.

2010 Acquisitions

In February 2010, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired Ahura Scientific, Inc., a U.S.-based provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, for $147 million, net of cash acquired, plus up to $25 million of additional contingent consideration based upon the achievement of specified operating results in 2010, of which the company recorded $20 million as the fair value at the acquisition date and an additional $5 million as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in December 2010. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio of portable analytical devices. Revenues of Ahura Scientific totaled $45 million in 2009. The purchase price e
xceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $110 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In March 2010, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired Finnzymes, a Finland-based provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, for $58 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expands the company’s portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets. Finnzymes reported revenues of $20 million in 2009. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $25 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In July 2010, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired Fermentas International Inc., a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, with principal operations in Lithuania, for $260 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expands the company’s ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research. Fermentas reported revenues of approximately $55 million in 2009. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $120 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

2009 Acquisitions

In April 2009, the company’s Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Biolab, an Australia-based provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory equipment, for AUD 180 million (USD $132 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition broadened the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels. Revenue of Biolab totaled AUD 178 million in its fiscal year ended May 2009. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $62 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In October 2009, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening, for 331 million Euros (approximately $482 million including the assumption of $32 million of debt). The acquisition of B.R.A.H.M.S. increased the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provided a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe. B.R.A.H.M.S. reported revenues in 2008 of 75 million Euros. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $183 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2009 the Analytical Technologies segment acquired a culture media manufacturer and distributor in Malaysia and Singapore; the remaining interest in a Mexico-based manufacturer and distributor of bulk weighing products; and a developer of advanced, miniaturized gas chromatography instruments. The Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired a Spain-based distributor of laboratory instrumentation and equipment and a Sweden-based distributor of clinical chemistry analysis instruments.

Acquisitions and Dispositions (continued)

The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of synergies of combining the businesses. These synergies include elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses beginning in 2009. Allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and, for acquisitions completed within the past year, is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The company is not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocations will differ materially from the preliminary estimates.

Business Segment and Geographical Information

The company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments. The company’s segments are as follows:

Analytical Technologies: serves research scientists, as well as customers in healthcare and clinical laboratories, in manufacturing and in the field, with a suite of advanced analytical technologies, including scientific instruments, robotics and software for creating advanced integrated workflows. The segment also includes a range of diagnostic reagents and instruments used by hospitals and reference laboratories.

Laboratory Products and Services: serves life science, healthcare and safety markets with a broad portfolio of products and consumables used for routine laboratory processes, as well as a range of biopharma outsourcing services such as clinical packaging and biological sample management. The segment also includes the company’s extensive customer channels network consisting of catalog, e-commerce and other sales avenues.

The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. Options granted under these plans generally vest over

3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. The company practice is to grant options at fair market value. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises. G
rants of stock options and restricted stock on or after November 9, 2006, provide that in the event of both a future change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted stock awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).

Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier.

The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $10.9 million and $25.1 million, respectively, in 2010 and 2008. A tax charge of $1.6 million was recorded in capital in excess of par value in 2009 for th
e excess of deferred tax asset over actual tax benefits realized at option exercise.

Stock Options

The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximate
s the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $14.12, $10.41 and $12.70, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $48.1 million, $20.7 million and $95.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

Restricted Share/Unit Awards

The company awards to a number of key employees restricted company common stock or restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest in annual installments over three years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and p
erformance-based restricted share/unit awards is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

A summary of the status of the company’s restricted shares/units as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the three years then ended are presented below:

As of December 31, 2010, there was $45 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted share/unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2015 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years. At December 31, 2010, the vesting of 515,000 unvested restricted units is contingent upon the company’s future stock price performance exceeding that of a specified index.. The total fair value of shares vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $21.0 million, $20.2 million and $16.7 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company.

Shares may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. The company issued 127,000, 139,000 and 124,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2010, 2009 and 2008 plan years, which ended on December 31.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company charged to expense $62.6 million, $63.7 million and $55.5 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also has postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses, in which certain employees at those businesses are eligible to participate. The costs of the healthcare program are funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.

The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

When an employer is acquired as part of a merger, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost.

The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company made contributions of approximately $24.4 million, $41.1 million and $20.7 million, respectively. Contributions are estimated at between $20 and $30 million for 2011.

The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2017 and 2026.

The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases.

Domestic Pension Plan Assets

The company’s overall objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 4% of invested assets) of private equity investments. The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately

34% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 5% to real estate-related equities, approximately

29% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 37% to funds
 investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The tables above present the fair value of the company’s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12). Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company’s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions. The fair value of the company’s private equity and alternative investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.

The following table represents a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs.

The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately

50% - 60% for equities and

40% - 50% for fixed income. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. At December 31, 2010, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.

Income Taxes (continued)

At December 31, 2010, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $165.3 million, $609.9 million and $715.9 million, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.

The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2011 through 2030.

Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $242.6 million expire in the years 2011 through 2029, and the remainder do not expire. The company also had $180.6 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010, which expire in the years 2011 through 2020.

A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $3.7 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. During 2009, the company changed its position regarding the undistributed earnings of its Japan subsidiaries. The earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered permanently reinvested. As a result, in 2009 the company provided deferred U.S. income taxes of $

28.0 million, offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $34.4 million.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

As of December 31, 2010, the company had $62.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.

The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.3 million for interest.

The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2001.

During 2010 and 2009, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, all of which reduced income tax expense. During 2008, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $3.0 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which reduced goodwill.

Income Taxes (continued)

In 2010, the company settled a Swiss audit of one of its subsidiary’s 2006 and 2007 tax years which resulted in a $8.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The company also settled the IRS audit of its 2007 tax year and the IRS completed the examination phase of its 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries in 2010 which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Completion of the audits of the 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries is pending appeals at the IRS. In addition, the company settled various state income tax audits during 2010, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
The company does not currently expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

In 2009, the company settled the IRS audit of its 2005 tax year which resulted in a $0.9 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. In 2008, the company settled IRS audits of the 2004 and 2005 pre-acquisition tax years of Fisher, which resulted in a $7 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill. This decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was substantially offset by an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits related to the sale of a non-U.S. subsidiary.

The company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 to 2004 tax years. Completion of the audit of those years is subject to appeals at the IRS. The company does not currently expect any signifi
cant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits. The company is also currently under audit by the IRS for the 2008 tax year. It is likely that the examination phase of this audit will be completed within 18 months. There were no significant changes to the status of these examinations during 2010.

Earnings per Share (continued)

Since the company must settle the par value of its convertible notes in cash, the company is not required to include any shares underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the $40.20 conversion price for the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 and only to the extent of the additional shares the company may be required to issue in the event the company’s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the notes or debentures converted (Note 9). At such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) are included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds th
e conversion price.

The table below discloses the effect of changes in the company’s stock price on the amount of shares to be included in the earnings per share calculation. The securities are convertible only if the common stock price equals or exceeds the trigger price. The table assumes normal conversion for the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 in which the principal amount is paid in cash, and the excess up to the conversion value is paid in shares of the company’s stock as follows:

Debt and Other Financing Arrangements (continued)

Short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $3.7 million and $1.9 million at year-end 2010 and 2009, respectively, of short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 10.63% and 11.42% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreement, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $69.6 million as of December 31, 2010. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.

In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. Interest on the short-term debt would have been computed based on one of several Federal Funds or LIBOR-based rates, the most favorable of which was 1.75% at December 31, 2010. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes (see Note 17), primarily to fund the pending acquisition of Dionex, and terminated the short-term financing commitment.

Credit Facilities

The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit that will expire in August 2012.

The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The rate at December 31, 2010, was between 0.44% and 0.65% (depending on duration) under the more favorable of the two rates. The revolving credit facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenant requires the compa
ny to maintain total leverage below a certain maximum level. The company was in compliance with all covenants between 2008 and 2010. The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings under the revolver and $48.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $951.7 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility.

2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

At the November 2006 closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023. Interest on the notes was payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The notes were convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $23.73 per share, if the common stock price exceeded the trigger price of $28.48 for a period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company made a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all outstanding 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 at a purchase price per $1,000 principal amount of $2,072.4743. At the expiration of the offer, the company purchased $282.3 million aggregate principal amount of such notes for an aggregate of $586.6 million including accrued and unpaid interest. The company recorded a loss of $10 million in 2009 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other expense, net on the accompanying statement of income. During 2010, the company purchased all of the remaining $13 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 for an aggregate of $28 million.

Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033

At the closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $344.4 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033. Interest on the notes was payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year at an annual rate of 90-day LIBOR minus 1.25%. The notes were convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $29.55 per share, if the common stock price exceeds the trigger price of $38.41 for a period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.

During 2010, following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company’s Floating Rate Convertible Senior Debentures due 2033 exercised conversion rights for the remaining $326 million in par value. The company paid the principal and the premium due upon conversion in cash for a total outlay of $573 million.

3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024

At the closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $330.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024. Interest on the notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $40.20 per share, if the common stock price exceeds the trigger price of $48.24 for a period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The company will be required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion, up to the principal amount of notes converted. The company will have the option to satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount in cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or
 in part, at the company’s option, on or after March 2, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, holders of the notes have the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the company to purchase any notes held by them for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on March 1, 2011, March 1, 2016 and March 1, 2021, or upon a change of control.

For any holders of the company’s convertible obligations electing to convert or if such debt is put to the company by holders on the next put date in 2011, the company currently intends to finance the cash payments that would be payable through borrowings under its revolving credit agreement to the extent such payments exceed $100 million which has been classified as a current maturity of long-term obligation in the accompanying 2010 balance sheet.

The company separately accounts for the debt and equity components of its convertible debt in a manner that reflects the company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized.

On November 20, 2009, the company issued $350 million principal amount of 2.15% Senior Notes due 2012. Interest on the notes is payable on June 28 and December 28 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

At the issuance of debt, the company entered into 3 month LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 2.15% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of 3 month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 0.4194% (0.72% at December 31, 2010) and to receive a fixed interest rate of 2.15%. The variable interest rate resets quarterly. The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 2.15% Notes.

3.25% Senior Notes due 2014

On November 20, 2009, the company issued $400 million principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2014. Interest on the notes is payable on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

At the issuance of debt, the company entered into 3 month LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 3.25% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 3.25% Notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of 3 month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 0.7245% (1.01% at December 31, 2010) and to receive a fixed interest rate of 3.25%. The variable interest rate resets quarterly. The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 3.25% Notes.

3.20% Senior Notes due 2015

On April 27, 2010, the company issued $450 million principal amount of 3.20% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

At the issuance of debt, the company entered into six-month LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 3.20% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 3.20% Notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of six-month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 0.4512% (0.90% at December 31, 2010) and to receive a fixed interest rate of 3.20%. The variable interest rate resets semi-annually. The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 3.20% Notes.

5% Senior Notes due 2015

In 2005, the company issued $250 million principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

Prior to issuing this debt, the company entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to inter
est expense over the term of the debt through 2015.

4.70% Senior Notes due 2020

On April 27, 2010, the company issued $300 million principal amount of 4.70% Senior Notes due 2020. Interest on the notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

6 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014

At the closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $300 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest on the notes was payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 103.375% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in December 2009 for a total cash outlay of $317 million. The company recorded a loss of $5 million in 2009 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other expense, net on the accompanying statement of income.

6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015

At the closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $500 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes was payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 103.063% of the principal amount in July 2010 for a total cash outlay of $515 million plus accrued interest. The company recorded a loss of $15 million in 2010 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other expense, net on the accompanying statement of income.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $96.4 million at December 31, 2010, including $3.9 million for businesses that have been sold. The expiration of these credits and guarantees ranges through 2099.

Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $46.7 million at December 31, 2010. The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2013.

The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.

In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to indemnification by the buyer.

The company has funding commitments totaling $6.2 million at December 31, 2010, related to investments it owns.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.

Litigation and Related Contingencies

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract, commercial and other issues. In view of the company’s financial condition and the accruals established for related matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 10.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.

The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2010, was approximately $214 million to $307 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s reserve for these matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $156 million at December 31, 2010 (or $217 million undiscounted). The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $99 million a
t December 31, 2010 (or $137 million undiscounted). The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2010, the company had product liability reserves of $8 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.

The assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of approximately $61 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $37 million (net discount $24 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.

Although the company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facili
ties were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value. This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The remaining discount of $8 million 
is being accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $22 million and $23 million, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Management believes that its reserves for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the company expects to incur. As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Alth
ough these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.

Comprehensive Income and Shareholders’ Equity (continued)

The company has distributed rights under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement 
of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired i
n a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock). The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.

As a result of the November 2006 merger with Fisher, warrants to purchase shares of Fisher common stock were converted into warrants to purchase 3,307,170 shares of company common stock at an exercise price of $4.83 per share. These warrants had a fair value of $113.2 million at the merger date, which was recorded as part of the merger consideration. All of the outstanding warrants were exercised in January 2008.

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair Value Measurements

The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2010. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in money market funds, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the company’s currency and interest rate risks and other investments in unit trusts and insurance contracts held as assets to satisfy outstanding retirement liabilities.

The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.

Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.

The cost of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments were nominal in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

In addition to available-for-sale investments, the company had $4.3 million and $1.7 million of trading securities, consisting of debt and equity securities, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The company determines the fair value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from brokers/dealers. During 2009, the company recorded in other expense, net, $0.3 million of impairment charge on the auction rate securities for declines in value deemed attributable to credit losses exceeding six to nine months duration and thus considered other-than-temporary. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment. Changes to the fair value are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

Restructuring costs in 2010 in both segments primarily included charges for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues in several businesses, as well as the consolidation of manufacturing and research and development operations at a site in Germany with an existing site in the U.S. and the consolidation of production operations at a plant in Iowa with plants in Ohio and North Carolina. The 2010 charges include asset impairments as discussed below. Restructuring costs in 2009 in both segments primarily included charges for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues in several businesses, as well as the following: consolidation of production operations at a plant in the United Kingdom with plants in the U.S. and Germany; the Iowa an
d Germany closures discussed above; the consolidation of operations at a plant in the Netherlands with plants in the United Kingdom and the U.S; and completion of the relocation of a manufacturing site in France to an existing site in Germany. Restructuring costs in 2008 included reductions in headcount within several businesses due to economic uncertainty affecting end markets and consolidating or transferring manufacturing operations from various sites in Europe, the U.S. and Australia to other sites. The 2008 costs also included charges for asset impairment, litigation and other matters discussed by segment below, net of pension curtailment gains.

As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million, primarily in the first half of 2011.

Subsequent Events

Planned Sale of Businesses

In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena), part of the Analytical Technologies segment, for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster), part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $200 million in cash. Revenues and operating income of the two businesses aggregated approximately $225 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2010.

Athena

provides diagnostic testing for neurological and other diseases, with an emphasis on gene-based tests. Lancaster is a contract-testing laboratory that provides analytical laboratory services. The sales are subject to regulatory approvals an
d other closing conditions.

Issuance of Debt

On February 22, 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion principal amount of senior notes, as detailed below, to fund its pending acquisition of Dionex (see Note 2) and for general corporate purposes. All of these notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption provision. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem all of the notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Subsequent Events (continued)

2.05% Senior Notes due 2014

On February 22, 2011, the company issued $300 million principal amount of 2.05% Senior Notes due 2014. Interest on the notes is payable on February 21 and August 21 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

At the issuance of debt, the company entered into six-month LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 2.05% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 2.05% Notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of six-month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 0.4112% (0.88% at February 22, 2011) and to receive a fixed interest rate of 2.05%. The variable interest rate resets semi-annually. The swaps will be accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 2.05% Notes.

3.20% Senior Notes due 2016

On February 22, 2011, the company issued $900 million principal amount of 3.20% Senior Notes due 2016. Interest on the notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

4.50% Senior Notes due 2021

On February 22, 2011, the company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021. Interest on the notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.
