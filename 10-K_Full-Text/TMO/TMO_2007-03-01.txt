General
            Development of Business

Thermo
            Fisher Scientific Inc. (also referred to in this document as “Thermo Fisher,”
“we,” the “company,” or the “registrant”)

is
            the
            world leader in serving science

.

We

enable
            our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by providing
            analytical instruments, equipment, reagents and consumables, software
            and
            services for research, manufacturing, analysis, discovery and
            diagnostics.

In
            November 2006, Thermo Electron Corporation (also referred to in this
            document as
“Thermo,” which is the predecessor to Thermo Fisher) merged with Fisher
            Scientific International Inc. (also referred to in this document as “Fisher”) to
            create the world leader in serving science.

Thermo
            Fisher has 30,500 employees and serves more than 350,000 customers within
            pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic
            labs,
            universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well
            as
            environmental, industrial quality and process control settings.

We
            deliver a broad selection of analytical instruments, equipment, consumables
            and
            laboratory supplies. Our growing portfolio of products includes innovative
            technologies for mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, molecular spectroscopy,
            sample preparation, informatics, fine and high-purity chemistry production,
            cell
            culture, RNA interference analysis and immunodiagnostic testing, as well
            as air
            and water quality monitoring and process control. We also give our customers
            convenient purchasing options, through our 7,500 sales and service
            professionals, numerous catalogs and e-commerce capabilities.

We
            are
            continuously advancing the capabilities of our technologies, software
            and
            services, as well as our supply-chain management expertise. Our goal
            is to make
            our customers more productive and to enable them to solve their analytical
            challenges, from routine testing to complex research and discovery.

In
            the
            late 1980s, Thermo adopted a strategy of spinning out certain businesses
            into
            separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority ownership. By
            1997, we
            had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse markets. To simplify
            our
            structure, we announced in January 2000 a major reorganization that ultimately
            resulted in taking private all of our public subsidiaries, selling non-core
            businesses and spinning off our paper recycling and medical products
            businesses.
            As part of the reorganization, we divested of businesses with aggregate
            annual
            revenues of over $2 billion. This reorganization was substantially completed
            in
            February 2002, when we took private our last publicly traded subsidiary.
            In July
            2004, we sold Spectra-Physics, Inc., our optical technologies
            segment.

The
            businesses spun off and sold have been accounted for as discontinued
            operations.
            Except where indicated, the information presented in this report pertains
            to our
            continuing operations.

Thermo
            Fisher is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 1956. The company
            completed its initial public offering in 1967 and was listed on the New
            York
            Stock Exchange in 1980.

Mass
            spectrometry is a technique for analyzing chemical compounds, individually
            or in
            complex mixtures, by forming gas phase charged ions that are then analyzed
            according to mass-to-charge ratios. In addition to molecular information,
            each
            discrete chemical compound generates a fragmentation pattern that provides
            structurally diagnostic information. Chromatography is a technique for
            separating, identifying and quantifying individual chemical components
            of
            substances based on physical and chemical characteristics specific to
            each
            component. Optical spectroscopy is a technique for analyzing individual
            chemical
            components of substances based on the absorption or emission of electromagnetic
            radiation of a specific wavelength of light, for example, visible (light),
            ultraviolet or infra-red.

            Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). Deployment of these systems
            at port and border locations globally is designed to detect and deter
            the
            importation of illicit nuclear devices or radiological materials. The
            ASPs are
            designed to allow Customs and other agencies to instantly detect and
            identify
            sources of radiation to a specific energy fingerprint, thus increasing
            the
            probability of deterring a threat, without a slowdown in commerce.

Accurate
            measurement and dispensing of samples and reagents is critical in a variety
            of
            industrial, academic, government, and clinical laboratories. We have
            a wide
            variety of single and multiple channel pipetting tools from manual to
            highly
            automated, covering a wide volume range. The ergonomics of these devices
            are
            important to the comfort of researchers handling numerous samples and
            pipetting
            steps on a daily basis. Due to sample cross-contamination concerns, the
            tips of
            the pipettes are disposable and a separate tip is used for each sample.
            These
            products are sold under various brands and product line names including

Sales
            and Marketing

We
            market
            and sell our products and services through a direct sales force,
            customer-service professionals, electronic commerce, third-party distributors
            and various catalogs.

We
            have
            approximately 7,500 sales and service professionals including over 1,000
            highly
            trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs
            of our more
            technical end-users. We also provide customers with an efficient ordering
            system, product standardization and other supply-chain-management services

            include entry into new business segments. We are not currently committed
            to any
            new products that require the investment of a material amount of our
            funds, nor
            do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require
            such
            an investment.

                  of Contents

During
            2006, 2005 and 2004, we spent $170 million, $153 million and $135 million,
            respectively, on research and development, excluding a charge in 2006
            of $15
            million for in-process research and development at the date of the merger
            with
            Fisher.

Raw
            Materials

Our
            management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw
            materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We
            do not
            anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to
            our
            business.

Raw-material
            and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions.
            We employ
            many strategies, including the use of alternative materials and the use
            of
            derivative instruments, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations
            on our
            results.

Patents,
            Licenses and Trademarks

Patents
            are important in both segments of our business. No particular patent,
            or related
            group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly
            affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection
            for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated
            into our
            products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest. Patent rights
            resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue
            exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or
            contracts.

We
            protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate,
            we use
            trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We
            also
            enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights
            to
            patents and know-how.

Seasonal
            Influences

Revenues
            in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the
            other
            quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical
            and
            government customers.

Working
            Capital Requirements

There
            are
            no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers
            that
            would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency
            on a Single Customer

There
            is
            no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect
            on our
            business. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues
            in any
            of the past three years.

Backlog

Our
            backlog of firm orders at year-end 2006 and 2005 was as follows:

            filled
            during 2007. The increase in backlog in 2006 is principally due to the
            Fisher
            merger and, to a lesser extent, increased demand.

Government
            Contracts

Although
            the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government
            contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination
            of
            the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material
            adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

Competition

General

The
            company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of
            the
            markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services,
            we face
            many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors
            include

a
            broad
            range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.

In
            general, competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized
            by
            changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research
            and
            development. Our success in these markets primarily depends on the following
            factors:

·

technical
                      performance and advances in technology that result in new products
                      and

Environmental

Matters

We
            are
            subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental
            matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other
            countries.
            U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic
            Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the
            Clean
            Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive
            Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). We are also
            subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
            (“OSHA”) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States
            Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), OSHA, and other federal agencies have
            the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our
            operations.

In
            addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated
            certain
            authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having
            authority
            over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments
            have
            adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations,
            some
            of which are similar to federal requirements.

A
            number
            of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of
            substances
            that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within
            the
            meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of

environmental
            harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other
            companies
            engaged in similar businesses.

Table
                  of Contents

Our
            expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing
            compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information,
            we
            believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical
            remediation
            obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting,
            installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems
            and
            other remedial measures. We estimate our aggregate expenses for these
            environmental remediation matters will be approximately $1 million per
            year.

Our
            Fair
            Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative
            consent orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
            in 1984. Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation
            and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) corrective action program administered by the Illinois
            Environmental Protection Agency. We are required to maintain
            groundwater-remediation activities at these sites. As the owner of the
            Fair Lawn
            facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation
            within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site. This site
            was
            listed in 1983 on the National Priority List under CERCLA. Both New Jersey
            sites
            are also the subjects of CERCLA National Resources Damages claims.

We
            record
            accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations
            of
            environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability
            has been
            incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
            We
            calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared
            by
            environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these
            environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs
            for
            investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.

Accrued
            liabilities for environmental matters totaled $24 million at December
            31, 2006
            and were not material prior to the merger with Fisher. The liability
            for
            environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date
            of merger
            at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present
            value.

These
            environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which
            we may
            be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental
            liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result, we believe that
            our
            ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have
            a
            material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
            or cash
            flows. However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance
            costs due
            to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes
            in
            agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation
            technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect
            of
            changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect
            on our
            financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory
            Affairs

Our
            operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number
            of
            complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production,
            handling,
            transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar
            products,
            including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug
            Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
            and
            Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards
            of
            pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo
            Fisher’s
            businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject
            to
            pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and
            Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the
            rules and
            regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation
            Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are
            in
            compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any
            noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict
            our
            ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have
            an adverse
            effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact
            on
            our operations.

Risk

Factors

Set
            forth
            below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This
            section
            contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation
            of the
            qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning
            on page
            3.

We
            must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological
            change
            and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive.

Our
            growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for
            product
            development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized
            by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product
            and service
            introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without
            the
            timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products
            and
            services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which
            case
            our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Development
            of our products requires significant investment; our products and technologies
            could become uncompetitive or obsolete.

Our
            customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their
            own
            products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop
            products
            in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to
            adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest
            heavily in research and development of products and services that do
            not lead to
            significant revenue.

Many
            of
            our existing products and those under development are technologically
            innovative
            and require significant planning, design, development and testing at
            the
            technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. These activities
            require us to make significant investments.

Products
            in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because
            of
            quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products
            and
            technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive
            or
            obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies
            and changes
            in

requirements than we can. The products that we are currently
            developing

,
            or
            those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible
            or
            accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become
            uncompetitive or obsolete.

It
            may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal
            growth.

Some
            of
            the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the
            past
            several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies
            to
            improve our internal growth, including:

·

finding
                      new markets for our products;

·

developing
                      new applications for our technologies;

·

combining
                      sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete
                      more
                      effectively;

·

allocating
                      research and development funding to products with higher growth
                      prospects;

·

continuing
                      key customer initiatives;

·

expanding
                      our service offerings;

·

strengthening
                      our presence in selected geographic markets; and

·

continuing
                      the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase
                      and
                      support cross-selling opportunities of products and services
                      to take
                      advantage of our breadth in product
                      offerings.

We
            may
            not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies
            may
            not result in the growth of our business.

The
            company may be unable to integrate successfully the legacy businesses
            of Thermo
            Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. and may
            be unable
            to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The
            merger involved the combination of two companies which previously operated
            as
            independent public companies. The company is required to devote significant
            management attention and resources to integrating its business practices
            and
            operations. Potential difficulties the company may encounter in the integration
            process include the following:

·

if
                      we are unable to successfully combine the businesses of Thermo
                      and Fisher
                      in a manner that permits the company to achieve the cost savings
                      and
                      operating synergies anticipated to result from the merger,
                      such
                      anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully
                      or at all or
                      may take longer to realize than
                      expected;

lost
                      sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either
                      of the two
                      former companies deciding not to do business with the
                      company;

performance
                      shortfalls at the company as a result of the diversion of management’s
                      attention to the merger; and

·

inability
                      to successfully execute a branding campaign for the combined
                      company.

In
            addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in
            the loss
            of key employees, the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum
            in,
            the company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls,
            procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability
            to
            maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to
            achieve
            the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings
            or
            otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the
            company.

Our
            inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material
            adverse
            effect on our business. In

addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual
            property,
            and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a
            result.

We place
            considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection
            for
            significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length
            of
            time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development
            process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our
            ability to
            develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection
            for our
            products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous
            U.S.
            and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as
            appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued
            for
            any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us,
            and the
            claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad
            to protect
            our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be
            challenged,
            invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not
            provide
            us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around
            our
            technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights
            may
            also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could
            make it
            easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could
            incur
            substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or
            in suits in
            which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable
            outcome of
            any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and
            results
            of operations.

We
            also
            rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to
            protect our
            products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators,
            employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may
            not have
            adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may
            otherwise
            become known or be independently developed by our competitors.

Third
            parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing
            on
            their intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2004 Applied
            Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit
            against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held
            by the
            plaintiffs. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management
            resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse
            effect
            on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
            parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial
            damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could
            effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market
            our
            products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that
            a claim
            relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties
            not
            affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our
            products or
            technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge
            those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on
            commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents
            may
            be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other
            rights
            could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products
            and,
            therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
            condition and results of operations.

Demand
            for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our
            customers
            and on government funding policies.

Our
            customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories,
            universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and
            private
            research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending
            priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have
            a
            significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
            These
            policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our
            products.

Our
            results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future
            benefits
            from new productivity initiatives.

We
            continue to pursue practical process improvement (PPI) programs and other
            cost
            saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance
            our
            productivity, efficiency and customer satisfaction. While we anticipate
            continued benefits from these initiatives, future benefits are expected
            to be
            fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve.

Our
            business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties
            affecting markets in which we operate. Adverse economic conditions could
            adversely impact our business in 2007 and beyond, resulting
            in:

·

reduced
            demand for some of our products;

·

increased
            rate of order cancellations or delays;

·

increased
            risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

·

increased
            pressure on the prices for our products and services; and

·

greater
            difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.

Changes
            in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase
            our
            expenses.

We
            compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with
            federal,
            state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health
            and
            safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market
            our
            products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant
            change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase
            our
            expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the
            pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
            Changes in
            the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and
            development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these
            products.

If
            any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation,
            we could be
            exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not
            have
            adequate insurance coverage.

The
            products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive
            range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation
            and trace
            explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies,
            cargo
            facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the
            detection
            and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction,
            it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through
            the
            product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There
            are also
            many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims,
            such
            as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training
            of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against
            us could be
            significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in
            excess of
            our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance,
            we cannot
            be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these
            claims
            or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our
            inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully
            integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse
            effect
            on our business.

Our
            business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses
            that
            complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions
            are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including
            competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including
            antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully
            complete
            transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial
            premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company.
            Further,
            we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully
            into our
            existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated
            cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could
            adversely affect our business.

Moreover,
            we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these
            acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet,
            which
            amounts to approximately $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2006. We assess
            the
            realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as
            whenever
            events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be
            impaired.
            These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
            significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business
            or asset.
            Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future
            cash
            flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on
            how well
            we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the
            value of
            the goodwill, we may be required to incur material charges relating to
            the
            impairment of those assets.

Our
            growth strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the
            integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to
            our
            ongoing operations.

We
            have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold.

From
            through 2004, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues
            in
            excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility
            for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such
            as
            lawsuits, product liability and environmental claims and potential claims
            by
            buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses
            were
            inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material
            adverse
            effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however,
            we can not
            be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.

As
            a
            multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency
            exchange
            rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of
            operations.

International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues,
            and we
            intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In
            2006, our
            international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues
            from the United States, accounted for approximately 46% of our total
            revenues.
            The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different
            forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations
            in
            exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability
            in
            U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international
            markets,
            where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.
            As a
            multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party
            customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do
            business
            (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the
            functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results
            of
            operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by
            our
            international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial
            reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our
            international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange
            rates
            could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2006, currency
            translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations
            of
            $18 million due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies
            in which the company sells products and services.

We
            are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and
            failure
            to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts
            could
            harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with
            these
            customers.

We
            have
            agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities
            and, as a
            result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply
            to
            companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government
            contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government
            contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable
            to
            private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance
            with the
            regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with
            these
            regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal,
            civil and
            administrative penalties or debarment.

Because
            we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product
            suppliers,
            our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term
            if these
            customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their
            relationship with us.

Our
            largest customer

in
            the
            laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics
            business are also significant competitors. Our business may be harmed
            in the
            short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these
            customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In
            addition,
            we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source
            from
            third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple
            suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term
            if any of
            our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products
            to
            us.

Because
            we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant
            disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt
            our
            ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our
            profitability

.

We
            ship a
            significant portion of our products to our customers through independent
            package
            delivery companies, such as UPS and Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL
            in
            Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery
            of
            our products and ship our products through other carriers, including
            national
            and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S.
            Postal
            Service. If UPS or another third-party package-delivery provider experiences
            a
            major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in
            a timely
            fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not
            pass on to
            our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain
            of
            our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if UPS or our
            other
            third-party package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not
            able to
            find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network,
            our
            profitability could be adversely affected.

We
            are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies
            that
            require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations, including those
            regarding the manufacture of products, the shipping of our products and
            environmental matters.

Some
            of
            our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration and similar international agencies. These regulations
            govern a
            wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling,
            manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply
            with the
            U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations or those of similar
            international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their
            manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce
            our
            revenues.

We
            are
            subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations
            that
            govern the handling, transportation, manufacture, use or sale of substances
            that
            are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances. Some risk
            of
            environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we
            manufacture, sell or distribute. This requires us to devote significant
            resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and
            regulations, including the establishment of reserves to address potential
            environmental costs, and manage environmental risks.

We
            rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell,
            and
            our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing
            operations.

We
            rely
            upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we
            sell. Any
            significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes
            or
            other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other
            events
            beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships
            and therefore adversely affect our business. Although most of our raw
            materials
            are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also
            depend
            upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we
            are unable
            to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be
            able to
            produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain
            of
            these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect
            on our

            which could adversely affect our business.

The
            healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to
            reduce
            costs. These changes include:

•

development of large and sophisticated groups purchasing medical and
            surgical
            supplies;

•

wider
            implementation of managed care;

•

legislative healthcare reform;

•

consolidation of pharmaceutical companies;

•

increased outsourcing of certain activities, including to low-cost offshore
            locations; and

•

consolidation of distributors of pharmaceutical, medical and surgical
            supplies.

We
            expect
            the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future.
            Some
            of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental support
            of
            healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations
            governing
            the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or mandated benefits,
            may cause
            healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and
            services
            or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or
            services.

We
            may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices,
            which
            could reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Our
            primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins, steel
            and
            serum. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through
            higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings
            and
            cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are
            insufficient to cover our costs.

Unforeseen
            problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems
            could interfere with our operations.

As
            a part
            of the effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing
            new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications
            to
            manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add
            functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems
            could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner:
            provide quotes, take customer orders, ship products, provide services
            and
            support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual
            obligations and otherwise run our business. In addition, if our new systems
            fail
            to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures,
            it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result,
            our
            results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our
            debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment
            opportunities or limit our activities.

As
            of
            December 31, 2006, we had approximately $2.7 billion in outstanding
            indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur an additional
            $635
            million of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. We may also
            obtain
            additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing
            needs,
            which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our
            leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our
            vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our
            ability
            to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new
            products
            and technologies through strategic acquisitions.

Our
            ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance
            and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our
            control.
            Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations.
            If
            we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we
            may be
            forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research
            and
            development expenditures. We may not be able to obtain additional financing
            on
            terms acceptable to us or at all.

Additionally,
            the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial
            ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict
            our
            activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur
            additional
            indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into
            transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility
            include a debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed
            that, so
            long as any lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan
            or other
            obligation is outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit
            is
            outstanding under the new facility, it will not permit (as the following
            terms
            are defined in the new facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the
            ratio of
            consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day
            of any
            fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.

Our
            ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is
            dependent
            on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions
            and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such
            as foreign
            exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of
            these
            restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the
            applicable
            debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that
            instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due
            date.
            Also, an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments

would
            trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

Corporate
            Headquarters

We
            own
            approximately 81

,000
            square feet of office space in Massachusetts. We also own approximately
            100,000
            square feet of office space in New Hampshire which was the former corporate
            headquarters of Fisher.

We
            believe that all of the facilities that we are currently utilizing are
            in good
            condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. If
            we are
            unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2007 or 2008,
            we
            believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially
            reasonable terms.

Legal

Proceedings

On
            September 3, 2004, Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS
            Scientific Instruments filed a complaint against the company in U.S.
            District
            Court for the District of Delaware, Civil Action No. 04-1230-GMS. These
            plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems, including its
            triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems, infringe U.S.
            patent
            number 4,963,736 entitled “Mass Spectrometer and Method and Improved Ion
            Transmission.” The plaintiffs seek damages, including treble damages for alleged
            willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive
            relief. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on
            the
            company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

On
            December 8, 2004 and February 23, 2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits
            in
            the same Delaware court, that one or more of the plaintiffs in the above
            action
            infringe two patents of the company

(U.S.
            patent number 5,385,654 entitled “Controlled Temperature Anion Separation by
            Capillary Electrophoresis” and U.S. patent number 6,528,784 entitled “Mass
            Spectrometer System Including a Double Ion Guide Interface and Method
            of
            Operation”).

The
            lawsuits brought by the company seek relief similar to that being sought
            by the
            plaintiffs.

Our
            business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the
            ordinary
            course of business. We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings,
            including consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products
            we may
            have distributed or manufactured. These matters have arisen in the ordinary
            course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions.
            We believe
            that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing
            of many of
            these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in
            part by
            insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject
            to
            indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers. Management, after review
            and
            consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with
            respect
            to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results
            of
            operations, financial position or cash flows. While liabilities arising
            from
            potential future claims could become material, we currently believe,
            on the
            basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential
            future
            claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial
            condition and results of operations. Actual costs incurred will depend
            on the
            solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect
            to any
            particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency
            of
            third parties who may be jointly and severally liable. See “Item 1 —
Business — Environmental Matters,” for legal proceedings involving certain
            environmental matters.

We
            are
            subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including,
            among
            others, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agency for
            International Development. Various governmental agencies conduct investigations
            from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations. Some
            operations
            involve and have involved the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances
            that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning
            of
            applicable environmental laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental
            and
            other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it
            is with
            other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot assure that
            material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will
            not be
            determined to be material in the future.

On
                      February 28

,
                      2006, the company announced a repurchase program authorizing
                      the purchase
                      of up to $100 million of the company’s common stock in the open market or
                      in negotiated transactions. On May 7, 2006, the company increased
                      the
                      existing authorization for the purchase of up to an additional
                      $200
                      million of the company’s common stock in the open market or in negotiated
                      transactions. All of the shares of common stock repurchased
                      by the company
                      during the fourth quarter of 2006 were purchased under this
                      program. At
                      December 31, 2006, no remaining authorization existed for future
                      repurchases. In February 2007, the company’s Board of Directors authorized
                      the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s common stock through
                      February 28, 2008.

                      under which amortization of goodwill

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results

            Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
            to
            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of
            this
            report.

Thermo
            Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. announced
            on May
            8, 2006 that the boards of directors of both companies had unanimously
            approved
            a definitive agreement to combine the two companies in a tax-free,
            stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of
            products and services to the scientific research community and clinical
            laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services
            to
            customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary
            RNAi
            technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable
            supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. The transaction
            was
            approved by both companies’ shareholders, in separate meetings, held on August
            30, 2006 and, following regulatory approvals, was completed on November
            9, 2006.
            Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from
            November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo
            Fisher
            Scientific Inc.

Overview
            of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The
            company develops

,
            manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
            The
            company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing
            and
            commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions
            of complementary businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics,
            its
            optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued
            operations
            in the accompanying financial statements. Following the merger with Fisher,
            the
            company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments:
            Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues
            in the
            fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to
            capital
            spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government
            customers.

The
            company’s revenues grew by 44% during 2006, including 32% from the Fisher
            merger. The weakening of the dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies also
            caused
            an increase in reported revenues. In addition to the change in revenues
            caused
            by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency translation, which
            are
            discussed below, sales increased 6% in 2006, primarily due to increased
            demand
            and, to a lesser extent, higher prices.

The
            company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with
            complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2006 and 2005.
            In addition
            to the merger with Fisher, the principal acquisitions included Cohesive
            Technologies Inc., a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid
            chromatography products in December 2006; GV Instruments Limited, a manufacturer
            of isotope ratio mass spectrometers, which was acquired in July 2006;
            EGS
            Gauging, Inc., a provider of flat polymer web gauging products, which
            was
            acquired in June 2006; Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an ion-filtering
            device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August 2005;
            the
            Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider of
            a wide
            range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and
            storage,
            which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a
            provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the
            ambient
            air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which was acquired
            in
            April 2005; and Niton LLC, a provider of portable X-ray analyzers to
            the metals,
            petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March
            2005.

In
            2006,
            the company’s operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and
            6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively,
            in 2005.
            (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The
            decrease
            in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million
            of
            pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger, described below, and
            $93
            million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher
            merger.
            These items were offset in part by the inclusion of Fisher’s results from
            November 9, 2006 and higher profitability at existing businesses due
            to
            increased revenues, productivity improvements including lower costs following
            restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The company’s
            effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
            The
            decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily
            due
            to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United
            States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset
            by
            non-deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in
            includes $4 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years
            in a
            non-U.S. country. This charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005
            by 1.5
            percentage points.

Income
            from continuing operations decreased to $166 million in 2006, from $198
            million
            in 2005, primarily due to the items discussed above that reduced operating
            income in 2006 and the inclusion of gains on the sale of investments
            in 2005,
            offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in 2006.

During
            2006, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $406 million, compared
            with $271 million in 2005. The increase resulted from improved cash flow
            at
            existing business and, to a lesser extent, cash flow from the Fisher
            business,
            net of $157 million in merger-related operating cash outflows including
            severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred
            by
            Fisher that were paid subsequent to November 9, 2006.

            2006,
            the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.7 billion, of which 77% is due in 2009
            and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short-term
            investments of $691 million as of December 31, 2006, and the company’s future
            cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing
            capacity
            of up to $635 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit agreement
            are
            sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses
            for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

Critical
            Accounting Policies

The
            company

’s
            discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
            is
            based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
            with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
            The
            preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make
            estimates
            and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
            revenue
            and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an
            on-going
            basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to
            equity
            investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations,
            intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs,
            contingencies and litigation, equity-based compensation, restructuring
            and sale
            of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience,
            current
            market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management
            believes
            are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments
            about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are
            not
            readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
            estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The
            company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies
            and
            estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts
                      Receivable

The
                      company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
                      losses
                      resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts
                      due. Such
                      allowances totaled $45 million at December 31, 2006. The company
                      estimates
                      the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based
                      on the age
                      of the

receivable,
                      the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information
                      that is
                      relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the
                      company’s
                      customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make
                      payments,
                      additional allowances would be
                      required.

(b)

Inventories

The
                      company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
                      for
                      differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value
                      taking
                      into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected
                      demand and
                      any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If
                      ultimate usage
                      or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand,
                      additional
                      writedowns may be required.

(c)

Intangible
                      Assets and Goodwill

The
                      company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair
                      value of
                      assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
                      A
                      significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s
                      acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require
                      that use of
                      significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii)
                      whether such
                      intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the
                      former, the
                      period and the method by which the intangible asset will be
                      amortized. The
                      company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible
                      assets
                      principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise
                      from
                      identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The
                      projected cash
                      flows are discounted to determine the present value of the
                      assets at the
                      dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled
                      $6.18 billion
                      at December 31, 2006. Actual cash flows arising from a particular
                      intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which
                      could imply
                      different carrying values and annual amortization expense from
                      those
                      established at the dates of acquisition and which could result
                      in
                      impairment of such asset. The company reviews other intangible
                      assets for
                      impairment when indication of potential impairment exists,
                      such as a
                      significant reduction in cash flows associated with the
                      assets.

The
                      company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
                      assets for
                      impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances
                      change that may
                      reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using
                      forecasts of
                      discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that
                      might require
                      an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions,
                      economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive
                      activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and
                      courts.
                      Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.52
                      billion and
                      $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Estimates
                      of future
                      cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating
                      income
                      growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels
                      and other
                      factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis
                      could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation
                      of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the company’s
                      goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because
                      of reduced
                      operating performance, market declines, or other indicators
                      of impairment,
                      or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for
                      impairment may
                      be necessary.

Other
                      Long-Lived Assets

The
                      company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when
                      indication of
                      potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction
                      in cash flows
                      associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled
                      $1.57 billion
                      at December 31, 2006, including $1.26 billion of fixed assets.
                      In testing
                      a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning
                      projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of
                      future cash
                      flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating
                      income growth
                      and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being
                      reviewed
                      for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly
                      from
                      estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived
                      assets may
                      be necessary.

Revenues

In
                      instances where the company sells equipment with a related
                      installation
                      obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related
                      to the
                      equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue
                      related to the
                      installation when it performs the installation. The allocation
                      of revenue
                      between the equipment and the installation is based on relative
                      fair value
                      at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment
                      or the
                      installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.
                      If fair value is not available for any undelivered element,
                      revenue for
                      all elements is deferred until delivery is
                      completed.

In
                      instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified
                      acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can
                      demonstrate
                      adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance
                      testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If
                      the nature of
                      customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow
                      in
                      complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence,
                      the
                      company would be required to defer additional revenues upon
                      shipment of
                      its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.

The
                      company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products
                      and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license
                      revenue based on the residual method after all elements have
                      either been
                      delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair
                      value
                      exists for

any
                      undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for
                      any
                      undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until
                      delivery
                      is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support
                      contracts are
                      recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
                      VSOE of
                      fair value of software maintenance and support is determined
                      based on the
                      price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
                      Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized
                      as services
                      are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference
                      to the
                      price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

The
                      company records reductions to revenue for estimated product
                      returns by
                      customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be
                      returned,
                      additional adjustments to revenue may be
                      required.

Warranty
                      Obligations

At
                      the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the
                      estimated
                      cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience
                      and
                      knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected
                      warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability
                      for
                      warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $45
                      million at December 31, 2006. Should product failure rates
                      or the actual
                      cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions
                      to the
                      estimated warranty liability would be necessary.

Income
                      Taxes

The
                      company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms
                      and as a
                      result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic
                      and non-U.S.
                      tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties
                      among these
                      governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction
                      requires
                      the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations
                      and the use of
                      estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events,
                      such as the
                      amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue
                      recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character
                      of
                      income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements
                      and
                      treaties, currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations
                      or
                      profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact
                      upon the
                      amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net
                      income.

The
                      company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards
                      will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by
                      tax
                      jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets
                      and loss
                      carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go
                      unused. If it
                      becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward
                      will be
                      used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance
                      with an offset
                      generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from
                      acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $195 million
                      at December 31, 2006. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by
                      tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances
                      or reversals
                      thereof may be necessary.

The
                      company provides a liability for future income tax payments
                      in the
                      worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income
                      taxes
                      totaled $60 million at December 31, 2006. Should tax return
                      positions that
                      the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit,
                      the
                      company could be required to record an incremental tax provision
                      for such
                      taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately
                      be
                      sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would
                      result.

Contingencies
                      and Litigation

The
                      company records accruals for various contingencies, including
                      legal
                      proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and
                      auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise
                      in the normal
                      course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment,
                      historical claims experience, the probability of losses and,
                      where
                      applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or
                      external
                      legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher,
                      including
                      environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair
                      value and as
                      such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally,
                      we record
                      receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been
                      determined to
                      be probable.

                      of these
                      arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate
                      the
                      benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount
                      of which cannot

completely
                      determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions
                      used in the
                      accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount
                      rate,
                      expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee
                      compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company
                      data and
                      appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party
                      actuaries,
                      and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net
                      periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement
                      benefit plans totaled $16 million in 2006 and the company’s unfunded
                      benefit obligation totaled $237 million at year-end 2006. Should
                      any of
                      these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net
                      periodic
                      pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example,
                      a 10%
                      decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase
                      in
                      pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately
                      $2
                      million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately
                      $101
                      million.

                      Compensation

The
                      fair value of each stock option granted by the company is
                      estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use
                      of a valuation
                      model requires management to make certain assumptions with
                      respect to
                      selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility
                      based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock.
                      The expected life of a grant is estimated using the simplified
                      method
                      for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107. The risk-free
                      interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
                      with a
                      remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed
                      at the date of
                      grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount
                      of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The
                      compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards
                      is net of
                      estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture
                      rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures.
                      If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures,
                      adjustments
                      to compensation expense may be
                      required.

Restructuring
                      Costs

The
                      company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating
                      facilities
                      based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income.
                      The
                      company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in
                      continuing operations totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006.
                      Should
                      actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated
                      facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be
                      required.

Assets
                      Held for Sale

The
                      company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held
                      for sale and,
                      when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value
                      of these
                      assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or
                      estimated
                      proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments,
                      vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected
                      amounts.

Sales
            in

            Sales
            increased $978 million due to acquisitions (principally Fisher), net
            of
            divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted
            in an
            increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006. Aside from the effect of
            acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues
            increased
            $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser
            extent,
            price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in
            Asia and
            Europe and moderate in North America.

Consolidated

6.4%

10.0%

In
            2006,
            operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%,
            respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in
            2005. The
            decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125
            million
            of pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger and $93 million of
            higher
            amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125
            million of
            charges includes $73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale
            of
            inventories revalued at the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated
            equity-based compensation due to a change in control occurring at the
            merger
            date and $15 million of in-process research and development at Fisher
            on the
            date of the merger. The unfavorable effect of these items was offset
            in part by
            the inclusion of Fisher’s results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the
            year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased
            revenue,
            productivity improvements, including lower costs following restructuring
            actions
            and, to a lesser extent, price increases.

Restructuring
            and other costs were recorded in 2006 and 2005. Restructuring costs in
            2005 were
            primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting
            from the integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities
            in Texas,
            as well as charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that
            could
            not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided
            reserves
            due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities,
            net of
            expected sub-tenant rental income. Restructuring actions undertaken prior
            to
            2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Aside from the $15
            million
            charge for in-process research and development existing at Fisher on
            the date of
            merger, discussed above, restructuring costs in 2006 include charges
            to close a
            plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an
            acquired
            Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for consolidation of a U.K.
            facility
            into an existing factory in Germany, the move of manufacturing operations in New
            Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe and remaining costs of
            prior
            actions. The company is finalizing its plan for potential restructuring
            actions
            that may be undertaken at Fisher or within existing businesses with which
            Fisher
            is being integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product
            lines,
            consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost
            of
            actions at Fisher businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition,
            while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with
            Fisher is
            charged to expense. The company expects to finalize its restructuring
            plans for
            Fisher no later than one year from the date of merger. The company has
            finalized
            its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business and expects
            that
            charges to expense will ultimately total approximately $16 million, of
            which $15
            million has been recorded as of December 31, 2006, with the balance to
            be
            recorded as incurred. Also, the company has identified actions totaling
            $5
            million that will be undertaken in 2007. The restructuring actions initiated
            in
            2006 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of
            2006 and
            early 2007 of approximately $11 million, including $6 million in the
            Analytical
            Technologies segment and $5 million in the Laboratory Products and Services
            segment.

In
            2006,
            the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million,
            including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75
            million
            for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally
            Fisher) and $3 million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being
            abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million
            of
            cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation
            expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above,
            the
            company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and
            development
            at Fisher on the merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring
            and
            other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues
            of $13
            million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of
            acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily
            for
            severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection
            with the
            integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company
            recorded a gain of $8 million primarily from the sale of six abandoned
            buildings
            and a charge of $2 million principally for the writedown of a building
            held for
            sale (Note 15).

Acquisition-related
            intangible assets of $7.2 billion arose from the merger with Fisher,
            including
            $5.9 billion of amortizable intangible assets. The company expects that
            amortization expense associated with the Fisher intangible assets will
            total
            approximately $470 million per year.

In
            July
            2006, the company acquired GV Instruments Limited (GVI), a UK-based provider
            of
            mass spectrometry instruments and accessories for $17.5 million, net
            of cash
            acquired and a post-closing refund of $4.6 million received in January
            2007.
            Subsequent to the acquisition of GVI, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
            commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it
            qualified
            for consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006,
            the OFT
            referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further
            investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction
            results in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening
            of
            competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly
            gas
            isotope ratio mass spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers
            and
            multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. Of GVI’s sales of
            $19 million in its fiscal 2006, $0.4 million were UK sales. The Competition
            Commission must prepare and publish its report within 24 weeks of the
            reference
            decision unless there are special reasons why it cannot do so. During
            the
            investigation, the company is subject to certain undertakings, which
            took effect
            October 2006, that require it not take any action that will lead to further
            integration of the GVI business with the company or otherwise impair
            the GVI
            business from competing independently. The company is cooperating with
            the
            Competition Commission’s investigation. There can be no assurance as to the
            outcome of this matter. Were the Competition Commission to require that
            the
            company divest of GVI, charges for impairment of assets could result.
            Goodwill
            and intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of GVI
            totaled
            approximately $22 million.

The
            company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating
            income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated
            with
            acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including
            costs
            arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned
            lease
            expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product
            lines;
            amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for
            the
            acceleration of stock option compensation resulting from a change in
            control.
            The company uses these measures because they help management understand
            and
            evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of
            performance for determining compensation (Note 3).

            billion in
            2006. Sales increased $249 million due to the Fisher merger and other
            acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency
            translation
            resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million in 2006. In addition
            to the
            changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency
            translation, revenues increased $160 million (8%) due to higher broad-based
            demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong
            market
            response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth
            was
            particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments
            and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment
            sold in
            commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement.

Operating
            income margin was 15.8% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted
            from
            profit on incremental revenues, and to a lesser extent, price increases
            and
            productivity improvements, including cost-reduction measures following
            restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as
            expense in
            2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%.

Operating
            income margin decreased to 13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily
            due to

            of SFAS
            No. 123R, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements,
            including restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded

            increased
            to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005, primarily due to higher
            invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent,
            increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund
            acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from
            $27 million
            in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to
            a lesser
            extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition
            and
            higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt.

During
            2006 and 2005, the company had gains on investments, net, of $1 million
            and $35
            million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 from the
            sale of
            shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from
            the sale of
            shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the company’s
            investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of
            Thoratec as
            part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the
            shares of
            Newport as part of the sale of Spectra-Physics in 2004. Following the
            sale of
            shares in 2005, the company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport.
            Other
            income in 2006 and 2005 also includes net currency transaction gains
            and equity
            in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Provision
            for Income Taxes

The
            company’s effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
            The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was
            primarily
            due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the
            United
            States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset
            by
            non-deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in
            includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior
            years in a
            non-U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax
            rate in
            2005 by 1.5 percentage points.

Contingent
            Liabilities

At
            year-end 2006, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain
            legal
            proceedings and related matters. As described under “Litigation and Related
            Contingencies” in Note 11, an unfavorable outcome in the matters described
            therein could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its
            results of operations and cash flows.

Recent
            Accounting Pronouncements

As
            of
            January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R “Share-based Payment.” The
            standard requires that companies record as expense the effect of equity-based
            compensation over the applicable vesting period. The company adopted
            the
            standard using the modified prospective application transition method.
            Under
            this transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning
            January 1, 2006 includes compensation cost for (i) all share-based
            payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006,
            based on
            the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions
            of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent
            to December 31, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
            accordance
            with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized
            ratably over the requisite vesting period or, for 2006 grants, to the
            retirement
            date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Prior period amounts
            have
            not been restated. The company recorded $62 million of pre-tax expense
            in 2006
            for stock options, including $34 million the recognition of which was
            accelerated into 2006 as a result of the merger with Fisher causing a
            change in
            control. The stock option costs of $62 million included $7 million in
            cost of
            revenues, $51 million in selling, general and administrative expenses
            and $4
            million in research and development expenses. As of December 31, 2006,
            the
            company had $133 million ($85 million, net of tax) of total unrecognized
            compensation costs related to unvested equity awards, including unvested
            awards
            at Fisher on the date of merger that converted into awards exercisable
            over
            various vesting periods into shares of company common stock. The cost
            is
            expected to be recognized over approximately 3 years.

In
            September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
            Benefits Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
            Statements
            No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R.” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the
            funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
            plans
            as an asset or liability. The company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December
            31,
            2006. The effect of adoption resulted in increases in total assets of
            $14
            million, total liabilities of $9 million and stockholders’ equity of $5 million.

In
            July
            2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
            in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN No. 48). FIN
            No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize,
            measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
            tax
            positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
            Under
            FIN No. 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax
            consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge
            of the position and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the
            time
            value of money. FIN No. 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces
            a
            prescriptive, annual, tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits.
            FIN
            No. 48 will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company
            does not
            expect the effect of adoption to be material.

In
            September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS
            No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
            value and
            expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
            for
            the company in 2008. The company is currently evaluating the potential
            impact of
            adopting SFAS No. 157.

Discontinued
            Operations

The
            company’s discontinued operations reported after-tax income of $0.5 million in
            2006, representing the results of two small Fisher businesses held for
            sale.

The
            company had after-tax gains of $2 million in 2006 and $25 million in
            2005 from
            the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2006 gains represent additional
            proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a
            charge for
            the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested
            business.

An
            after-tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the
            company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash.
            Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million
            and $1
            million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled
            $27
            million and $1 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale.
            Due to
            the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative
            to
            consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical
            results
            and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition
            to the
            sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8
            million in
            2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from
            the sale
            of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned
            real
            estate and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation
            and an
            arbitration award related to a divested business.

Continuing
            Operations

Sales
            in
            2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427 million (19%) from 2004.
            Sales
            increased $337 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures.
            The
            unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in
            revenues
            of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of
            divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94 million
            (4%)
            primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases,
            as
            described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in
            North
            America and Europe.

Operating
            income was $263 million in 2005, compared with $238 million in 2004.
            Operating
            income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from acquisitions,
            offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income margin
            decreased
            to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $55 million of
            higher
            amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and $10
            million
            of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories
            revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset in part
            by higher
            profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser extent,
            price
            increases.

In
            2005,
            the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million,
            including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily for the
            sale of
            inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred
            $23
            million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities
            and
            relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with
            existing
            businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million, primarily
            from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million,
            principally
            for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company recorded
            restructuring and other costs, net, of $19 million, including charges
            to cost of
            revenues of $3 million, consisting of $2 million for the sale of inventories
            revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1 million of accelerated
            depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations.
            The
            company incurred $17 million of cash costs, primarily for severance,
            abandoned
            facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated.
            In
            addition, the company recorded a gain of $3 million on the sale of a
            product
            line and a loss of $1 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment
            and the
            sale of two abandoned buildings.

Sales
            in
            the Analytical Technologies segment increased $192 million (11%) to $2.007
            billion in 2005. Sales increased $96 million due to acquisitions, net
            of
            divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted
            in a
            decrease in revenues of $4 million in 2005. In addition to the changes
            in
            revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation,
            revenues increased $100 million (6%) due to higher broad-based demand
            from life
            science and industrial customers combined with strong market response
            to new
            products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly
            strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments; and,
            to a
            lesser extent, equipment sold to commodity markets including steel, petroleum
            and cement; instruments used in environmental and security applications;
            and
            anatomical pathology products.

Operating
            income margin was 14.2% in 2005 and 13.1% in 2004. The increase resulted
            from
            profit on incremental revenue, and to a lesser extent, price increases
            and
            productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following
            restructuring actions.

Sales
            in

            to
            $626 million in 2005. Sales increased $241 million due to acquisitions
            (principally Kendro), net of divestitures. Currency translation had an
            immaterial effect on revenues. In addition to the changes in revenue
            resulting
            from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues decreased
            $6
            million (1.5%) due to slightly lower demand for laboratory equipment
            used for
            sample preparation, processing and storage.

Operating
            income margin increased to 13.8% in 2005 from 10.9% in 2004. The increase
            resulted from inclusion of higher margin revenues from Kendro as well
            as
            productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following
            restructuring actions.

Other
            Income, Net

The
            company reported other income, net, of $22 million both in 2005 and 2004
            (Note
            4). Interest income increased to $12 million in 2005 from $9 million
            in 2004,
            primarily due to higher invested cash balances following the sale of
            Spectra-Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent, increased market
            interest
            rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense
            increased to $27 million in 2005 from $11 million in 2004, as a result
            of debt
            used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and, to a lesser extent,
            higher
            rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt.

During
            2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35 million
            and $21
            million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 and $10
            million in
            2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and a loss of $1 million in
            2005 from
            the sale of shares of Newport, in addition to other gains from the company’s
            investment portfolio activity. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes
            net
            currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated
            subsidiaries.

Provision
            for Income Taxes

The
            company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
            The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated
            effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect
            of this
            charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points.
            The
            effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $34 million of
            tax
            benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The company’s federal tax
            returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period
            to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final
            settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously
            unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state
            tax
            returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the company’s
            effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points.

Discontinued
            Operations

The
            company had after-tax gains of $25 million in 2005 and $100 million in
            2004 from
            the disposal of discontinued operations and $43 million of after-tax
            income in
            2004 from discontinued operations.

An
            after-tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the
            company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash.
            Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million
            and $1
            million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled
            $27
            million and $1

million,
            respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. In addition to the sale
            of this
            business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005
            from
            the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale
            of
            businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real
            estate
            and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an
            arbitration award related to a divested business.

In
            July
            2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment,
            Spectra-Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results
            of
            Spectra-Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented
            in the
            accompanying financial statements.

The
            company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the
            date of sale of $119 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued
            operations
            through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision
            of $2
            million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously
            unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and
            tax
            basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a
            tax
            benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million
            in 2004.
            In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics
            of $46
            million, net of a tax provision of $16 million.

The
            tax
            returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses
            were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the
            company
            reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that
            previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses
            totaling $53 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded
            as a gain
            on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004.

In
            addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1 million
            of
            after-tax gains and $1 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued
            operations.

Liquidity
            and Capital Resources

Consolidated
            working capital was $1.507 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with
            $562
            million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to working
            capital
            acquired in the merger with Fisher. Included in working capital were
            cash, cash
            equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $691 million
            at
            December 31, 2006, compared with $295 million at December 31, 2005. The
            increase
            was primarily due to cash acquired in the merger with Fisher.


Cash
            provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including
            $407
            million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities
            used cash of $148 million, primarily as a result of merger-related payments
            made
            following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including
            executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred
            by
            Fisher. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable.
            Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations,
            principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate
            consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006.

In
            connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations,
            the
            company had accrued $20 million for restructuring costs at December 31,
            2006.
            The company expects to pay approximately $7 million of this amount for
            severance
            and retention, primarily through 2007, and $1 million for other costs,
            primarily
            through 2007. The balance of $12 million will be paid for lease obligations
            over
            the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 67% to be paid
            through
            2007 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2006,
            the
            company had accrued $35 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition
            expenses included $30 million of severance and relocation obligations,
            which the
            company expects to pay primarily through 2007. The remaining balance
            primarily
            represents abandoned-facility payments that will be paid over the remaining
            terms of the leases through 2014.

During
            2006, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
            excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions,
            the
            purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines.
            Cash
            acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction
            costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million
            for
            purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated
            assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments
            that
            were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company
            had
            proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities
            of
            the company’s discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006,
            primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004.
            In January
            2007, the company acquired two businesses for an aggregate of $20 million.
            In
            February 2007, Newport repaid in full its note payable to the company,
            totaling
            $48 million.

The
            company’s financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006,
            principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock and
            the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short-term borrowing
            and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short-term
            borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180
            million
            from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits
            from
            the exercise of stock options. In 2006, the company’s Board of Directors
            authorized the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock through
            February 28, 2007. At December 31, 2006, no remaining authorization existed
            for
            future repurchases. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized
            the
            repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s common stock through February
            28, 2008.

The
            company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant
            and
            equipment and expects that for all of 2007, such expenditures will approximate
            $240 - $260 million. On August 29, 2006, the company negotiated a new
            $1 billion
            revolving credit agreement that became effective at the time of the merger
            with
            Fisher and replaced the company’s existing credit facilities. At December 31,
            2006, borrowings of $635 million were available under the revolving credit
            agreement. The company believes that its existing resources, including
            cash and
            investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings
            under
            its existing revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the
            working
            capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future,
            including at least the next 24 months.


Cash
            provided by operating activities was $271 million during 2005, including
            $273
            million provided by continuing operations and $2 million used by discontinued
            operations. Cash of $24 million was provided by an increase in other
            current
            liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing
            of
            payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to
            customers.
            Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on
            gains on
            the sale of investments. The company contributed $11 million of funding
            to a
            U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring actions
            of
            the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and
            other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $20 million
            in 2005.

During
            2005, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
            excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions
            and
            the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended
            $933 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P,
            Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the
            purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the
            sale of
            property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing
            activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash
            in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics
            business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously
            divested
            business in August 2005.

The
            company’s financing activities provided $391 million of cash during 2005,
            principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015
            and a net
            increase in short-term borrowings of $119 million. The company received
            net
            proceeds of $27 million from the exercise of employee stock options during
            2005.

The
            company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan
            with
            cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005,
            the
            company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes
            (the
            Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including
            the
            impact of an interest rate swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the
            company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

Also
            in
            May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company
            an
            uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of
            short-term
            money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market.
            Such
            money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and
            bear
            varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate
            at the time
            of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three
            short-term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of
            one week
            to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the
            borrowings
            under this arrangement.

In
            June
            2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility
            with a bank
            group that provided up to 175 million euros. The facility carried interest
            at a
            Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, the company
            had
            outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124
            million)
            in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average
            interest rate of 2.47%. The facility was terminated in 2006.


Cash
            provided by operating activities was $265 million during 2004, including
            $250
            million provided by continuing operations and $15 million provided by
            discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s
            continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses
            of
            real estate consolidation, used cash of $26 million in 2004. Accounts
            receivable
            increased $34 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry
            and
            informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21 million, due
            in part to
            increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments
            in
            response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued
            operations of $15 million principally represents the positive cash flow
            of
            Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities
            from
            businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and
            lease
            payments on abandoned facilities.

During
            2004, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
            excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions
            for
            $143 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44
            million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions.
            Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $172 million
            of cash in
            2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics to Newport Corporation
            for
            $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result
            of
            Newport assuming non-U.S. debt of Spectra-Physics that had earlier been
            expected
            to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post-closing adjustment
            process, the company refunded $25 million to Newport (Note 16).

The
            company’s financing activities used $183 million of cash during 2004, including
            $184 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company
            expended
            $232 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the company’s common stock. The
            company received net proceeds of $58 million from the exercise of employee
            stock
            options during 2004.

Off-Balance
            Sheet Arrangements

The
            company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet
            financing arrangements in 2004 - 2006 except for letters of credit, bank
            guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table
            below. Of
            the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank
            guarantees,
            surety bonds and other guarantees, $13.7 million relates to guarantees
            of the
            performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses
            that
            were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance,
            primarily in the ordinary course of business.

Amounts
                        represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not
                        include any
                        deferred issuance costs.

(b)

For
                        the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest
                        rates on floating
                        rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December
                        31, 2006,
                        throughout the life of the
                        obligation.

(c)

Unconditional
                        purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods
                        or services that
                        are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all
                        significant
                        terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;
                        fixed,
                        minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate
                        timing of the
                        transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that
                        are cancelable
                        at any time without penalty.

(d)

Obligation
                        represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held
                        by the
                        company.

The
            company holds an investment in a joint venture whereby the current party
            has a
            right to require the company to purchase its interest beginning in 2008.
            The
            purchase price is based on a multiple of pretax earnings.

The
            company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant
            and
            equipment but expects that for 2007, such expenditures for its existing
            business
            will approximate $240 to $260 million.

Table
                  of Contents

In
            disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations,
            warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example,
            unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale
            of real
            estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination
            at
            waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related
            to
            periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability
            to
            estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
            to
            unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that
            these
            uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
            annual results of operations or cash flows.

The
            company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included
            as part of
            environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters
            for a
            discussion of these liabilities.

Item
            7A.

Quantitative

and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
            Risk

The
            company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates

,
            currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future
            results
            of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure
            to these
            risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally,
            the
            company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures
            to
            currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts
            to hedge
            firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than
            its
            subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive
            currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency
            hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related
            to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The
            company’s
            forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated
            in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and
            Swiss
            francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized
            as
            offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being
            hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements.

Interest
            Rates

Certain
            of the company’s short-term available-for-sale investments, long-term notes
            receivable and long-term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest
            rates.
            Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these
            financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest
            rate and
            the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument.
            A 10%
            decrease in year-end 2006 and 2005 market interest rates would result
            in a net
            negative impact to the company of $84 million and $9 million, respectively,
            on
            the net fair value of its interest-sensitive financial instruments.

In
            addition

,
            interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense
            due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in
            90-day
            LIBOR at December 31, 2006 and 2005, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax
            interest expense by $9 million and $1 million, respectively.

Currency
            Exchange Rates

The
            company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional
            currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s
            investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations
            in
            currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s
            international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British
            pounds
            sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange
            rates on
            the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the
“accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10%
            depreciation in year-end 2006 and 2005 functional currencies, relative
            to the
            U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $324 million
            and $66 million, respectively.

                  of Contents

The
            fair
            value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes
            in currency
            exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts
            is the
            estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination
            of the
            contract

,
            taking
            into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation
            in
            year-end 2006 and 2005 currency exchange rates related to the company’s
            contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward
            currency-exchange contracts of $7 million and $1 million, respectively.
            The
            unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting
            from
            changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset
            losses
            or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain
            of the company

’s
            cash
            and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional
            currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange
            rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2006 and 2005 currency
            exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative
            impact
            of $5 million and $3 million, respectively, on the company’s net
            income.

Equity
            Prices

The
            company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities
            that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s
            convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of
            the
            company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the
            fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible
            obligations due to the difference between the current market price and
            the
            market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument.
            The company assumed Fisher’s convertible debt at the date of the merger. A 10%
            increase in year-end 2006 and 2005 market equity prices would reduce
            the fair
            value of the company’s convertible obligations by $128 million and $1 million,
            respectively.

’s
            Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The
            company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive
            officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
            company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
            13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2006. Based on this evaluation,
            the
            company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that,
            as
            of December 31, 2006, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
            effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required
            to be
            disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under
            the
            Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, reported and accumulated
            and
            communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer

            required disclosure.

Management’s
            Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
            company

’s
            management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
            officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal

            and
            15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting
            is a

process
            designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
            financial
            reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
            in
            accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
            company

’s
            management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based
            on
            criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the
            Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
            Based
            on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31,
            2006, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The
            company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers
            LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
            financial reporting and management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
            company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
            as
            stated in their report that appears on pages F-2 and F-3 of this Annual
            Report
            on Form 10-K.

Changes
            in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
            have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting
            (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the
            fiscal
            quarter ended December 31, 2006, that have materially affected or are
            reasonably
            likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial
            reporting. The company acquired Fisher on November 9, 2006 and has evaluated
            Fisher’s internal control over financial reporting as part of its overall
            assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
            2006.

REPORT
                      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
                      FIRM

To
              the
              Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Thermo
            Fisher Scientific Inc.:

We
            have
            completed integrated audits of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s consolidated
            financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
            as of
            December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
            audits,
            are presented below.

Consolidated
            financial statements and financial statement schedule

In
            our
            opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
            under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
            position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
            31,
            2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
            for each
            of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity
            with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
            In
            addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
            the index
            appearing under Item 15(a)(2)

presents
            fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
            read in
            conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
            financial
            statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
            the
            Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
            financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
            We
            conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards
            of the
            Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
            require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
            about
            whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
            audit of
            financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
            the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
            accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
            and
            evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
            our
            audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As
            discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements,
            the Company
            changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation
            in 2006 and
            the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other
            postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

Internal
            control over financial reporting

Also,
            in
            our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Annual Report on
            Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that
            the
            Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
            as of
            December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal
            Control - Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            (COSO),
            is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
            Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
            respects,
            effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
            2006,
            based on criteria established in

Internal
            Control - Integrated Framework

issued
            by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
            internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
            effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
            is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness
            of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
            We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
            accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
            Board
            (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
            audit to
            obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
            over
            financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
            of
            internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
            of
            internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
            testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
            control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary
            in the
            circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
            for our
            opinions.

REPORT
                      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM -
                      (Continued)

A
              company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
              provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
              reporting
              and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
              accordance
              with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
              financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
              to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
              and fairly
              reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
              (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
              necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
              with
              generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
              of
              the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
              management
              and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
              regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
              use, or
              disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
              financial statements.

Because
            of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
            may not
            prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
            of
            effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
            may become
            inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
            with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature
            of Operations

A
            world
            leader in serving science, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company,
            formerly
            Thermo Electron Corporation) enables customers to make the world healthier,
            cleaner and safer. The company offers customers a complete range of high-end
            analytical instruments, software, services, consumables and reagents
            to enable
            integrated laboratory workflow solutions and a complete portfolio of
            laboratory
            equipment, chemicals, supplies and services used in healthcare, scientific
            research, safety and education. Markets served include pharmaceutical
            and
            biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities,
            research institutions and government agencies, as well as environmental
            and
            industrial process control settings.

Principles
            of Consolidation

On
            November 9, 2006, the company completed a merger with Fisher Scientific
            International Inc. Fisher’s accounts and results are included in the
            accompanying financial statements from that date (Note 2). The accompanying
            financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly
            and
            majority-owned subsidiaries. Also, the company consolidates variable
            interest
            entities in which the company bears a majority of the risk to the entities’
potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of entities’ expected
            returns. The company does not currently have any material investments
            in
            entities it consolidates as variable interest entities. All material
            intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company
            accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and
            50%
            using the equity method.

Presentation

In
            July
            2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics, Inc., its optical technologies
            segment.
            The results of operations and cash flows of Spectra-Physics have been
            classified
            as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements (Note
            16).
            Two small business units acquired as part of the merger with Fisher Scientific
            International Inc. (Note 2) are also included in discontinued operations.
            Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform
            to the
            current year presentation.

Revenue
            Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue
            is recognized after all significant obligations have been met

,
            collectibility is probable and title has passed, which typically occurs
            upon
            shipment or delivery or completion of services. If customer-specific
            acceptance
            criteria exists, the company recognizes revenue after demonstrating adherence
            to
            the acceptance criteria. The company recognizes revenue and related costs
            for
            arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation,
            as
            each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value.
            If
            fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for
            all
            elements is deferred until delivery is completed. When a portion of the
            customer’s payment is not due until installation or acceptance, the company
            defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation or
            acceptance has been obtained. Revenues for training are deferred until
            the
            service is completed. Revenues for extended service contracts are recognized
            ratably over the contract period. Provisions for discounts, warranties,
            rebates
            to customers, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period
            the
            related sales are recorded.

The
            company

’s
            informatics businesses recognize revenue from the sale of software. License
            fee
            revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual licenses to end-users
            and are
            recognized when a formal agreement exists, the license fee is fixed and
            determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and collection is
            probable.
            Software arrangements with customers often include multiple elements,
            including
            software products, maintenance and support. The company recognizes software
            license fees based on the residual method after all elements have either
            been
            delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value
            exists for
            such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any
            undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery
            is
            completed. Revenues from

software
            maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis
            over
            the term of the contract, which is generally a period of one year. VSOE
            of fair
            value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the
            price
            charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues
            from
            training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed,
            based
            on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay
            when the
            services are sold separately.

Accounts
            receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
            The
            company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
            resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The
            allowance
            for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable
            credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines
            the
            allowance based on historical write-off experience. Past due balances
            are
            reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged
            off
            against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable
            will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet
            credit
            exposure related to customers.

The
            company records shipping and handling charges billed to customers in
            net sales
            and records shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold for all
            periods
            presented.

Deferred
            revenue in the accompanying balance sheet consists primarily of unearned
            revenue
            on service contracts, which is recognized ratably over the terms of the
            contracts. Substantially all of the deferred revenue in the accompanying
            balance sheet will be recognized within one year.

Warranty
            Obligations

The
            company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties, primarily
            from
            historical information, in cost of revenues at the time product revenue
            is
            recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs
            and
            processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of
            its
            component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
            failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs
            incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts
            delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization
            levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties
            on parts
            differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty
            liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included
            in other
            accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the
            carrying
            amount of warranty obligations are as follows (in thousands):

Income
            Taxes

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the company
            recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences
            of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis
            of assets
            and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the
            year in
            which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax
            return.

Earnings
            per Share

Basic
            earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted
            average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the
            result
            would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings
            per
            share has been computed assuming the conversion of the company’s 3.25%
            Subordinated Convertible Debentures and the elimination of the related
            interest
            expense, and use of the treasury stock method for the remaining convertible
            obligations, warrants and the exercise of stock options, as well as their
            related income tax effects (Note 7).

Cash
            and Cash Equivalents

Cash
            equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper
            and
            other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three
            months
            or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market
            value.

I

nvestments

The
            company’s marketable equity and debt securities that are part of its cash
            management activities are considered short-term investments in the accompanying
            balance sheet. Such securities principally represent available-for-sale
            investments. In addition, the company owns marketable equity securities
            that
            represent less than 20% ownership and for which the company does not
            have the
            ability to exert significant influence. Such investments are also considered
            available-for-sale. All available-for-sale securities are carried at
            market
            value, with the difference between cost and market value, net of related
            tax
            effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive items” component of
            shareholders’ equity

(Notes
            and 9). Decreases in market values of individual securities below cost
            for a
            duration of six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary
            impairment, and the company assesses the need to write down the carrying
            amount
            of the investments to market value through other income, net, in the
            accompanying statement of income.

The
            company has securities held in a rabbi trust for a legacy Fisher supplemental
            nonqualified executive retirement program, as more fully described in
            Note 5 -
            Employee Benefit Plans. These securities had a fair market value of
            approximately $33 million at December 31, 2006. The assets held in the
            rabbi
            trust are comprised of 69% cash and cash equivalents, 16% debt securities
            and
            15% equity securities at December 31, 2006. The debt and equity securities
            are
            classified as available-for-sale. Of the total $33 million of securities
            held as
            of December 31, 2006, $24.4 million is expected to be paid to participants
            in
            2007 and was included in other current assets, while the remainder was
            recorded
            in other assets.

Other
            investments for which there is not a readily determinable market value
            are
            accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically
            evaluates the carrying value of its investment accounted for under the
            cost
            method of accounting, which provides that they are recorded at the lower
            of cost
            or estimated net realizable value. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
            company
            had cost method investments with carrying amounts of $9.6 million and
            $2.5
            million, respectively, which are included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories

—
            Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined
            principally by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method with certain of the
            company’s subsidiaries utilizing the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The
            company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares
            these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In
            addition,
            the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market
            pricing.
            The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a
            lower of
            cost or market analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales
            for the
            amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable
            value. Costs associated with the procurement and warehousing of inventories,
            such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and
            internal
            transfer costs, are included in the cost of revenues line item within
            the
            statement of operations. The components of inventories are as
            follows:

The
            value
            of inventory maintained using the LIFO method was $177.3 million at December
            31,
            2006, which approximated estimated replacement cost as all inventory
            accounted
            for under the LIFO method was acquired in the merger with Fisher and
            was
            recorded at its fair market value on November 9, 2006.

Property

,
            Plant and Equipment

Property,
            plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and
            improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged
            to
            expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization
            using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
            property
            as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and
            equipment,
            3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the
            lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise
            disposed
            of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
            the
            accounts and only resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying
            results of operations. Property, plant and equipment consists of the
            following:

Depreciation
            and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment including amortization
            of assets held under capital leases, was $69.9 million, $45.6 million
            and $43.3
            million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Goodwill

The
            company assesses the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever
            events or
            changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Such events or
            circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or
            a
            significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the
            company

’s
            reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting
            units by
            using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. When an impairment is
            indicated, any excess of carrying value over fair value of goodwill is
            recorded
            as an operating loss.

The
            company completed annual tests for impairment at December 31, 2006 and
            2005, and
            determined that goodwill was not impaired. The company used an income
            approach
            to determine the fair value of its reporting units.

The
            changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as

Asset
            Retirement Obligations

The
            company records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the
            retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement
            costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
            Obligations” and FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional
            Asset Retirement Obligations,” an interpretation of SFAS No. 143 (“FIN 47”). The
            company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
            assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition,
            construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined
            that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation
            is
            conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an
            asset
            retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred,
            if a
            reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the
            liability
            is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional
            carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference
            between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is
            accreted
            over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. The company
            provides
            for asset retirement obligations when such amounts can be reasonably
            estimated,
            regardless of whether the settlement is conditional on a future event.
            At
            December 31, 2006, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations
            of
            $22.9 million.

The
            company, in accordance with FIN 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
            Contracts,” reclassifies net book overdrafts to accounts payable at period end.
            Amounts reclassified to accounts payable totaled $97.2 million at December
            31,
            2006. Bank overdrafts of $3.9 million at December 31, 2006 were reclassified
            to
            short-term debt.

Loss
            Contingencies

Accruals
            are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings,
            environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities,
            self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
            The
            accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the
            probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions
            of
            internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally,
            the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount
            of
            the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities
            acquired
            in the merger with Fisher have been recorded at their fair value and,
            as such,
            were discounted to their present value at the date of acquisition.

Advertising

The
            company expenses advertising costs as incurred, except for certain
            direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized on a
            straight-line basis over its expected period of future benefit, generally
            two
            years. The company has capitalized advertising costs of $14.4 million
            at
            December 31, 2006, included in other assets in the accompanying balance
            sheet.
            Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and
            mailing
            costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed.
            Advertising expense, which following the merger with Fisher includes
            amortization of capitalized direct-response advertising, as described
            above, was
            $57.8 million, $36.0 million and $34.1 million for the years ended December
            31,
            2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in advertising expense was
            catalog
            amortization of $2.0 million for 2006.

            revenues
            and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year in
            accordance
            with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” Resulting translation
            adjustments are reflected in the “Accumulated other comprehensive items”
component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction gains and losses are
            included in the accompanying statement of income and are not material
            for the
            three years presented.

Forward
            Contracts

T

he
            company accounts for forward currency contracts under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
            for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133, as amended,
            requires that all derivatives, including forward currency-exchange contracts,
            be
            recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
            hedges
            are recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,
            depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
            derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the
            hedged item
            through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
            hedged
            item is recognized in earnings. The company immediately records in earnings
            the
            extent to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes
            in fair
            value or cash flows.

Nature
            of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
            (continued)

The
            company uses forward currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain
            operational (cash-flow hedges) and balance sheet (fair-value hedges)
            exposures
            resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result
            from
            purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies
            other
            than the functional currencies of the respective operations. These contracts
            principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British
            pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Swiss francs. The company enters
            into
            these currency-exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases
            and
            sales and assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business,
            principally accounts receivable and intercompany loans. Accordingly,
            the hedges
            are not speculative in nature. As part of the company’s overall strategy to
            manage the level of exposure to the risk of currency-exchange fluctuations,
            some
            operating units hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated
            over the
            ensuing 12-month period, using exchange contracts that have maturities
            of 12
            months or less. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving
            derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.

The
            company records its forward currency-exchange contracts at fair value
            in its
            balance sheet as other current assets or other accrued expenses and,
            for
            cash-flow hedges, the related gains or losses on these contracts are
            deferred as
            a component of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying
            balance
            sheet. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings in
            the period
            in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. Unrealized gains
            and
            losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements
            on
            fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings in the period in which the
            exchange
            rates change and offset the currency losses and gains on the underlying
            exposure
            being hedged. Cash flows resulting from currency-exchange contracts qualifying
            as cash-flow hedges are recorded in the accompanying statement of cash
            flows in
            the same category as the item being hedged. At December 31, 2006, the
            company
            did not have any deferred gains or losses relating to forward currency-exchange
            contracts. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on derivative
            instruments
            is recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying statement of income
            and is
            not material for the three years presented.

The
            company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2005 in connection
            with
            debt issued for the Kendro acquisition (Note 10).

            measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
            tax
            positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
            Under
            FIN No. 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax
            consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge
            of the position and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the
            time
            value of money. FIN No. 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces
            a
            prescriptive, annual, tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits.
            FIN
            No. 48 will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company
            does not
            expect the impact of adoption will be material.

In
            September

2006,
            the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines
            fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
            disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
            for the
            company in 2008. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact
            of
            adopting SFAS No. 157.

Nature
            of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
            (continued)

In
            September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
            Benefits Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
            Statements
            No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R.” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the
            funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
            plans
            as an asset or liability. This amount is defi

ned
            as
            the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
            obligation.
            The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive
            income, net of tax, the actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs
            (credits) that arise but were not previously required to be recognized
            as
            components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income will
            be
            adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components
            of net
            periodic benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 is effective for the company as of
            December
            31, 2006. The incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on individual
            line
            items in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 was as follows

Use
            of Estimates

The
            preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
            accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
            that
            affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
            contingent
            assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
            reported
            amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition,
            significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to quantify
            impairment of assets, and in determining the ultimate loss from abandoning
            leases at facilities being exited (Note 15). Actual results could differ
            from
            those estimates.

Merger,
            Acquisitions and Dispositions

Merger
            with Fisher Scientific International Inc.

Thermo
            Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. (“Fisher”)
            announced on May 8, 2006 that the boards of directors of both companies
            had
            unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine the two companies
            in a
            tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading
            provider
            of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical
            laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services
            to
            customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary
            RNAi
            technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable
            supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. The transaction
            was
            approved by both companies’ shareholders, in separate meetings, held on August
            30, 2006 and, following regulatory approvals, was completed on November
            9, 2006.
            The results of the operations of Fisher have been included in the results
            of the
            company from the date of acquisition. Following the merger, the company
            was
            renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Note

Merger,
            Acquisitions and Dispositions (continued)

Under
            the
            terms of the agreement, Fisher shareholders received two shares of company
            common stock for each share of Fisher common stock they owned. Based
            on the
            average closing price for the two trading days before and after the announcement
            date of $38.93 per share, this exchange represented a value of $77.86
            per Fisher
            share, or an aggregate equity value of $10.3 billion. The company also
            assumed
            Fisher’s debt ($2.3 billion). The merger enabled the two companies to broaden
            their customer offerings to include a full range of analytical instruments,
            equipment, reagents and consumables, software and services for research,
            analysis, discovery and diagnostics.

Upon
            completion of the transaction, Thermo’s shareholders owned approximately 39
            percent of the combined company, and Fisher’s shareholders owned approximately
            61 percent. Based upon pre-merger members of the company’s board of directors
            and senior management representing a majority of the composition of the
            combined
            company’s board and senior management and the Fisher shareholders receiving a
            premium (as of the date preceding the merger announcement) over the fair
            market
            value of Fisher common stock on such date, the company is considered
            to be the
            acquirer for accounting purposes.

The
            purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets, and
            accordingly, $6.44 billion was allocated to goodwill, approximately $450
            million
            of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisitions


On
            December 14, 2006, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired
            Cohesive Technologies Inc., a Massachusetts-based provider of advanced
            sample
            extraction and liquid chromatography products. The purchase price totaled
            $70.2
            million in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment. Cohesive had revenues
            of
            $13.5 million in 2006 through the date of acquisition. The acquisition
            of
            Cohesive enabled the segment to broaden its in-line sample preparation
            capabilities. The company expects to undertake an assessment to determine
            the
            fair value of Cohesive’s identifiable intangible assets in the first quarter of
            2007. Pending completion of that assessment, an estimate of the fair
            value of
            the identifiable intangible assets has been recorded at December 31,
            2006. The
            excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net
            assets or
            $37.0 million, has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
            deductible.

On
            July
            20, 2006, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired GV Instruments
            Limited (GVI), a UK-based provider of isotope ratio mass spectrometry
            instruments and accessories used in earth sciences, medical and life
            sciences
            applications. The acquisition broadened the segment’s offerings of mass
            spectrometry products. The purchase price was $17.5 million, net of cash
            acquired and a post-closing adjustment refund of $4.6 million. This receivable
            from the sellers was accrued at December 31, 2006 and received in January
            2007.
            GVI’s revenues totaled $19 million in its fiscal 2006. The purchase price
            exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly,
            $14.1
            million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Subsequent
            to the acquisition of GVI, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced
            an
            investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for
            consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the
            OFT
            referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further
            investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction
            results in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening
            of
            competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly
            gas
            isotope ratio mass spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers
            and
            multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. Of GVI’s sales in
            its fiscal 2006, $0.4 million were UK sales. The Competition Commission
            must
            prepare and publish its report within 24 weeks of the reference decision
            unless
            there are special reasons why it cannot do so. During the investigation,
            the
            company is subject to certain undertakings, which took effect

            integration of the GVI business with the company or otherwise impair
            the GVI
            business from competing independently. The company is cooperating with
            the
            Competition Commission’s investigation. There can be no assurance as to the
            outcome of this matter. Goodwill and other intangible assets associated
            with the
            acquisition of GVI totaled $22 million at December 31, 2006. Were the
            Competition Commission to require the company to divest of GVI, charges
            for
            impairment of assets could result.

On
            June
            30, 2006, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired EGS Gauging,
            Inc. (EGS), a Massachusetts-based provider of flat polymer web gauging
            products
            for $28.4 million, net of cash acquired, and including contingent consideration
            of $2.0 million based on 2006 revenues and operating results which was
            earned
            and accrued as an obligation at December 31, 2006 through an increase
            to
            goodwill. The acquisition broadened the segment’s gauging systems product
            offerings. EGS’s revenues totaled $25 million in 2005. The purchase price
            exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly,
            $16.1
            million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In
            addition to these acquisitions, the company acquired a small manufacturer
            of
            on-line elemental analyzer products in the third quarter of 2006 as well
            as a
            product line and a small distributor in the second quarter of 2006 for
            aggregate
            consideration of $11.8 million.


In
            August
            2005, the company’s

Analytical
            Technologies

segment
            acquired Ionalytics Corporation, a Canada-based provider of a dynamic
            ion-filtering device used with mass spectrometers in bioanalysis, proteomics
            and
            drug discovery for $24.7 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition
            of
            Ionalytics enabled the segment to broaden its mass spectrometry product
            offerings. Ionalytics did not have material revenues in 2004 as its focus
            was on
            commercially introducing its principal product to market. The purchase
            price
            exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly,
            $6.8
            million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

In
            May
            2005, the company’s Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired the Kendro
            Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation for $837.1 million, net
            of cash
            acquired, including transaction costs. Kendro designs, manufactures,
            markets and
            services, on a global basis, a wide range of laboratory equipment for
            sample
            preparation, processing and storage, used primarily in life sciences
            and drug
            discovery laboratories as well as clinical laboratories. The acquisition
            of
            Kendro broadened the segment’s product offerings and access to customers.
            Kendro’s revenues were $371 million in 2004. The purchase price exceeded the
            fair value of the acquired assets and, accordingly, $453.2 million was
            allocated
            to goodwill, approximately $185 million of which is expected to be tax
            deductible.

The
            company obtained short-term bridge financing, which permitted it to borrow
            $570
            million to partially fund the purchase price of Kendro. The company used
            existing cash balances to fund the remainder of the purchase price.
            Subsequently, the company used a combination of short- and long-term
            debt
            instruments to refinance the bridge loan (Note 10).

In
            April
            2005, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment completed the acquisition of
            Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a New York-based provider of
            continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air,
            emissions
            monitoring and industrial hygiene markets for $31.0 million in cash,
            net of cash
            acquired. The acquisition of R&P enabled the segment to broaden its air
            monitoring product offerings. R&P’s revenues totaled $17 million in 2004.
            The agreement calls for additional consideration of up to $3 million
            through
            2007 based on achieving targeted sales levels and payment of 7% of specified
            product sales thereafter through 2009. The purchase price exceeded the
            fair
            value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $15.5 million was
            allocated
            to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Merger,
            Acquisitions and Dispositions (continued)

In
            March
            2005, the Analytical Technologies segment acquired Niton LLC, a
            Massachusetts-based provider of portable X-ray analyzers to the metals,
            petrochemical and environmental markets for $4

3.0
            million in cash, net of cash acquired and including contingent purchase
            price
            that has been earned. The agreement under which the company acquired
            Niton
            called for contingent consideration of up to $2.0 million through 2006
            based on
            post-acquisition results. Of the total $2.0 million, $1.0 million was
            earned in
            2005 and paid in 2006 and $1.0 million was earned in 2006 and accrued
            at
            December 31, 2006 through an increase to goodwill. The acquisition of
            Niton
            enabled the segment to expand its X-ray products to include a portable
            line.
            Niton’s revenues in 2004 totaled $36 million. The purchase price exceeded the
            fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $17.4 million
            was
            allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.


In
            September 2004, the Analytical Technologies segment broadened its informatics
            offerings by acquiring InnaPhase Corporation, a Pennsylvania-based supplier
            of
            laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and
            biotechnology markets, for $64.7 million, net of cash acquired. In February
            the company received a post-closing adjustment of $0.5 million as a refund
            of
            part of the purchase price. The purchase price exceeded the fair value
            of the
            acquired net assets and, accordingly, $39.8 million was allocated to
            goodwill,
            none of which is tax deductible. InnaPhase had revenues of $17.7 million
            in
            2004, prior to it being acquired.

In
            April
            2004, the

Analytical
            Technologies segment expanded its service capabilities by acquiring US
            Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS), a Wisconsin-based supplier of equipment
            asset
            management services to the pharmaceutical, healthcare and related industries,
            for $74.7 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price exceeded
            the fair
            value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $54.2 million was
            allocated
            to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. USCS reported revenues of
            $57
            million in 2003.

In
            addition, in September 2004, the Analytical Technologies segment acquired
            a
            manufacturer and distributor of air quality instruments in China for
            $3.7
            million in cash.

The
            company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair
            value of the acquired assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations
            of
            synergies of combining the businesses. These synergies include elimination
            of
            duplicative facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing
            infrastructure such as sales force, distribution channels and customer
            relations
            to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the
            infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost effectively expand
            sales of
            company products.

These
            acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
            and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying
            financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Allocation of
            the purchase price for acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair
            value of
            the net assets acquired and, for acquisitions completed in 2006, is subject
            to
            adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The company
            is
            not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price
            allocations
            will differ materially from the preliminary estimates, although for Fisher,
            the
            company expects to complete any outstanding asset valuations in the first
            quarter of 2007 and to finalize its rationalization plans for certain
            product
            lines, headcount and facilities no later than one year from the date
            of
            acquisition.

The
            weighted-average amortization periods for intangible assets with definite
            lives
            are: 14 years for customer relationships, 9 years for product technology
            and 10
            years for tradenames. The weighted-average amortization period for all
            intangible assets with definite lives acquired in the merger with Fisher
            is 13
            years.

The
            company has allocated $15.2 million of the purchase price for Fisher
            to
            in-process research and development, which represents the estimated fair
            value
            at November 9, 2006 related to in-process projects that have not yet
            reached
            technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the
            date of
            the merger. The company has recorded as expense the value attributable
            to these
            projects at the date of the merger.

The
            company uses the income approach to determine the fair values of its
            purchased
            research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating
            the
            after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful
            life
            and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value.
            In
            determining the value of the in-process projects, the company considers,
            among
            other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of
            the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred,
            the
            projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and
            other
            acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful
            life of
            the technology. The company bases the discount rate used to arrive at
            a present
            value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and life
            science
            technology investment risk factors. The company believes that the estimated
            purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the
            fair
            value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third
            party
            would pay for the projects.

The
            weighted-average amortization periods for intangible assets acquired
            in 2004
            are: 5 years for customer relationships and 7 years for product technology.
            The
            weighted-average amortization period for all intangible assets acquired
            in 2004
            is 6 years.

The
            company has undertaken restructuring activities at acquired businesses.
            These
            activities, which were accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No.
            95-3,
“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination,”
have primarily included reductions in staffing levels and the abandonment
            of
            excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring activities,
            as part of
            the cost of acquisitions, the company established reserves as detailed
            below,
            primarily for severance and excess facilities. In accordance with EITF
            Issue No.
            95-3, the company finalizes its restructuring plans no later than one
            year from
            the respective dates of the acquisitions. Upon finalization of restructuring
            plans or settlement of obligations for less than the expected amount,
            any excess
            reserves are reversed with a corresponding decrease in goodwill or other
            intangible assets when no goodwill exists. Accrued acquisition expenses
            are
            included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet.

Note

Merger,
            Acquisitions and Dispositions (continued)

The
            principal acquisition expenses for pre-2005 acquisitions were for severance
            for
            approximately 1,038 employees across all functions and for abandoned
            facilities,
            primarily related to the company’s acquisitions of Life Sciences International
            PLC in 1997, the product-monitoring businesses of Graseby Limited in
            1998,
            Spectra-Physics AB in 1999 and Jouan in 2003. The abandoned facilities
            for the
            1997 and 1998 acquisitions include three operating facilities in England
            with
            leases expiring through 2014. In some instances, the facilities are subleased
            but certain restoration obligations are payable at the end of the lease.
            The
            amounts accrued for abandoned facilities also include closure of a Jouan
            manufacturing facility in Denmark, with a lease expiring in 2007. In
            2004 and
            2005, the company reached favorable settlements of lease obligations
            for several
            abandoned sites and recorded the benefit as a reduction of goodwill.
            The amounts
            captioned as “other” primarily represent employee relocation, contract
            termination and other exit costs.

Dispositions

The
            company sold its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in 2005
            and
            Spectra-Physics in 2004 (Note 16). The company sold non-core businesses
            and
            product lines for net cash proceeds of $8.6 million and $5.7 million
            in 2006 and
            2005, respectively, and recorded $0.6 million and $0.3 million of pre-tax
            gains
            in 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are included in restructuring and
            other
            costs, net, in the accompanying statement of income.

Note
            3.

Business
            Segment and Geographical Information

Following
            the merger with Fisher, the company reorganized management responsibility
            and
            manages the combined company in two segments. Prior year results have
            been
            reclassified to conform to the new segments. The company’s segments are as
            follows:

Analytical
            Technologies: serves research scientists, as well as customers in healthcare
            and
            clinical laboratories, in manufacturing and in the field, with a suite
            of
            advanced analytical technologies, including scientific instruments, robotics
            and
            software for creating advanced integrated workflows. The segment also
            includes a
            range of diagnostic reagents and instruments used by hospitals and reference
            laboratories.

Laboratory
            Products and Services: serves life science, healthcare and safety markets
            with a
            broad portfolio of products and consumables used for routine laboratory
            processes, as well as a range of biopharma outsourcing services such
            as clinical
            packaging and biological sample management. The segment also includes
            the
            company’s extensive customer channels network consisting of catalog, e-commerce
            and other sales avenues.

Business
            segment information captioned as Other in the following tables represents
            results of a unit that marketed and manufactured molecular beam epitaxy
            equipment. The unit was part of the company’s former Optical Technologies
            segment and was sold in 2003. Results after 2003 primarily represent
            revisions
            to estimates of abandoned lease obligations, net of subtenant
            rents.

The
            company’s management evaluates operating segment performance based on operating
            income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated
            with
            acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including
            costs
            arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned
            lease
            expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product
            lines;
            amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for
            acceleration of equity-based compensation following the merger with Fisher.
            The
            company uses this measure because it helps management understand and
            evaluate
            the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance
            for determining compensation.

(b)

The

                      segments. Other
                      income and expense includes $27.6 million and $9.6 million
                      of income in
                      2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily related to the sale
                      of the
                      company’s investments in Thoratec, Newport and FLIR (Note

(c)

Consolidated
                      operating income in 2006 includes stock option compensation expense of
                      $61.9 million ($6.9 million in cost of revenues, $51.3 million
                      in selling,
                      general and administrative expenses and $3.7 million in research

(d)

Had

In
            July
            2004, the company received 3,220,000 shares of Newport Corporation common
            stock
            upon the sale of Spectra-Physics to Newport. In June 2005, the company
            reached
            an agreement with Newport under which Newport purchased all of the 3,220,000
            shares of Newport common stock. Newport purchased the shares for $13.56
            per
            share, which resulted in aggregate proceeds of $43.7 million. The company
            recorded a loss on the sale of $1.3 million. The Newport shares had been
            subject
            to resale restrictions that would have fully lapsed by January
            2006.

As
            a
            result of the divestiture of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001, the company
            acquired shares of Thoratec Corporation. The company sold 4,436,000 and
            1,250,000 shares of Thoratec common stock during 2005 and 2004 and realized
            gains of $28.9 million and $9.6 million, respectively. At December 31,
            2005, the
            company no longer owned shares of Thoratec.

Gain
            on

            that had been classified as Other Assets.

Employee

Stock-based
            Compensation Plans

The
            company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors
            and
            others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based
            awards, including restricted stock, stock options, stock bonus shares
            or
            performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee
            of the
            company’s Board of Directors or in limited circumstances, by the company’s
            option committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. Options
            granted
            prior to July 2000 under these plans vested over 0-10 years and had terms
            ranging from 3-12 years. Options granted in or after July 2000 under
            these plans
            generally vested over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued
            employment with certain exceptions. The company practice is to grant
            options at
            fair market value. The company also has a directors’ stock option plan that
            provides for the annual grant of stock options of the company to outside
            directors. These options generally vest

            years
            after the date of grant.

The
            company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option
            exercises. The merger with Fisher resulted in a change in control and
            consequently, the vesting of substantially all of Thermo Electron’s options
            accelerated except for those of the company’s chief executive officer who waived
            acceleration. As a result, substantially all shares became immediately
            exercisable and shares acquired upon exercise cease to be subject to
            transfer
            restrictions and the company’s repurchase rights. The acceleration resulted in a
            pre-tax charge of $33.8 million, recorded as follows, $3.8 million in
            cost of
            revenues, $27.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses
            and $2.1
            million in research and development expenses. Grants of stock options
            on or
            after November 9, 2006, provide that upon a future change in control
            of the
            company and qualifying termination of an option holder’s employment, all options
            held by the optionee become immediately exercisable unless an employment
            or
            other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment of
            options.

In
            December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123R, “Share-based
            Payment,”

which
            requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including
            employee share options, to be recognized in the financial statements
            based on
            fair value. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as amended,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion
            No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

Effective
            January 1, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using
            the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition
            method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes
            compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted prior to, but
            not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
            estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and
            (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based
            on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
            of SFAS
            No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the requisite
            vesting period or, for 2006 grants, to the retirement date for retirement
            eligible employees, if earlier. Use of the date of retirement eligibility
            to
            record the expense associated with awards granted to retirement eligible
            employees did not materially affect the company’s results of operations in the
            year ended 2006. Prior period amounts have not been restated for the
            adoption of
            SFAS No. 123R.

As
            a
            result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the company’s results for the year
            ended December 31, 2006 include incremental share-based compensation
            pre-tax
            expense of $61.9 million related to stock options, including $33.8 million
            due
            to the acceleration of vesting described above. The total stock-based
            compensation cost of $69.4 million including restricted stock awards, has
            been included in the statements of income within the applicable operating
            expense where the company reports the option holders’ compensation cost. The
            company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based
            compensation expense totaling $23.1 million in the year ended December
            31, 2006.
            The incremental expense, net of the related tax benefit, resulted in
            a $.24
            decrease in basic earnings per share and a $.23 decrease in diluted earnings
            per
            share in 2006. In 2006, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R also resulted in
            the
            inclusion of $17.4 million of excess tax benefits from exercised stock
            options
            in cash flows from financing activities that would have been reflected
            in cash
            flows from operating activities prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS No. 109 and EITF Topic D-32, “Intraperiod
            Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations,”
the company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from
            stock
            option exercises in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental
            income tax
            benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes
            presently
            available to the company. The company measures the tax benefit associated
            with
            excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by
            multiplying
            the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. As of December
            31, 2006,
            there is approximately $42 million of gross net operating losses, the
            tax
            benefit of which will be recorded to additional paid-in capital when
            realized.
            The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization
            of tax
            attributes.

The
            fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes
            option
            pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis
            over
            the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting
            period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain
            assumptions
            with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated
            based
            on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The average expected life
            was estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as
            permitted by SAB 107. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury
            zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected
            life
            assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized for
            all
            equity-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are
            estimated
            based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The
            weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing
            model are
            as follows:

The
            weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted
            during the
            years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $12.40, $9.04 and $8.79, respectively.
            The
            total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was
            $224.3
            million, $20.7 million and $47.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value
            is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise
            date
            and the exercise price of the option.

As
            a
            result of the merger with Fisher, options to purchase 9,661,000 shares
            of Fisher
            common stock were converted into options to purchase 19,322,000 shares
            of
            company stock. These options had a fair value at the merger date of $394.5
            million, which was recorded as part of the merger consideration. Of the
            total
            options issued in connection with the merger, options to purchase 1,621,000
            shares of company common stock were not fully vested. The fair value
            of these
            options ($15.1 million) was treated as a reduction of the merger consideration
            and will be recorded as compensation cost over the vesting period.

As
            of
            December 31, 2006, there was $91.4 million ($58.4 million, net of tax) of total
            unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted
            (including unvested awards converted from outstanding Fisher options).
            The cost
            is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1
            years.

Restricted
            Share Awards

—
The
            company awards to a number of key employees restricted company common
            stock or
            restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of
            common
            stock assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. The awards
            generally
            vest in equal annual installments over two to three years, assuming continued
            employment, with some exceptions. The fair market value of the award
            at the time
            of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients
            of
            restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends,
            whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are
            entitled to
            receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of restricted share/unit
            awards is
            determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market
            value of
            the company’s shares on the grant date. Following the change in control that
            occurred as a result of the Fisher merger, vesting accelerated on outstanding
            restricted stock awards and the company recorded a pretax charge of $2.9
            million
            in 2006.

Employee
            Benefit Plans (continued)

During
            the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the company granted
            401,900,
            146,000 and 60,000 share awards respectively, at a weighted average fair
            value
            of $42.66, $27.91 and $27.99, respectively, per share on the grant
            date.

In
            2006,
            the company awarded certain key employees 134,000 restricted shares of
            common
            stock, the vesting of which is contingent upon meeting certain operating
            targets. The company is recognizing the cost of the awards over the contingent
            vesting period of 4-5 years. The ultimate value of the awards will be
            determined
            when they are earned. The company established an initial value for the
            awards
            based on the fair market value at the date of grant and marks them to
            market for
            changes in fair market value. In 2006, the company recognized $0.2 million
            of
            cost associated with the awards and at December 31, 2006, the awards
            had a value
            of $6.1 million. Should the performance targets not be met, any recognized
            compensation cost would be reversed.

As
            a
            result of the merger with Fisher, restricted units convertible into 468,000
            shares of Fisher common stock were converted into restricted units convertible
            into 936,000 shares of company stock. These restricted units had a fair
            value at
            the merger date of $36.4 million, which was recorded as part of the merger
            consideration. The restricted units issued in connection with the merger
            were
            not fully vested. The fair value of the unvested portion of these units
            ($29.1
            million) was treated as a reduction of the merger consideration and will
            be
            recorded as compensation cost over the vesting period.

A summary
            of the status of the company’s restricted shares/units as of December 31, 2006
            and changes during the year then ended are presented below:

As
            of
            December 31, 2006, there was $41.9 million ($26.1 million, net of tax) of
            total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted share
            awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
            period of
            2.5 years. The total fair value of shares vested during 2006, 2005 and
            2004 was
            $7.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Prior to 2006,
            the
            company recorded the unrecognized compensation cost associated with restricted
            stock awards as a separate account within shareholders equity. Upon the
            adoption
            of SFAS No. 123R in 2006, the balance of the deferred compensation was
            eliminated against capital in excess of par value on the balance
            sheet.

Employee
            Benefit Plans (continued)

Prior
            to
            January 1, 2006, the company accounted for stock-based compensation plans
            in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by
            SFAS No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for
            the issuance of stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater
            than
            the market price at the date of grant. Had compensation cost for awards
            granted
            after 1994 under the company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined
            based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method
            set forth
            under SFAS No. 123, and had the fair value of awards been amortized on
            a
            straight-line basis over the vesting period, the effect on certain financial
            information of the company for 2005 and 2004 would have been as
            follows:

            Benefit Plans (continued)

Employee
            Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying
            employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan
            sponsored by the company. Under this program, through 2005 shares of
            the
            company’s common stock could be purchased at 85% of the lower of the fair market
            value at the beginning or end of the purchase period, and the shares
            purchased
            were subject to a one-year resale restriction. Shares are purchased through
            payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. In
            early 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company issued 59,000, 115,000 and 136,000
            shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2006, 2005 and 2004
            plan
            years, which ended on December 31. Beginning in 2006, shares may be purchased
            under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase
            period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding
            period.

The
            company had a plan in England under which employees could purchase shares
            of the
            company’s common stock through payroll deductions. No material issuances
            occurred in 2004 under the plan. Following the issuance of 30,000 shares
            under
            the plan in 2005, the plan was discontinued.

401(k)
            Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The
            company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority
            of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non U.S. employees. Contributions to
            the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions
            are based on the level of employee contributions.

Certain
            of the company’s subsidiaries offer retirement plans in lieu of participation in
            the company’s 401(k) savings plans. Company contributions to these plans are
            based on formulas determined by the company. For the years ended December
            31,
            2006, 2005 and 2004, the company charged to expense $26.9 million, $22.2
            million
            and $17.7 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution
            plans.

Defined
            Benefit Pension Plans

Employees
            of a number of non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in
            defined
            benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees
            at those
            subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the
            plans and
            applicable laws. Following the merger with Fisher, the company also has
            a cash
            balance pension plan that was amended prior to the merger to eliminate
            future
            compensation credits and a postretirement healthcare program for which
            certain
            employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the healthcare program
            are
            funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.

In
            accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions” (FAS 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
            Pensions” (FAS 106), when an employer is acquired as part of a merger, any
            excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized
            as a
            liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation
            is
            recognized as a plan asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new
            asset
            results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net
            gain or
            loss, (b) unrecognized prior service cost and (c) unrecognized net transition
            obligation. Fisher’s pension obligations were recorded by the company at the
            date of merger pursuant to these rules. The funding of Fisher’s plans is not
            directly affected by the merger.

The
            company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum
            amount as
            actuarially determined. During 2006 and 2005, the company made contributions
            of
            approximately $50.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively. The increase
            in
            contributions from 2005 to 2006 is principally a result of funding benefit
            payments due following the merger with Fisher.

Employee
            Benefit Plans (continued)

Fisher
            also maintained a supplemental nonqualified executive retirement program
            (SERP)
            for certain of its executives. Accrual of future benefits under the plan
            ceased
            following the merger. The benefit obligation related to this program
            is
            approximately $37 million at December 31, 2006. Assets of approximately
            $33
            million at December 31, 2006 are set aside in a rabbi trust established
            for this
            program, of which $24.4 million was included in other current assets,
            while the
            remainder was included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

The
            following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and
            plan assets

Employee
            Benefit Plans (continued)

The
            discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase
            high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle
            its
            current

pension
            obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors,
            including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate
            bonds and
            the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances,
            the
            company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments
            with
            maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately
            estimate
            the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The
            expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average
            rate of
            earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide
            for the
            benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining
            the
            expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers
            the
            relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total
            plan
            assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators
            of future
            performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the
            opinions
            of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return
            benchmarks.

Asset
            management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification
            to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity
            to meet
            immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

The
            expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average
            rate of
            salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience
            and
            management’s expectations of future salary increases.

The
            amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized
            as
            components of net periodic benefit cost in 2007 are as follows

During
            the second quarter of 2005, the company merged two defined benefit plans
            in the
            U.K. and provided the participating employees with a defined contribution
            plan
            while limiting future benefits under the combined defined benefit plan.
            The
            transaction met the criteria of a plan curtailment although no gain or
            loss
            resulted. In connection with the transaction, the company contributed
            $10.9
            million to the combined U.K. defined benefit plan.

Contributions,
            consisting primarily of voluntary contributions to the company’s plans, are
            estimated at between $20 million and $30 million for 2007.

Expected
            benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining
            the company’s benefit obligation at December 31, 2006. Benefit payments will
            depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed
            and
            average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these
            factors
            could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated
            future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate
            for the
            five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows (in thousands):

The
            company’s investment policy for its pension plans is to balance risk and return
            through a diversified portfolio to reduce interest rate and market risk.
            Maturities are managed so that sufficient liquidity exists to meet immediate
            and
            future benefit payment requirements.

Income
            Taxes (continued)

During
            2004 and early 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the company
            reached
            a final settlement of the audit of the company’s tax returns for the 1998
            through 2000 tax years. In addition, in 2004, audits of state tax returns
            were
            completed. In 2004, the company recorded tax benefits that had not previously
            been recognized of $33.8 million in continuing operations and $52.7 million
            in
            discontinued operations (Note 16) associated with the completion of the
            tax
            audits.

In
            addition to the tax benefit of $52.7 million, discussed above, the company’s tax
            benefit from discontinued operations in 2004 included amounts pertaining
            to
            Spectra-Physics (Note 16).

At
            December 31, 2006, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating
            loss carryforwards of $347.4 million, $617.6 million and $455.8 million,
            respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future
            income of
            certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
            expire in the years 2007 through 2026. Of the non-U.S. net operating
            loss
            carryforwards, $48.7 million expire in the years 2007 through 2026, and
            the
            remainder do not expire. The company also had $65.2 million of federal
            foreign
            tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2006, which expire in the
            years 2007
            through 2016.

A
            provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on
            $

1.50
            billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that
            could be
            subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans
            to keep
            these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where
            the
            company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net
            tax
            cost.

            to purchase 3,783,000, 1,391,000 and 1,078,000 shares of common stock
            were not
            included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2006, 2005
            and
            2004, respectively, because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the
            average market price for the common stock and their effect would have
            been
            antidilutive.

Under
            Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 04-08 “The Effect of Contingently
            Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” and EITF No. 90- 19
“Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon Conversion,”
because of the company’s obligation to settle the par value of its convertible
            notes in cash, the company is not required to include any shares underlying
            the
            convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding
            until the
            average stock price per share for the period exceeds the $23.73, $29.55,
            and
            $40.20 conversion price for the 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023,
            the
            Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 and the 3.25% Senior
            Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024, respectively, and only to the
            extent of
            the additional shares the company may be required to issue in the event
            the
            company’s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the notes or
            debentures converted. At such time, only the number of shares that would
            be
            issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution)
            are
            included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price
            exceeds the conversion price.

The
            table
            below discloses the effect of increases in the company’s stock price on the
            amount of shares to be included in the earnings per share calculation.
            The
            trigger price is the common stock price at which the securities become
            convertible. The table assumes normal conversion for the 2.50% Senior
            Convertible Notes due 2023, the Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures
            due
            2033 and the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 in
            which the

The
            cost
            basis for equity securities acquired as part of the Fisher merger is the fair
            market value of the securities on the date of the merger.

The
            cost
            of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific
            identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the
            accompanying statement of income. The net gain on the sale of available-for-sale
            investments resulted from gross realized gains of $0.7 million, $35.1
            million
            and $21.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and gross realized
            losses of $1.3 million and $0.2 million in 2005 and 2004,
            respectively.

The
            company’s investments in auction rate securities are recorded at cost, which
            approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates. The interest
            rates
            generally reset every 7 to 28 days. Despite the long-term nature of their
            stated
            contractual maturities, all of which are over 10 years, the company has
            the
            ability to quickly liquidate investments in auction rate securities.
            All income
            generated from these investments has been recorded as interest
            income.

In
            addition to available-for-sale investments, the company had $3.5 million
            of
            trading securities at December 31, 2006, consisting of debt and equity
            securities. Trading gains and losses associated with this portfolio were
            not
            material in 2006.

Short-term
            obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying
            balance sheet included $467.3 million and $128.5 million at year-end
            2006 and
            2005, respectively, of short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under
            lines of
            credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The borrowings outstanding at
            year-end 2005 include amounts under the company’s euro facility, described
            below, which terminated in November 2006. The weighted average interest
            rate for
            short-term borrowings was 5.6% and 2.4% at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s five-year
            revolving credit agreements and a money market loan fund arrangement,
            all
            discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $227.8 million
            as of
            December 31, 2006. These unused lines of credit generally provide for
            short-term
            unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.

Debt
            and Other Financing Arrangements (continued)

On
            November 9, 2006, in connection with the merger with Fisher, the company
            entered
            into a new $1 billion multi-currency credit facility, discussed below.
            The
            company used proceeds from this facility to prepay Fisher debt. The company
            also
            terminated its $250 million revolving credit and 175 million euro credit
            facilities. There were no outstanding balances when those facilities
            were
            terminated.

In
            connection with the Fisher merger, the company assumed three issuances
            of
            convertible debt as well as two issuances of fixed-rate debt, described
            below.
            The company became a co-obligor of this debt. The debt was recorded at
            the
            merger date at its fair value. The excess of the fair value over the
            principal
            value of the convertible debt, or $546.8 million, was deemed to arise
            from the
            value of the conversion features and was allocated to additional paid-in
            capital.

On
            December 15, 2006, the company provided a notice to the holders of the
            3.25%
            subordinated convertible

debentures

due 2007
            that the debentures would be redeemed on January 5, 2007. The holders’ right to
            convert the debentures into common shares of the company expired on December
            28,
            2006. The holders of $69.8 million in aggregate principal amount converted
            their
            debentures into common shares. On January 5, 2007, the remaining debentures
            totaling $7.4 million in aggregate principal amount were redeemed at
            par plus
            accrued interest.

During
            2005, the company completed the following significant transactions:

·

In
                      May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal
                      amount of 5%
                      Senior Notes due 2015. The proceeds of the notes were used,
                      in part, to
                      finance the Kendro acquisition.

·

In
                      May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides
                      an
                      uncommitted

line
                      of credit of up

to
                      $250 million

through
                      a series of short-term money market loans funded on an ongoing
                      basis in
                      the secondary market.

·

In
                      June 2005, the company entered into a five year 175 million
                      euro revolving
                      credit facility. The facility was terminated on November 9,
                      2006.

·

The
                      company repaid $570 million of bridge loan financing with cash
                      and new
                      debt described above.

Credit
            Facilities

In
            November 2006, the company entered into a revolving credit facility (the
            “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a bank group that provides for up to $1
            billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit that will expire
            in August
            2011. The agreement allows for the company to request a one year extension
            of
            the facility at the end of the first and second years. The company also
            has the
            right to request an increase in the size of the facility by up to $500
            million.
            The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate
            based on
            the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The rate at
            December 31, 2006, was 5.63% under the more favorable of the two rates.
            The
            Revolving Credit Facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit,
            which
            reduces the amount available for borrowing. The agreement contains affirmative,
            negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for
            financings
            of this type. The financial covenant requires the company to maintain
            total
            leverage below a certain maximum level. The credit agreement permits
            the company
            to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of
            common
            stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and
            general
            corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2006, there were $322 million
            of
            borrowings under the revolver and $42.9 million in letters of credit
            outstanding, resulting in $635.1 million of borrowings available under
            the
            Revolving Credit Facility.

            events at

            a
            co-obligation in respect of payment of interest and principal of the
            notes and
            amended the conversion feature such that the notes are convertible into

upon
            conversion, up to the principal amount of notes converted. The company
            will have
            the option to satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of
            the
            principal amount in cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may
            be
            redeemed, in whole or in part, at the company’s option, on or after March 2,
            2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition,
            holders of the notes have the option, subject to certain conditions,
            to require
            us to purchase any notes held by them for 100% of the principal amount
            plus
            accrued interest on March 1, 2011, March 1, 2016 and March 1, 2021, or
            upon a
            change of control.

3.25%

Subordinated
            Convertible Debentures, Due 2007

At
            December 31, 2006, the company had $7.4 million aggregate principal amount
            of
            3.25% Subordinated Convertible

Debentures

due
            2007. Interest on the notes was payable on May 1 and November 1 of each
            year.
            The notes had been convertible at the option of the holder upon the occurrence
            of certain events at a price of $41.84 per share. In December 2006, the
            company
            provided notice to the holders that the debentures would be redeemed
            on January
            5, 2007. The holders’ right to convert the debentures into common shares of the
            company expired on December 28, 2006. The holders of $69.8 million in
            principal
            converted their debentures into 1,668,000 shares. On January 5, 2007,
            the
            remaining debentures totaling $7.4 million in aggregate principal amount
            were
            redeemed at par plus accrued interest.

5%
            Senior Notes due 2015

The
            company has $250 million principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2015.
            Interest
            on the notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The notes
            may be
            redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount
            plus
            a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is
            subject to
            certain affirmative and negative covenants.

Prior
            to
            issuing this debt,

the
            company entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with
            several
            banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion
            of a
            debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was
            probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments
            over a
            10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual
            fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the
            10-year
            fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The
            change
            in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net
            of tax,
            and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
            items
            within shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the
            term of the debt through 2015.

            5/8% Senior Notes due 2008

The
            company has $128.7 million principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due
            2008.
            Interest on the notes is payable on April 30 and October 30 of each year.
            The
            notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the
            principal
            amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The
            company is
            subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

During
            2002, the company entered into interest-rate swap arrangements for the
            $128.7
            million of notes with the objective of reducing interest costs. The arrangements
            provide that the company will receive a fixed interest rate of 7 5/8%,
            and will
            pay a variable rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 2.19% (7.55% as of December
            31, 2006).
            The swaps have terms expiring at the maturity of the debt. The swaps
            are
            designated as fair-value hedges and as such, are carried at fair value,
            which
            resulted in an increase in both other long-term assets and long-term
            debt of
            $0.6 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
            The
            swap arrangements are with different counterparties than the holders
            of the
            underlying debt. Management believes that any credit risk associated
            with the
            swaps is remote based on the creditworthiness of the financial institutions
            issuing the swaps.

            3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014

At
            the
            closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $300 million
            principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest
            on the
            notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes
            may be
            redeemed, in whole or in part, at the company’s option, on or after August 15,
            2009, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. At any period
            prior
            to August 15, 2009, the company may redeem the notes at a redemption
            price of
            100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus
            accrued
            interest. Also, on or prior to August 15, 2007, the company, at its option,
            may
            redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a
            redemption
            price equal to 106.75% of the principal amount plus accrued interest
            with the
            proceeds of one or more equity offerings. If a change of control occurs
            and the
            notes fail to maintain at least a BBB- rating by S&P and a Baa3 rating by
            Moody’s, each holder of notes may require the company to repurchase some or
            all
            of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
            plus
            accrued interest.

            1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015

At
            the
            closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $500 million
            principal amount of 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015. Interest
            on the
            notes is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The notes may
            be
            redeemed, in whole or in part, at the company’s option, on or after July 1,

            prior
            to July 1, 2010, the company may redeem the notes at a redemption price
            of 100%
            of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued
            interest. Also, on or prior to July 1, 2008, the company, at its option,
            may
            redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a

Purchase
            Obligations

The
            company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary
            course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods or services
            that
            are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant
            terms
            including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum
            or
            variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
            Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time
            without
            penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase
            obligations totaled $119.0 million at December 31, 2006 and the full
            amount of
            these obligations is expected to be settled during 2007.

Letters
            of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding
            letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $76.6 million at December
            31,
            2006, including $4.7 million for businesses that have been sold. The
            expiration
            of these credits and guarantees ranges through 2013.

Outstanding
            surety bonds and other guaranties totaled $37.2 million at December 31,
            2006.
            The expiration of these bonds and guaranties ranges through 2012.

The
            letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure
            performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the
            face
            amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the
            applicable
            business unit does not perform as contractually required. With respect
            to
            letters of credit, guarantees and surety bonds that were issued for businesses
            that were sold, the buyer is obligated to indemnify the company in the
            event
            such letters of credit and/or surety bonds are drawn.

In
            connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have
            assumed
            certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to
            indemnify
            the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a
            third
            party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations
            or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract,
            the
            company could be liable to the third party for such obligations. However,
            in
            such event, the company would be entitled to indemnification by the
            buyer.

The
            company has funding commitments totaling $15.4 million at December 31,
            2006,
            related to investments it owns.

Indemnifications

In
            conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company
            has
            agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities
            related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were
            abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and
            product
            liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary
            from
            transaction to transaction. Where appropriate, an obligation for such
            indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation
            cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities
            at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant
            payments for these indemnifications.

In
            connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it
            occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet
            them
            to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third party,
            it
            remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the
            owner of
            the facility. As a result, if a third party vacates the sublet facility,
            the
            company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the
            master
            lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default
            by
            sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s
            financial position or results of operations.

Commitments
            and Contingencies (continued)

In
            connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business,
            the
            company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that
            its
            products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others
            and
            agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
            The company has not been required to make material payments under such
            provisions.

Litigation
            and Related Contingencies

On
            September 3, 2004, Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS
            Scientific Instruments filed a lawsuit against the company in U.S. federal
            court. These plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems,
            including its triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems,
            infringe a
            patent of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek damages, including treble
            damages
            for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and
            injunctive relief. In the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome
            of this
            matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position
            as well as its results of operations and cash flows.

On
            December 8, 2004 and February 23, 2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits
            against a combination of Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied
            Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments that one or more of these parties
            infringe
            two patents of the company.

There
            are
            various other lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving
            contract, product liability and other issues. In view of the company’s financial
            condition and the accruals established for related matters, management
            does not
            believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters
            will have
            a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition

,
            results
            of operations or cash flows.

The
            company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed
            to pay
            damages in the future for insured events that have already occurred.
            The accrued
            liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses,
            opinions of legal counsel and, where applicable, actuarially determined
            estimates. The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information
            becomes
            known or payments are made.

When
            a
            range of probable loss can be estimated the company accrues the most
            likely
            amount, or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss. The range
            of
            probable loss for matters at Fisher related to workers compensation,
            general,
            automobile and product liabilities at December 31, 2006, was approximately
            $128
            million to $252 million on an undiscounted basis. Having assumed these
            liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount
            the
            estimate of loss to fair (present) value, $83 million at December 31,
            2006. This
            reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts
            due
            from insurers of $39 million at December 31, 2006, also recorded at their
            fair
            value at the date of merger. The assets and liabilities assumed at the
            acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value
            of
            expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk
            free
            rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted
            average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of
            approximately $48 million and the discount on the assets of approximately
            $28
            million (net discount $20 million) will be accreted to interest expense
            over the
            expected settlement period which is estimated to be between 10 and 20
            years. In
            addition to the reserves recorded due to the merger with Fisher, as of
            December
            31, 2006, the company had product liability reserves of $23 million
            (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. The process of estimating
            losses
            involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate
            amount
            of expense could vary. However, the company believes that the amounts
            reserved
            are adequate based on available information.

In
            the
            ordinary course of business, the company has purchased insurance coverage
            from
            third-party insurance carriers to minimize loss and manage risk from
            certain
            worker injury, general, automobile and product liability. Insurance contracts
            do
            not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any
            losses

incurred.
            The collectibility of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the
            solvency
            and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency
            of the
            insurance claims. Management monitors the financial condition and ratings
            of its
            insurers on an ongoing basis.

The
            company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and
            remediation
            related to environmental matters, principally at businesses acquired
            in the
            merger with Fisher. The company cannot predict all potential costs related
            to
            environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations
            given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup,
            the
            complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the
            varying
            costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s
            responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters relate
            to the
            costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining
            groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to
            historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and
            international facilities were not material in any period presented. The
            company’s liability for environmental matters associated with businesses
            acquired in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair value and
            as such,
            was discounted to its present value. The company records accruals for
            environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations
            of
            environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability
            has
            been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
            The
            company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports
            prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and
            experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in
            these
            estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation
            and
            maintenance of cleanup sites. Having assumed these environmental liabilities
            in
            the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate
            of
            loss to fair (present) value, $23.2 million. This fair value was ascribed
            by
            using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate
            for
            monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental
            liability. The discount of $10.0 million will be accreted by charges
            to interest
            expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years. At December 31,
            2006,
            the environmental liability was approximately $24 million. Accrued liabilities
            for environmental matters were not material prior to 2006.

Management
            believes that this accrual is adequate for the environmental remediation
            costs
            the company expects to incur. As a result, the company believes that
            the
            ultimate liability with respect to environmental remediation matters
            will not
            have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of
            operations or cash flows. However, the company may be subject to additional
            remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in
            existing
            laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies,
            developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of
            the
            company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the
            company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although
            these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party
            recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against
            third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.

            power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the
            Acquiring
            Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the
            number of
            shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise
            price
            of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such

At

            whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash
            or stock).
            The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or
            exchanged.

The
            fair
            value of the notes receivable (principally the note receivable from Newport)
            was
            determined based on borrowing rates available to companies of comparable
            credit
            worthiness at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In February 2007, the company
            received
            full payment of the note receivable from Newport.

The
            fair
            value of long-term obligations was determined based on quoted market
            prices and
            on borrowing rates available to the company at the respective year ends.

The
            notional amounts of forward currency-exchange contracts outstanding totaled
            $72.2 million and $94.8 million at year-end 2006 and 2005, respectively.
            The
            fair value of such contracts is the estimated amount that the company
            would
            receive upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change
            in
            currency exchange rates.

Restructuring
            and Other Costs, Net

In
            response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection
            with
            the company’s overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in
            2003, and to a lesser extent, 2004 in a number of business units to reduce
            costs
            and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation
            of
            facilities. Restructuring and other costs recorded in 2005 were primarily
            for
            reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the
            integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities in Texas.
            The 2005
            costs also include charges associated with actions initiated prior to
            2005 that
            could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided
            reserves due to changes in estimates of sub-tenant rentals from abandoned
            facilities. The restructuring actions undertaken in 2003 and 2004 were
            substantially complete at the end of 2004. Restructuring costs in 2006
            include
            charges to close a plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations
            with
            those of an acquired Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for
            consolidation of a U.K. facility into an existing factory in Germany,
            the move
            of manufacturing operations in New Mexico to other plants in the U.S.
            and Europe
            and remaining costs of prior actions. The company is finalizing its plan
            for
            potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at Fisher or within
            existing businesses with which Fisher is being integrated. Such actions
            may
            include rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities
            and
            reductions in staffing levels. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses
            is being
            charged to the cost of the acquisition while the cost of actions at existing
            businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to expense. The company
            has
            identified actions at existing businesses totaling $5 million that will
            be
            undertaken in 2007 and expects to identify additional actions as it completes
            its plans for integrating Fisher. The company expects to finalize its
            restructuring plans related to the Fisher merger no later than one year
            from the
            date of merger. The company has finalized its plans for integrating Kendro
            with
            its existing business and expects that charges to expense will ultimately
            total
            $16 million, of which approximately $15 million has been recorded as
            of December
            31, 2006 with the balance to be recorded as incurred.

            million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of
            acquisition, and $30 million of other costs, net. These other costs consisted
            of
            $16 million of

cash
            costs, principally associated with the consolidation of a U.K. facility
            into an
            existing factory in Germany and the move of manufacturing operations
            in New
            Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe, including

$9

million
            of severance for 209 employees across all functions

;
            $5
            million of abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges associated
            with
            facilities vacated in prior periods where estimates have changed; and
            $2 million
            of other cash costs, primarily relocation expenses associated with facility
            consolidations. These severance and other cash costs were net of reversals
            of $1
            million, principally due to lower costs resulting from employee attrition.
            In
            addition, the segment recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process
            research
            and development at Fisher on the merger date. The segment also recorded
            a net
            gain of $1 million on the sale of two product lines.

Laboratory
            Products and Services

The
            Laboratory Products and Services segment recorded $42 million of net
            restructuring and other charges in 2006. The segment recorded charges
            to cost of
            revenues of $35 million, consisting of $3 million for accelerated depreciation
            at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation and $32 million
            for the
            sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and $7 million
            of other
            costs, net. These other costs consisted of $6 million of cash costs,
            principally
            associated with close of a plant in Massachusetts and the consolidation
            of its
            operations with those of an existing factory, including $3 million of
            severance
            for 123 employees across all functions; $2 million of abandoned-facility
            costs;
            and $1 million of other cash costs, primarily retention and relocation
            expenses.
            These severance, facility and other cash costs were net of reversals
            of $1
            million, principally due to lower costs resulting from employee attrition.
            In
            addition, the segment recorded a net charge of $1 million for the writedown
            to
            estimated disposal value and the sale of abandoned assets.

            These
            cash costs were primarily for pre-merger integration expenses and retention
            agreements with certain Fisher employees. Retention costs are accrued
            ratably
            over the period the employees must work to qualify for the payment.

              follows:

Analytical
              Technologies

The
            Analytical Technologies segment recorded $11 million of net restructuring
            and
            other charges in 2005. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues
            of $1.2
            million, consisting of $0.7 million for the sale of inventories revalued
            at the
            date of acquisition and $0.5 million for accelerated depreciation at
            facilities
            closing due to real estate consolidation; and $10 million of other costs,
            net.
            These other costs consisted of $13 million of cash costs, including $6
            million
            of severance for 174 employees across all functions; $6 million of
            abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges associated with facilities
            vacated in prior periods where estimates of sub-tenant rental income
            have
            changed or for costs that could not be recorded until incurred and for
            the 2005
            consolidation of two operating facilities in Texas; and $1 million of
            other cash
            costs, primarily retention and relocation expenses associated with facility
            consolidations. These severance and other cash costs were net of reversals
            of $1
            million, principally due to lower costs resulting from employee attrition.
            These
            costs were offset by gains of $3 million from the sale of four abandoned
            buildings.

Laboratory
            Products and Services

The
            Laboratory Products and Services segment recorded $17 million of net
            restructuring and other charges in 2005. The segment recorded charges
            to cost of
            revenues of $12 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date
            of
            acquisition; and $5 million of other costs, net. These other costs consisted
            of
            $8 million of cash costs, principally associated with the integration
            of Kendro
            with existing businesses, including $7 million of severance for 75 employees
            across all functions; and $1 million of other cash costs, primarily retention
            and relocation expenses. In addition, the segment recorded charges of
            $2 million
            primarily for the writedown to estimated disposal value of a building
            in France
            held for sale. These costs were offset by gains of $5 million from the
            sale of
            two abandoned buildings.

Other

The
            company reversed previously established reserves of $1 million in 2005
            as a
            result of revising its estimate of lease obligations due to sub-leasing
            an
            abandoned facility of a divested business.

;

$4

million
            of abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges associated with facilities

            changed or for costs that could not be recorded until incurred; and

$1

million
            of other cash costs, primarily

relocation
            expenses. These severance and other cash costs were net of reversals
            of

$1

million,
            principally due to lower costs resulting from employee attrition. In
            addition,

The
            company recorded $2 million of restructuring and other charges at its
            U.S. and
            European administrative offices in 2004, all of which were cash costs.
            These
            cash costs included $1 million of severance and $1 million of third-party
            advisory fees. While the company no longer has any public subsidiaries,
            it has
            numerous non-U.S. subsidiaries through which the formerly public subsidiaries
            conducted business. The third-party advisory fees were incurred to simplify
            this
            legal structure. The principal aspects of this project were completed
            in
            2004.

The
            following table summarizes the cash components of the company’s restructuring
            plans. The noncash components and other amounts reported as restructuring
            and

(a)

Employee-retention
                      costs are accrued ratably over the period through which employees
                      must
                      work to qualify for a payment. The pre-2002 awards were based
                      on specified
                      percentages of employees’ salaries and were generally awarded to help
                      ensure continued employment at least through completion of
                      the company’s
                      reorganization plan.

Represents
                      reductions in cost of plans as described in the discussion
                      of
                      restructuring actions by segment.

(c)

Excludes
                      noncash charges, net, of $1.2 million and other income, net,
                      of $2.7
                      million.

(d)

Excludes
            net gains of $7.8 million from the sale of six abandoned buildings, noncash
            charges of $1.7 million and a gain of $0.3 million from the sale of a
            small
            non-core business.

(e)

Excludes
            noncash charges, net, of $17.4 million and net gains from the sale of
            abandoned
            assets of $1.9 million.

The
            company expects to pay accrued restructuring costs as follows: severance,
            employee-retention obligations and other costs, which principally consist
            of
            cancellation/termination fees, primarily through 2007; and abandoned-facility
            payments, over lease terms expiring through 2013.

Note
            16.

Discontinued
            Operations

During
            2006, the company committed to a plan to dispose of Genevac Limited (Genevac),
            a
            Fisher business which is a manufacturer of solvent evaporation technology.
            The
            decision follows the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) consent order
            which
            requires divesture of Genevac for FTC approval of the Thermo Fisher merger
            under
            the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The results of discontinued
            operations also include the results of Systems Manufacturing Corporation,
            a
            Fisher business which provides consoles, workstations and server enclosures
            for
            information technology operations and data centers. The assets and liabilities
            of these entities were not material at December 31, 2006. For the period
            from
            November 9, 2006 through December 31, 2006, these entities had net income
            of
            $0.5 million which is classified as income from discontinued operations
            in the
            accompanying statements of operations.

The
            Company had $2.1 million of gains from the disposal of discontinued operations
            in 2006, including primarily additional proceeds from the sale of several
            businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for settlement of an indemnification
            claim that arose from a divested business.

In
            2005,
            the company recorded after-tax gains of $24.9 million from the disposal
            of
            discontinued operations. In September 2005, the Analytical Technologies
            segment
            sold its point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million
            in cash
            after determining it was not a strategic fit in the long-term. The company
            recorded an after-tax gain of $16.8 million as a result of the sale.
            Revenues
            and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $29.7 million and $0.7
            million, respectively, in 2004

and
            revenues and pre-tax income totaled $26.6 million and $1.0 million,
            respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality
            of the
            operating results of this business relative to consolidated results,
            the company
            has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business
            to
            discontinued operations. In August 2005, the company sold a building
            of a
            previously divested business for net proceeds of $7.3 million in cash,
            which
            approximated its carrying value. In addition, the company recorded after-tax
            gains of $8.1 million from the disposal of discontinued operations. The
            gains
            represent additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior
            to
            2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments,
            settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to divested
            businesses.

During
            2004, the company’s discontinued operations (principally Spectra-Physics) had
            revenues and net income of $118.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
            In
            addition, the company recorded a $38.5 million tax benefit related to
            Spectra-Physics, described below. During 2003, the company’s discontinued
            operations had revenues and a net loss of $197.8 million and $2.5 million,
            respectively. Liabilities of discontinued operations principally represent
            remaining obligations of the discontinued businesses including litigation,
            severance and lease obligations.

Spectra-Physics

In
            July
            2004, the company sold its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra-Physics,
            to
            Newport for initial consideration of $300 million, subject to a post-closing
            balance sheet adjustment. As a result of Newport assuming non-U.S. debt
            of
            Spectra-Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the
            company and
            as a result of the post-closing adjustment process, the company paid
            $25.1
            million to Newport, making the net selling price approximately $275 million.
            The
            company sold this operating unit to focus on its core businesses that
            provide
            analytical instrumentation to laboratory and industrial customers. The
            net
            selling price of $275 million exceeded Spectra-Physics’ book value and was
            comprised of $175 million in cash; a 5% note in the principal amount
            of $50
            million, due in 2009; and $50 million in Newport common stock, with the
            number
            of issued shares determined based on the 20-trading day average price
            prior to
            closing. The fair value of the note and Newport common stock at the date
            of
            closing aggregated approximately $90 million. The note receivable from
            Newport
            is classified as noncurrent other assets in the accompanying balance
            sheet. In
            February 2007, Newport repaid the note in full. Under the terms of the
            agreement, the company had agreed to certain restrictions on the sale
            of the
            Newport shares it received in this transaction, however, this restriction
            was
            subsequently removed and as of December 31, 2005, the company no longer
            owned
            shares of Newport common stock. The company retained a small manufacturing
            unit
            in New York.

As
            a
            result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized
            tax
            asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of
            Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit
            as
            income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In
            addition,
            the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics of $45.9 million,
            net
            of a tax provision of $15.9 million.

Other

In
            January 2000, the company announced its intention to sell several of
            its
            businesses, including its power-generation business and its Trex Medical
            and
            ThermoLase units. The company classified these businesses as discontinued
            operations.

The
            tax
            returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses
            were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the
            company
            reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that
            previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses
            totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded
            as a
            gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2004.

In
            addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million
            of
            after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued
            operations.
