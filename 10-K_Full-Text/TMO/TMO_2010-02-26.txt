Environmental
Matters

We are subject to various laws and
governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety
and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal
environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to
regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to
promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal
activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the
aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters
under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental
and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar
to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the
handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be
classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable
laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our
operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses.

Our expenses for environmental
requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical
remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these
compliance costs are not material. For

historical
remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of
permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment
systems and other remedial measures.

orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984.
Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action program administered by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency. We are required to maintain
groundwater-remediation activities at these sites. As the owner of the Fair Lawn
facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation
within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.

We record accruals for environmental
liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates
based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental
specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental
matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation,
remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities
for environmental matters totaled $23 million at December 31, 2009. The
liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the
date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present
value.

These environmental liabilities do not
include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our
accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to
incur. As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to
environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to
additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in
existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement
policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of
our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Regulatory
Affairs

Our operations, and some of the
products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and
regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution
of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and
security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug
Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state
and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and
import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the
U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our
logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the
Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar
foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects
with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial
fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution
services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date,
none has had a material impact on our operations.

We are subject to laws and
regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws
and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have
agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a
result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to
investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government
contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension
of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or
debarment.

Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that
we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking
statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and
limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.

We must develop new products, adapt
to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of
new products in order to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes
significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our
products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant
technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and
enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of
new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely
become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and
operating results would suffer.

It may be difficult for us to
implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the
markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several
years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve
our internal growth, including:

•

finding
      new markets for our products;

•

developing
      new applications for our
technologies;

•

combining
      sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more
      effectively;

•

allocating
      research and development funding to products with higher growth
      prospects;

•

continuing
      key customer initiatives;

(continued)

•

expanding
      our service offerings;

•

strengthening
      our presence in selected geographic markets;
and

•

continuing
      the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and
      support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take
      advantage of our breadth in product
offerings.

We may not be able to successfully
implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of
our business.

Our business is affected by general
economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we
operate. The current economic conditions including the global recession could
adversely impact our business in 2010 and beyond, resulting in:

•

reduced
      demand for some of our products;

•

increased
      rate of order cancellations or
delays;

•

increased
      risk of excess and obsolete
inventories;

•

increased
      pressure on the prices for our products and services;
  and

•

greater
      difficulty in collecting accounts
receivable.

Development of our products requires
significant investment; our products and technologies could become uncompetitive
or obsolete.

Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and
manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends
and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’
products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future
activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and
services that do not lead to significant revenue.

Many of our existing products and
those under development are technologically innovative and require significant
planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and
manufacturing-process levels. These activities require us to make significant
investments.

Products in our markets undergo
rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry
standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make
existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors
may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’
requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or
those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or
accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become
uncompetitive or obsolete.

Demand for most of our products
depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding
policies.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies,
laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public
and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy
spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a
significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These
policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our
products.

THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
1A.         Risk Factors
(continued)

As a multinational corporation, we
are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely
affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International revenues
account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue
expanding our presence in international markets. In 2009, our international
revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United
States, accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues. The
exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange
rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S.
dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where
payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a
multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party
customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business
(the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the
functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of
operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our
international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial
reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our
international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2009, currency
translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations
of $211 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies in which the company sells products and services.

Healthcare reform legislation could
adversely impact us.

The U.S. Congress is debating healthcare reform that
could have an adverse impact on us. Some of the potential changes, such as a
reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in
legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare
services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry
participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the
prices they are willing to pay for our products or services. Changes in tax laws
relating to healthcare reform, such as the proposal in the bill approved by the
House of Representatives that would assess an annual tax on revenue from the
sale of medical devices, would have an adverse impact on our results of
operations.

Our inability to protect our
intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In
addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property,
and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a
result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade
secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes
because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products
through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in
part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent
protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We
own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional
applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not
be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to
us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently
broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us
may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these
patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors
may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual
property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries,
which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us
or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An
unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

We also rely on trade secrets and
proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by
confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any
breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be
independently developed by our competitors.

FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
1A.         Risk Factors
(continued)

Third parties may assert claims
against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property
rights. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources
in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, parties
making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as
well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our
ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in
the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual
property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold
pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek
licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we
may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at
all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain
the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or
distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Changes in governmental regulations
may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete
in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state,
local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety
and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to
meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in
regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For
example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for
use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could
have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.

If any of our security products fail
to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and
related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.

The
products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive
range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace
explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo
facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection
and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction,
it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the
product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also
many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such
as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training
of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be
significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of
our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot
be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims
or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our inability to successfully
identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous
acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that
complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions
are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including
competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including
antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete
transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial
premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further,
we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our
existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated
cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could
adversely affect our business.

Moreover, we have acquired many
companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded
significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance
sheet, which amount to approximately $8.98 billion and $1.33 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2009. We assess the realizability of the
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-

lived
intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these
businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges
relating to the impairment of those assets.

THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
1A.         Risk Factors
(continued)

Our growth
strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the integration of
future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing
operations.

We are subject to laws and
regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws
and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.

We
have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and,
as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government
contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government
contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to
private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the
regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these
regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and
administrative penalties or debarment.

Because we compete directly with
certain of our largest customers and product suppliers, our results of
operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or
suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with
us.

Our largest customer in the laboratory consumables business and our
largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors.
Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in
the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their
purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly
with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source
competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely
affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly
discontinues selling products to us.

Because we rely heavily on
third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these
services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship
products, increase our costs and lower our profitability

. We ship a
significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package
delivery companies, such as UPS and Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in
Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of
our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national
and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal
Service. If UPS or another third-party package-delivery provider experiences a
major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely
fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to
our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of
our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if UPS or our other
third-party package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to
find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our
profitability could be adversely affected.

We are subject to regulation by
various federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a
wide variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of
products, the shipping of our products and environmental matters.

Some of
our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and similar international agencies. These regulations govern a
wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling,
manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations or those of similar
international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their
manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our
revenues.

We are subject to federal, state,
local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling,
transportation, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be
classified as toxic or hazardous substances. Some risk of environmental damage
is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, sell or
distribute.

This
requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations, including the establishment of
reserves to address potential environmental costs, and manage environmental
risks.

FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
1A.         Risk Factors
(continued)

We rely heavily on manufacturing
operations to produce the products we sell, and our business could be adversely
affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operation.

We rely upon our
manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell. Any
significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or
other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events
beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships
and therefore adversely affect our business. Although most of our raw materials
are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend
upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable
to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to
produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of
these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations.

Fluctuations in our

effective tax rate may adversely
affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.

As a
global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and
other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the
amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and
other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax
rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to
numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from
country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted
and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of
these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly
different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash
flows.

We may incur unexpected costs from
increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and
cash flow.

Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based
resins, steel and serum. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price
increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures,
our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these
measures are insufficient to cover our costs.

Unforeseen problems with the
implementation and maintenance of our information systems or system failures at
certain of our sites could interfere with our operations.

As a part of
the effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new
enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage
certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality,
problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely
impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our
business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide
accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be
difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We also rely on our technology
infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our
products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship
products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our
customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our
systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,
power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses,
computer denial-of-service attacks and other events. When we upgrade or change
systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced
functionality. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster
recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any
precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other
consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and
financial results.

Our debt may restrict our investment
opportunities or limit our activities.

As of December 31, 2009, we had
approximately $2.18 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the
ability to borrow an additional $946 million under our revolving credit
facility. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to
meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total
leverage.

Our leverage could have negative
consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and
industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and
limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic
acquisitions.

Our ability to satisfy our
obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic,
financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may
not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations. If we are unable to
service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay
strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development
expenditures. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms
acceptable to us or at all.

Additionally, the agreements
governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and
contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by,
among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness,
make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with
affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a
debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any
lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is
outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the
facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the
facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated
Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to
be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.

Our ability to comply with these
financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance,
which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including
factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may
result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could
permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay
that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under
one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our
debt instruments.

We own approximately 81,000 square
feet of office space in Massachusetts. We also lease approximately 54,000 square
feet of office space principally in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts under various
leases that expire between 2010 and 2016.

We believe that all of the
facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable
and adequate to meet our current needs. If we are unable to renew any of the
leases that are due to expire in 2010 or 2011, we believe that suitable
replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable
terms.

Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of
product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business. We are a
party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and
consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have
distributed or manufactured. These matters have arisen in the ordinary course
and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions. We believe that
some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of
these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by
insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to
indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers. Management, after review and
consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respect
to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. While liabilities arising from
potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the
basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future
claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Actual costs incurred will depend on the
solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any
particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of
third parties who may be jointly and severally liable. See “Item 1 –
Business – Environmental Matters,” for legal proceedings involving certain
environmental matters.

We are subject to the jurisdiction
of various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration and the Agency for International Development. Various
governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine
matters relating to our operations. Some operations involve and have involved
the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as
toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental
laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in
particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in
similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or
be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the
future.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations

Reference is
made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which
begin on page F-1 of this report.

Overview
of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The company develops, manufactures
and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands
the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its
own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary
businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments:
Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. During each of the
first quarters of 2009 and 2008, the company transferred management
responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for a small
product line between segments. The company has historically moved a product line
between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a
segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that
in which it had previously been reported. Segment information for all periods
presented has been reclassified to reflect these transfers. Revenues in the
fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital
spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government
customers.

Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a
decrease of $388 million from 2008. Aside from the effects of currency
translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures (discussed in total and by
segment below), revenues decreased from 2008 revenues by $342 million (3%) due
to lower revenues at existing businesses as a result of decreased demand, offset
in part by price increases. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services
were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases
due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however,
and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic
conditions.

The company’s strategy is to augment
internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as
those completed in 2009 and 2008. The principal acquisitions in 2009 were
Biolab, an Australia-based provider of analytical instruments, life science
consumables and laboratory equipment in April 2009 and B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a
leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for
sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care
treatments and prenatal screening in October 2009. Biolab broadened the
geographic reach of the company’s customer channels. BRAHMS increased the
breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provided a
significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe.

In 2009, operating income and
operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared
with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating
income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from
decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity
improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and
global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs
increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain
in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in
2009 due to the economic downturn.

Operations – Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity
(continued)

The company’s effective tax rates
were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the
effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax
jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was

favorably affected by $5.5
million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve
established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly
enacted tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be
between 17% and 19% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the
countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2008 was
favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the
impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state rates
and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland.

Income from continuing operations
decreased to $851 million in 2009, from $975 million in 2008, primarily due to
the items discussed above that decreased operating income, offset in part by a
lower tax rate.

During 2009, the company’s cash flow
from operations totaled $1.66 billion, compared with $1.42 billion for 2008. The
increase resulted primarily from decreased investment in working capital items,
particularly accounts receivable and inventories.

As of December 31, 2009, the
company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.18 billion, of which approximately $0.66
billion is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20
per share. As of December 31, 2009, $340 million of the convertible debt
was currently convertible. During 2009 and early 2010, holders of debentures
totaling $68 million in par value exercised conversion rights. Upon an
investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original
principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion
value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders
electing to convert in 2010, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit
facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $113 million which has been
classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The
facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with
available capacity of $946 million at December 31, 2009.

The company believes that its
existing cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion as of December 31,
2009, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available
borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet
the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future,
including at least the next 24 months.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and
analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis,
management evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity
investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations,
intangible assets and goodwill, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension
costs, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation, restructuring and
sale of businesses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive
judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial
statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these
estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
(continued)

The company believes the following
represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation
of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts
Receivable

The
company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such
allowances totaled $47 million at December 31, 2009. The company estimates the
amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the
receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that
is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s
customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments,
additional allowances would be required.

(b)

Inventories

The
company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and
obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable
value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected
demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate
usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional
writedowns may be required.

(c)

Intangible Assets and
Goodwill

The
company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant
portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned
to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining
(i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or
non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the
intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of
acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash
flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired
businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present
value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets
totaled $5.01 billion at December 31, 2009. The company reviews definite-lived
intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists,
such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual
cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected
cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at
the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such
asset.

The
company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair
value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might
require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions,
economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities,
loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.98 billion and $1.33 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2009. Estimates of future cash flows require
assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related
expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions
from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash
flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment.

Financial Statement Index

FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
7.           Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

The
company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic
downturn, although results progressively improved during the year. Projections
of profitability for 2010 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer
revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no
impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December
31, 2009. There can be no assurance, however, that indicators of economic
recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not
materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses
such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets
become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or
indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating
performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result
of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be
necessary.

(d)

Other Long-lived
Assets

The
company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of
potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows
associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.77 billion at
December 31, 2009, including $1.33 billion of fixed assets. In testing a
long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash
flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require
assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related
expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should
future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for
impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.

(e)

Revenues

In
instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation
obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment
when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation
when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the
equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of
sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change,
the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not
available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred
until delivery of all elements is completed.

In
instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance
criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the
acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the
timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance
criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not
demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional
revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance
testing.

The
company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and
services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based
on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor
specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered
elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element,
revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is
completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair
value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price
charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from
training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based
on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the
services are sold separately.

The
company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by
customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional
adjustments to revenue may be required.

(f)

Warranty
Obligations

At the
time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of
product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical
experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate
projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for
warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $45 million
at December 31, 2009. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of
correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated
warranty liability would be necessary.

(g)

Income
Taxes

In the
ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the
company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and
records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon
management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at
the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not
that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest
amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full
knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it
is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit
has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated
interest expense has also been recognized.

The
company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result,
is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax
authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation
of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions
regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of
deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the
sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws,
regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the
company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could
have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence
the company’s net income.

The
company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will
result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and
provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it
believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not
that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the
related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of
the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled
$164.8 million at December 31, 2009. Should the company’s actual future taxable
income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or
reversals thereof may be necessary.

The
company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax
jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $28 million at
December 31, 2009. Should tax return positions that the company expects are
sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record
an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax
benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision
would result.

(h)

Contingencies and
Litigation

The
company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings,
environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and
other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based
on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of
losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or
external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses,
including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and
discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records
receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be
probable.

(i)

Pension and Other
Retiree Benefits

Several
of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension
and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements
are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee
earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until
the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these
employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets
and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined
based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with
third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement
date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other
postretirement benefit plans totaled $16 million in 2009. The company’s unfunded
benefit obligation totaled $225 million at year-end 2009 compared with $303
million at year-end 2008. Should any of these assumptions change, they would
have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit
obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an
annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of
approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of
approximately $85 million.

The
company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit
pension plans in 2010.

(j)

Stock-based
Compensation

The fair
value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock
units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice
model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires
management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical
volatility of the company’s stock. The expected lives of option grants
through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla”
options. Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for
determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based
on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the
expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input
variables would affect the amount of expense associated
with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for
all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company
estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of
option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated
forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.

Restructuring
Costs

The
company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based
on future lease obligations net of expected sub-rental income. The company’s
accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities totaled $7 million at
December 31, 2009. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income
from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be
required.

(l)

Assets Held for
Sale

The
company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when
necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to
estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would
include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates,
results could differ from expected amounts.

Results
of Operations

2009 Compared With

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a
decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency
translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales
increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the
effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues
decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the
company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price
increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser
extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers
reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew
modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic
conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in
Asia.

In the latter part of 2009, the
dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells
products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on
revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009
compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.

In 2009, operating income and
operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared
with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating
income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from
decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity
improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and
global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs
increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain
in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in
2009 due to the economic downturn.

In 2009, the company recorded
restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of
charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the
date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be
abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling,
general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the
acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. on April 30, and October 1, 2009,
respectively, offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain
pre-merger Fisher product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62
million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the
economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several
businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are
being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned
facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge

for
pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a
litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006
(Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of
$37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the
sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated
depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility
consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for
severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic
uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility
expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company
also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisition-related
intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of
Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of
the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3
million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business.
These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a
pension plan in the U.S.

As of February 26, 2010, the company
has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of
approximately $38 million in 2010 and expects to identify additional actions
during 2010. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost
savings of approximately $107 million, including $59 million for actions taken
through the end of 2009 and $48 million for actions that have been approved and
will be completed in 2010. Of the $107 million of total savings, $63 million is
in the Analytical Technologies segment and $44 million is in the Laboratory
Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2008
resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2008 and early
2009 of approximately $34 million, including $26 million in the Analytical
Technologies segment and $8 million in the Laboratory Products and Services
segment.

The company's revenues and
profitability decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 although results progressively
improved during 2009. The company believes the decreases were primarily due to
the global economic downturn. There can be no assurance that indicators of
economic recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not
affect the company's projections of profitability for 2010 and future years. If
actual results decrease materially from projected results, impairment of
goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets could occur. These assets
totaled $8.98 billion and $6.34 billion, respectively, at December 31,
2009.

Segment
Results

The company’s management evaluates
segment operating performance using operating income before certain
charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative
expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and
other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as
severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real
estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand
and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of
performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following
segment data is reported on this basis.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies
segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects
of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in
2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In
addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and
acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%)
primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in
industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was
particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic
downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher
demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu
tests.

Operating income margin was 20.2% in
2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from
decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity
improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions
and global sourcing initiatives.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and
Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable
effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128
million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of
divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency
translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22
million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a
supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for
laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced
purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than
offset by higher demand for products purchased through the company’s research
market and healthcare market channels.

In July 2008, the company and a
significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing
agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company’s
revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61
million in 2009 to $205 million. In November 2009, the supplier notified the
company that it intended to cease the current arrangement. The company believes
this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its
product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic
solutions. As a result of the supplier terminating this agreement, the company
expects sales of related products to be approximately $75 million in 2010 and
none thereafter. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative
supplier of laboratory products and expects to sell approximately $40 million of
these and other products from the new supplier in 2010, offsetting a portion of
the anticipated drop in revenue.

Operating income margin decreased to
13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from
decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity
improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions
and global sourcing initiatives.

Other
Expense, Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4).
Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008
primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest
expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a
result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate
debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early
extinguishment of debt (Note 9).

Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates
were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the
effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax
jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million
or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve
established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly
enacted tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be
between 17% and 19% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the
countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2008 was
favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage

points
resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the
apportionment of state rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in
Switzerland.

Contingent
Liabilities

At the end of 2009, the company was
contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related
matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under
“Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10 could materially affect the
company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash
flows.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued a
pronouncement concerning fair value measurement accounting. This guidance
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The rule applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not
require any new fair value measurements. The pronouncement was effective for the
company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and for
non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009. There was no
material effect from adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB revised
the accounting rules concerning business combinations. This revised guidance
does the following: requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to
recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement
objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the
acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the
nature and financial effect of the business combination. The rules require that
cash outflows such as transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be
charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition.
Contingent purchase price is recorded at its initial fair value and then
re-measured periodically through adjustments to net income. The revised guidance
was effective for the company, on a prospective basis, beginning January 1,
2009. There was no impact upon adoption; however, the rule changes may
materially affect the accounting for any future business
combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new
rules on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The
noncontrolling interest guidance changed the accounting for minority interests,
which are reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component
of equity. This guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1,
2009, and there was no effect from adoption.

In March 2008, the FASB issued a
pronouncement pertaining to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This guidance requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The rule was
effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009, and there was no material
effect from adoption.

In May 2008, the FASB issued new rules
on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
upon conversion, including partial cash settlement of such debt instruments. The
rules require the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the
liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that
reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is
recognized in subsequent periods. The new guidance was effective for the company
beginning January 1, 2009. The rules required adjustment of prior periods to
conform to current accounting. The company’s cash payments for interest have not
been affected, but adoption increased the company’s reported

interest
expense for all periods presented in a manner that reflects interest rates of
similar non-convertible debt. Interest expense in 2008 and 2007, as adjusted for
adoption of this rule, increased $22 million and $21 million, respectively, over
the previously reported amounts.

In June 2008, the FASB issued
guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable
dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. The
guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The rule
required adjustment of prior periods to conform to current accounting. Adoption
had a nominal effect on the numerator and, for diluted presentation, the
denominator in the calculation of earnings per share for all periods
presented.

In December 2008, the FASB issued
guidance which requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets
of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands
current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to
include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets. The
guidance was effective for the company beginning in January 2009 and the
additional disclosures have been made.

In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. This
guidance amends the prior other-than-temporary impairment guidance for certain
debt securities and will require the investor to assess the likelihood of
selling the debt security prior to recovery of its cost basis. If an investor is
able to meet the criteria to assert that it does not intend to sell the debt
security and more likely than not will not be required to sell the debt security
before its anticipated recovery, impairment charges related to credit losses
would be recognized in earnings whereas impairment charges related to non-credit
losses would be reflected in other comprehensive income. The company elected
early adoption of this rule in the first quarter of 2009. Adoption did not
materially affect the company’s financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on providing interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. This
new guidance requires the fair value disclosures that were previously disclosed
only annually to be disclosed now on an interim basis. This guidance was
effective for the company in the second quarter of 2009, and the additional
disclosures have been made.

In May 2009, the FASB issued a
pronouncement on subsequent event accounting that establishes the period after
the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or
transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize
events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial
statements; and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or
transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The pronouncement was
effective for the company’s second quarter 2009, and there was no effect from
adoption.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the hierarchy of generally
accepted accounting principles. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or
the Codification, is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental
generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The Codification
was effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In September 2009, the Emerging
Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue
arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled
products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has
multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing
the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence does not
exist. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling
price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s
consideration using this relative

selling
price model. The new guidance pertaining to software-enabled products revised
the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the
software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Upon adoption of
the new standard, such equipment will be accounted for under revenue recognition
criteria applicable to equipment instead of that applicable to software. Both of
these new rules can be prospectively applied beginning January 1, 2011 or can be
early or retrospectively adopted. The company expects to adopt both of these new
rules effective January 1, 2010. Adoption of these new standards is not expected
to materially affect the company’s financial statements.

Discontinued
Operations

During 2008, the company recorded
additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related
to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million.
The note was collected in July 2008.

2008 Compared With

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion,
an increase of $752 million from 2007. The favorable effects of currency
translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $113 million in 2008. Sales
increased $186 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the
effect of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues
increased $453 million primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser
extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was very strong
in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe although in the fourth
quarter of 2008, growth slowed in Asia and improved in Europe.

In the latter part of 2008, the U.S.
dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells
product and services. Strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the
amount of revenues the company reported in U.S. dollars of approximately 4% in
the fourth quarter of 2008.

In 2008, operating income and
operating income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared
with $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating
income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from
incremental revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and
productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs
following restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of
lower cost of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of
lower restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment
gain in 2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were
offset in part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of
acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008
acquisitions.

Restructuring and other costs were
recorded during 2008 and 2007. In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and
other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of
revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition
and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to
facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs
primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to
economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned
facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The
company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of
acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit
acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter
assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of
businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an
acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the
curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. In 2007, the company recorded
restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million,

including
$49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the
sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher).
The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance,
abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been
consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small
business unit. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual
cost savings of approximately $11 million, primarily in the Analytical
Technologies segment.

to the introduction of new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of
scientific instruments and specialty diagnostics. Sales growth slowed in the
latter part of 2008 due to lower fourth quarter sales of environmental
monitoring equipment and process instruments which were unfavorably affected by
a downturn in industrial markets.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and
Services segment increased $542 million to $6.46 billion in 2008. The favorable
effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $39 million in 2008.
Sales increased $163 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In
addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and
acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $340 million primarily due
to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Sales made through
the segment’s research market and healthcare market channels and revenues from
the company’s biopharma services were particularly strong. These increases in
revenue were offset in part by lower sales in early 2008 made through the
segment’s safety market channel. The safety market channel sales are in part
dependent on expenditures for homeland security that vary based on government
spending priorities.

Operating income margin increased to
14.2% in 2008 from 13.8% in 2007, primarily due to profit on incremental revenue
and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring
actions, offset in part by the impact of inflation on commodities such as raw
resin, steel and plastics as well as higher fuel and freight costs.

Other
Expense, Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $101 million and $114 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other
expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments,
net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. The
decrease was primarily due to $9 million of lower interest expense as a result
of reduced market rates on variable rate debt and redemption of $129 million of
long-term debt due in October 2008.

Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rate was
13.5% and 10.9% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was
favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the
impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax
rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the
impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in
income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably
affected by $32 million or 3.7 percentage points resulting from enacted
reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on
the company’s deferred tax balances.

Discontinued
Operations

During 2008, the company recorded
additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related
to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million.
The note was collected in July 2008.

In 2007, the company recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of $29 million on a business held for sale and
subsequently sold. The loss primarily represented the carrying value of the
business in excess of the estimated disposal value. Aside from the impairment
loss, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued
operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a
business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from
litigation related to a divested business.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was
$2.89 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $2.81 billion at December 31,
2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash. Included in working
capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.57 billion
at December 31, 2009 and $1.29 billion at December 31, 2008.


Cash provided by operating
activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and
inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A
decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts
receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in
inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009
over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily
due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally
severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used
cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330
million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2009, the company’s primary
investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant
and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208
million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In January and February
2010, the company entered agreements to acquire three businesses for aggregate
cash consideration of approximately $225 million and future contingent
consideration of up to an additional $30 million.

The company’s financing activities
used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of
debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the company’s common stock, offset in
part by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $748 million. In
December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal
outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption
price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued
interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282
million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due
2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587
million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). The company’s financing
activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option
exercises. On September 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $500 million of the company’s common stock through September
10, 2009. At December 31, 2009, no remaining authorization existed for
repurchases of the company’s common stock.

The company has no material
commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for
all of 2010, such expenditures will approximate $275 to $300
million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

As of December 31, 2009, the
company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.18 billion, of which approximately $0.66
billion is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20
per share. As of December 31, 2009, $340 million of the convertible debt
was currently convertible. During 2009 and early 2010, holders of debentures
totaling $68 million in par value exercised conversion rights. Upon an
investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original
principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion
value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders
electing to convert in 2010, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit
facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $113 million which has been
classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The
facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with
available capacity of $946 million at December 31, 2009.

The company believes that its
existing cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion as of December 31,
2009, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available
borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet
the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future,
including at least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating
activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used
$124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in
accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million,
respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth
in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292
million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no
longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring
actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate
consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008.

During 2008, the company’s primary
investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant
and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264
million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.

The company’s financing activities
used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187
million of the company’s common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt,
offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds
of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of
tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.


Cash provided by operating
activities was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of
refunds, totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S.
estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for
merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards.
The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced
operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing
operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate
consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007.

During 2007, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations were acquisitions and the
purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on
acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48
million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19
million, principally real

estate.
The company’s discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from
investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac
Limited.

The company’s
financing activities used $929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the
repayment of $464 million of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million
of the company’s common stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option
exercises. The company had proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of
employee stock options and $97 million of tax benefits from the exercise of
stock options.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special
purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2007 -
2009 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other
guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table
below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees,
$3.5 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties,
principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to
guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of
business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Reserves for
unrecognized tax benefits of $76.2 million have not been included in the above
table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit
resolutions.

The company has no material
commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for
2010, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $275 to $300
million.

In disposing of assets or
businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or
indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to
investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the
disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential
liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of
operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities
for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See
Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these
liabilities.

Item

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
      Risk

The company is exposed to market
risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices
and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and
financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its
regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses
short-term forward and option contracts to manage certain exposures to
currencies and commodities. The company enters into these derivative contracts
to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than
its subsidiaries’ local currencies or impacted by commodity price movement. The
company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the company’s
cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The company’s currency-exchange
contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, Swiss franc,
Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and
Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts
are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying
exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative
agreements.

Interest
Rates

The company is exposed to changes in
interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of
ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as
well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2009, the company’s debt
portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to
interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt
will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The
total estimated fair value of the

Financial Statement Index



THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item
7A.         Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)

company’s
debt at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $2.56 billion and $2.15
billion, respectively. Fair values were determined from available market prices
using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to
decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December
31, 2009 would increase by approximately $68 million. In 2008, a 100 basis point
decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s
debt by approximately $52 million.

In addition, interest rate changes
would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate
debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis-point increase in
90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2009 and 2008, would increase the company’s annual
pre-tax interest expense by approximately $8 million and $3 million,
respectively.

Currency
Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in
international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s
reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international
subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The
functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are
principally denominated in Euros, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian
dollars, Chinese yuan and British pounds sterling. The effect of a change in
currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international
subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items”
component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2009 and 2008
functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction
of shareholders’ equity of $374 million and $306 million,
respectively.

The fair value of forward
currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount
that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking
into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in
year-end 2009 and 2008 currency exchange rates related to the company’s
contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward
currency-exchange contracts of $39 million and $24 million, respectively. The
unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses
or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and
cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange
rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2009 and 2008 currency
exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact
of $7 million and $8 million, respectively, on the company’s net
income.

Equity
Prices

The company’s available-for-sale
investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to
fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are
sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in
equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s
available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference
between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or
issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2009 and 2008
market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible
obligations by $87 million and $81 million, respectively.

Management’s
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the
participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
December 31, 2009. Based on this evaluation, the company’s chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, the
company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, reported and accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including
the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f))
for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria established
in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009,
the company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

The
company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report that
appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the
company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2009, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To

the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and December
31, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009

in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Annual Report on Form
10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements,
the financial statement schedule and on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for certain convertible debt instruments
effective January 1, 2009.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature
      of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Nature
of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the
company) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. The
company offers customers a complete range of high-end analytical instruments,
software, services, consumables and reagents to enable integrated laboratory
workflow solutions and a complete portfolio of laboratory equipment, chemicals,
supplies and services used in healthcare, scientific research, safety and
education. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech companies,
hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and
government agencies, as well as environmental and industrial process control
settings.

Principles
of Consolidation

The accompanying financial
statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns
between 20% and 50% using the equity method.

Subsequent
Events

The company has evaluated events and
transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through February 26, 2010
for recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and
notes.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all
significant obligations have been met, collectability is probable and title has
passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of
services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes
revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company
recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple
deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered
or completed based upon its relative fair value. If fair value is not available
for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery
is completed. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until
installation or acceptance, the company defers that portion of the revenue until
completion of installation or acceptance has been obtained. Provisions for
discounts, warranties, rebates to customers, returns and other adjustments are
provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.

The company recognizes revenue from
the sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of
perpetual licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement
exists, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has
occurred and collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often
include multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support.
The company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after
all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence
(VSOE) of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is
not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred
until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support
contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract,
which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software
maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the
maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and
consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE,
which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services
are sold separately.

Service revenues represent the
company’s service offerings including biopharma outsourcing, asset management,
diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field service including
related time and materials. Service revenues are recognized as the service is
performed. Revenues for service contracts are recognized ratably over the
contract period.

for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on historical
write-off experience. Past due balances are reviewed individually for
collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the
company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The
company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to
customers.

The company records shipping and
handling charges billed to customers in net sales and records shipping and
handling costs in cost of product revenues for all periods
presented.

Deferred revenue in the accompanying
balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue on service contracts, which
is recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. Substantially all of the
deferred revenue in the accompanying 2009 balance sheet will be recognized
within one year.

Warranty
Obligations

The company provides for the
estimated cost of product warranties, primarily from historical information, in
cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the
company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including
actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the
company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization
levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product
failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual
product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery
costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates,
revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability
for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance
sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of warranty obligations are as

Nature of Operations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Income
Taxes

The company recognizes deferred
income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences
between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

The financial statements reflect
expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has
taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full
knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for
the time value of money (Note 7).

Earnings
per Share

Basic earnings per share has been
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to
income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed
using the treasury stock method for the convertible obligations, warrants and
the exercise of stock options, as well as their related income tax effects (Note
8).

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists
principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable
securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These
investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and
debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered
short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. Such securities
principally represent available-for-sale investments. In addition, the company
owns marketable equity securities that represent less than 20% ownership and for
which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such
investments are also considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale
securities are carried at market value, with the difference between cost and
market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other
comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 11 and 12).
Decreases in market values of individual securities below cost for a duration of
six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary impairment, and
the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount of the
investments to market value through other expense, net, in the accompanying
statement of income (Note 4). Should a decrease in the market value of debt
securities be deemed attributable to non-credit loss conditions, however, no
impairment is recorded in the statement of income if the company has the ability
and intent to hold the investment to maturity.

Other investments for which there
are not readily determinable market values are accounted for under the cost
method of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which
provides that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the company had cost method investments
with carrying amounts of $10.4 million which are included in other
assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of
inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each
product or product line. In addition, the company has certain

inventory
that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying
value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company
records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying
value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the
procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and
receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues
in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as
follows:

and 2008, respectively, which was below estimated replacement cost by $17.4
million and $11.9 million, respectively. The company recorded a reduction in
cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories of $1.4
million and $0.2 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and a nominal benefit
in 2007.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides
for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements,
25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold
improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and only the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property,
plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related
Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible
assets include the costs of acquired product technology, patents, tradenames and
other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3
to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames that have indefinite lives
and which are not amortized. The company reviews other intangible assets for
impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant
reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with
indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related

Other
Assets

Other assets in the accompanying
balance sheet include deferred tax assets, insurance recovery receivables
related to product liability matters, notes receivable, cash surrender value of
life insurance, deferred debt expense, capitalized catalog costs, cost-method
investments, investments in joint ventures and other assets.

In May and July 2007, the company
contributed businesses with annualized third-party revenues and net assets of
$43 million and $101 million, respectively, to newly formed joint ventures with
third parties. The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s
capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint
venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and
disposable laboratory glass products. The company owns 49% - 50% of the joint
ventures and, following the formation of these entities, no longer consolidates
the results of the subsidiaries that were contributed but instead records its
pro rata share of the joint ventures’ results in other expense, net, in the
accompanying statement of income, using the equity method of accounting. The
results of the joint ventures were not material from their formation through
December 31, 2009. The company made purchases of products for resale from the
glass products joint venture totaling $45.1 million, $47.2 million and $20.9
million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability
of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it
may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence
of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or
more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of
its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer
market multiples. When an impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value
over the implied fair value of goodwill is recorded as an operating loss. The
company completed annual tests for impairment at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
determined that goodwill was not impaired.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

The company reviews legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from
contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or
normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists,
regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair
value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the
period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the
life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow
and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as interest
expense. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the company had recorded asset
retirement obligations of $22.5 million and $23.9 million,
respectively.

Accounts
Payable

The company reclassifies net book
overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Amounts reclassified to accounts
payable totaled $0.9 million and $24.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Loss
Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various
contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’
compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other
claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on
management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses
and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external
legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records
receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery
has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have
been recorded at their fair value and, as such, were discounted to their present
value at the dates of acquisition.

Advertising

The company expenses advertising
costs as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of
future benefit, generally one to three years. The company has capitalized
advertising costs of $6.3 million and $13.4 million at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing
costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed.
Advertising expense, which includes amortization of capitalized direct-response
advertising, as described above, was $72.9 million, $78.5 million and $76.0
million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in advertising expense
was catalog amortization of $11.1 million, $13.1 million and $12.7 million for
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Currency
Translation

All assets and liabilities of the
company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “Accumulated other
comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction
gains and losses are included in the accompanying statement of income and are
not material for the three years presented.

Derivative
Contracts

The company is exposed to certain
risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest
rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The company uses derivative
instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The
company recognizes all derivatives, including forward currency-exchange
contracts, in the balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
are recorded at fair value through earnings.

The company uses short-term forward
and option currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational
and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates.
Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are
denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective
operations. These contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros,
Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese
yen and Australian dollars. The company enters into these currency-exchange
contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases and sales as well as assets and
liabilities arising in the normal course of business, principally accounts
receivable and intercompany loans. Accordingly, the hedges are not speculative
in nature. As part of the company’s overall strategy to manage the level of
exposure to the risk of currency-exchange fluctuations, some business units
hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing
12-month period, using exchange contracts that have maturities of 12 months or
less. The company has elected not to account for its forward-currency exchange
contracts entered into for purposes other than anticipated purchases or sales as
hedges. These derivatives are recorded at fair value in its balance sheet in
other current assets or other accrued expenses with the changes in fair value
reflected immediately in earnings (Note 12). As of December 31, 2009, the
company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that were hedging
anticipated purchases or sales. The company does not hold or engage in
transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk
management.

Cash flow hedges.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As

of
December 31, 2009, the company had no outstanding derivative contracts that were
accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedges.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge,
the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.
During 2009, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into
interest rate swap arrangements (Notes 9 and 12). The company includes the gain
or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest
expense) as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate
swaps.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued a
pronouncement concerning fair value measurement accounting. This guidance
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The rule applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not
require any new fair value measurements. The pronouncement was effective for the
company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and for
non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009. There was no
material effect from adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB revised
the accounting rules concerning business combinations. This revised guidance
does the following: requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to
recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement
objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the
acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the
nature and financial effect of the business combination. The rules require that
cash outflows such as transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be
charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition.
Contingent purchase price is recorded at its initial fair value and then
re-measured periodically through adjustments to net income. The revised guidance
was effective for the company, on a prospective basis, beginning January 1,
2009. There was no impact upon adoption; however, the rule changes may
materially affect the accounting for any future business
combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued new
rules on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The
noncontrolling interest guidance changed the accounting for minority interests,
which are reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component
of equity. This guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1,
2009, and there was no effect from adoption.

In March 2008, the FASB issued a
pronouncement pertaining to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This guidance requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The rule was
effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009, and there was no material
effect from adoption.

Nature of Operations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

In May 2008, the FASB issued new rules
on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash
upon conversion, including partial cash settlement of such debt instruments. The
rules require the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the
liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that
reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is
recognized in subsequent periods. The new guidance was effective for the company
beginning January 1, 2009. The rules required adjustment of prior periods to
conform to current accounting. The company’s cash payments for interest have not
been affected, but adoption increased the company’s reported interest expense
for all periods presented in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar
non-convertible debt.

The incremental effects of applying
this convertible debt accounting on individual line items in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2008, were as follows:

When any of the convertible debt
instruments are convertible at the balance sheet date, the excess of the amount
of cash required to be paid to the holder upon conversion over the current
carrying amount of the long-term obligation is classified on the balance sheet
as temporary equity under the caption “incremental convertible debt
obligation.”

In June 2008, the FASB issued
guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable
dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. The
guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The rule
required adjustment of prior periods to conform to current accounting. Adoption
had a nominal effect on the numerator and, for diluted presentation, the
denominator in the calculation of earnings per share for all periods
presented.

In December 2008, the FASB issued
guidance which requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets
of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands
current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to
include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets. The
guidance was effective for the company beginning in January 2009 and the
additional disclosures have been made.

In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. This
guidance amends the prior other-than-temporary impairment guidance for certain
debt securities and will require the investor to assess the likelihood of
selling the debt security prior to recovery of its cost basis. If an investor is
able to meet the criteria to assert that it does not intend to sell the debt
security and more likely than not will not be required to sell the debt security
before its anticipated recovery, impairment charges related to credit losses
would be recognized in earnings whereas impairment charges related to non-credit
losses would be reflected in other comprehensive income. The company elected
early adoption of this rule in the first quarter of 2009. Adoption did not
materially affect the company’s financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on providing interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. This
new guidance requires the fair value disclosures that were previously disclosed
only annually to be disclosed now on an interim basis. This guidance was
effective for the company in the second quarter of 2009, and the additional
disclosures have been made.

Nature of Operations and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

In May 2009, the FASB issued a
pronouncement on subsequent event accounting that establishes the period after
the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or
transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize
events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial
statements; and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or
transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The pronouncement was
effective for the company’s second quarter 2009, and there was no effect from
adoption.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance
on the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the hierarchy of generally
accepted accounting principles. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or
the Codification, is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental
generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The Codification
was effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In September 2009, the Emerging
Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue
arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled
products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has
multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing
the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence does not
exist. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling
price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s
consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance
pertaining to software-enabled products revised the existing software accounting
guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the
value of the product. Upon adoption of the new standard, such equipment will be
accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to equipment instead
of that applicable to software. Both of these new rules can be prospectively
applied beginning January 1, 2011 or can be early or retrospectively adopted.
The company expects to adopt both of these new rules effective January 1, 2010.
Adoption of these new standards is not expected to materially affect the
company’s financial statements.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were
made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets,
and in determining the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being
exited (Note 14). Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Acquisitions
      and Dispositions

Acquisitions

In April 2009, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Biolab, an Australia-based
provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory
equipment, for AUD 180 million (USD $132 million), net of cash acquired. The
acquisition broadened the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels.
Revenue of Biolab totaled AUD 178 million in its fiscal year ended May 2009. The
purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and,
accordingly, $62 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible.

Acquisitions
and Dispositions (continued)

In October
2009, the company’s Analytical Technologies segment acquired B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a
leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests, as well as intensive care
treatments and prenatal screening, for 331 million Euros (approximately $482
million including the assumption of $32 million of debt). The acquisition of
B.R.A.H.M.S. increased the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics
portfolio and provided a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe.
B.R.A.H.M.S. reported revenues in 2008 of 75 million Euros. The purchase price
exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $183
million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2009 the Analytical
Technologies segment acquired a culture media manufacturer and distributor in
Malaysia and Singapore; the remaining interest in a Mexico-based manufacturer
and distributor of bulk weighing products; and a developer of advanced,
miniaturized gas chromatography instruments. The Laboratory Products and
Services segment acquired a Spain-based distributor of laboratory
instrumentation and equipment and a Sweden-based distributor of clinical
chemistry analysis instruments. The aggregate consideration for these
acquisitions was $38 million.

The company paid contingent purchase
price obligations of $22 million in 2009, and also accrued as of December 31,
2009, through an increase to goodwill, an additional obligation of $5 million
for the achievement of specified operating results, for several acquisitions
completed prior to 2009.

Acquisitions

In 2008, the company’s Analytical
Technologies segment acquired the intellectual property of an
immunohistochemistry control slide business; a manufacturer and distributor of
analytical instruments serving the life sciences and environmental industries; a
provider of RNAi, genomics and antibody tools used by life science researchers;
a manufacturer and distributor of antibodies and reagents; a manufacturer of
water analysis systems; a manufacturer of histology and anatomical pathology
labeling and tracking products; and an iron testing reagent product line. The
company’s Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired, in separate
transactions, three distributors of laboratory equipment and consumables; a
manufacturer of carbon fiber centrifuge rotors; a network of depots providing
clinical trial packaging and distribution, and the intellectual property and
other assets of a manufacturer of automated cell factory equipment. No
individual acquisition exceeded $50 million in purchase price. Aggregate
consideration paid in 2008 for the acquisitions of both segments was $192
million cash, net of cash acquired, plus $8 million of assumed debt, and up to
$17 million of additional future payments based on the achievement of specified
milestones and operating results, of which $3 million was paid in 2009 and an
additional $5 million was earned and accrued as of December 31, 2009. The
company also paid purchase price obligations, transaction costs and post-closing
purchase price adjustments aggregating $11 million in 2008, for several
acquisitions completed prior to 2008.

Acquisitions

In September 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a
division of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. based in Mumbai, India.
Qualigens is India’s largest chemical manufacturer and supplier, serving
customers in a variety of industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical and
food and beverage. The purchase price totaled $59 million. The acquisition
provided an established business in a fast-growing region to extend the
company’s reach. Revenues of Qualigens totaled $24 million in 2006. The purchase
price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $25
million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In October 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Priority Solutions
International, a U.S.-based leading third-party logistics provider to the
pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The purchase price totaled $164
million, net of cash acquired and a $1 million post-closing purchase price
refund received in 2008. The acquisition broadened the segment’s clinical trials
management services offerings. Revenues of Priority Solutions totaled $96
million in 2006. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net
assets and, accordingly, $107 million was allocated to goodwill, $37 million of
which is tax deductible.

Acquisitions
and Dispositions (continued)

In October 2007, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment acquired NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a
U.S.-based supplier of UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific
instruments to the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The purchase
price totaled $156 million, net of cash acquired and including $12 million of
payments made in 2008 and $15 million paid in 2009. Of the $12 million of
payments made in 2008, $10 million represented contingent consideration earned
for achievement of specified operating results in 2007 and $2 million
represented a post-closing purchase price adjustment. Of the $15 million paid in
2009, $8 million represented deferred purchase price and $7 million represented
contingent consideration earned for the achievement of specified operating
results in 2008. In addition, the purchase agreement calls for additional
contingent consideration of up to $10 million based on the successful approval
of certain pending patent applications. The acquisition broadened the segment’s
technology offerings. Revenues of NanoDrop totaled $27 million in 2006. The
purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and,
accordingly, $76 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax
deductible.

In December 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired La-Pha-Pack, a European-based
manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories.
The purchase price totaled $50 million, net of cash acquired, and included $4
million of contingent consideration based upon 2008 operating results which was
earned and accrued as an obligation at December 31, 2008 through an increase to
goodwill. The acquisition broadened the segment’s chromatography consumables
offerings and expanded its geographic coverage in Europe. Revenues of
La-Pha-Pack totaled $21 million in 2006. The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $12 million was allocated to
goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition to the acquisitions
described above, in 2007 the Analytical Technologies segment acquired a
distributor of mass spectrometry, chromatography and surface science
instruments, a manufacturer of high performance liquid chromatography pumps and
software, a manufacturer of electrostatic discharge products, the intellectual
property of a diagnostics business and the assets of a water testing business.
The Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired a provider of test,
measurement and process control instruments, an independent test and research
laboratory, a developer of liquid handling pipette tips and a cell culture
product line. The total aggregate consideration was $88 million, net of cash
acquired. The company also paid transaction costs and post-closing and
contingent purchase price adjustments aggregating $11 million in 2007 for
various acquisitions completed prior to 2007. The company obtained a refund of
$5 million in 2007 related to a post-closing adjustment for a 2006
acquisition.

The company’s acquisitions have
historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired assets,
resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of synergies of combining the
businesses. These synergies include elimination of redundant facilities,
functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure
to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial
infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of
company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results
have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs have been
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses beginning in
2009.  Allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions was based on
estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and, for acquisitions
completed within the past year, is subject to adjustment upon finalization of
the purchase price allocation. The company is not aware of any information that
indicates the final purchase price allocations will differ materially from the
preliminary estimates.

Business
Segment and Geographical Information (continued)

more
closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it
had previously been reported. Segment information for all periods presented has
been reclassified to reflect these transfers. The company’s segments are as
follows:

Analytical Technologies: serves
research scientists, as well as customers in healthcare and clinical
laboratories, in manufacturing and in the field, with a suite of advanced
analytical technologies, including scientific instruments, robotics and software
for creating advanced integrated workflows. The segment also includes a range of
diagnostic reagents and instruments used by hospitals and reference
laboratories.

Laboratory Products and Services:
serves life science, healthcare and safety markets with a broad portfolio of
products and consumables used for routine laboratory processes, as well as a
range of biopharma outsourcing services such as clinical packaging and
biological sample management. The segment also includes the company’s extensive
customer channels network consisting of catalog, e-commerce and other sales
avenues.

The company’s management evaluates
segment operating performance based on operating income before certain
charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative
expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and
other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as
severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real
estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and
evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of
performance for determining compensation.

Other
      Expense, Net

As discussed in Note 1, although the
company’s cash interest payments have not been affected, the adoption of the new
convertible debt accounting guidance has increased the company’s reported
interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar
non-convertible debt. The rule required adjustment of prior periods to conform
to current accounting.

The company acquired 5,660,000
shares of Nanogen Inc. as a result of the Fisher merger. In December 2007, the
company recorded a loss of $8.9 million on the investment in Nanogen for other
than temporary impairment following a decline in the quoted fair market value of
the shares that occurred between April and December 2007. In 2008 and 2009, the
company recorded losses of $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, on the
investment in Nanogen for other than temporary impairment. The investment in
Nanogen was sold in 2009 for nominal proceeds.

The company also recorded charges of
$2.9 million and $4.9 million in 2009 and 2008 for other than temporary
impairment of other investments that decreased in value primarily in the prior
6-9 months.

Loss on investments, net also
includes portfolio gains from the company’s day-to day investing
activities.

During 2009, the company redeemed
all of its outstanding 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and settled a
tender offer for its 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (Note 9). As a
result of these transactions, the company recorded a loss on the early
extinguishment of debt of $15 million, which is included in other items, net in
the above table.

Stock-based
      Compensation Plans

The company has stock-based
compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans
permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including
restricted stock, stock options, stock bonus shares or performance-based shares,
as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors
or for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee,
which consists of its chief executive officer. Options granted prior to July
2000 under these plans vested over 0-10 years and had terms ranging from 3-12
years. Options granted in or after July 2000 under these plans generally vested
over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with
certain exceptions. The company practice is to grant options at

value. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy
option exercises. Grants of stock options and restricted stock on or after
November 9, 2006, provide that upon a future change in control of the company
and qualifying termination of an option holder’s employment, all options and
service-based restricted stock awards held by the recipient become immediately
vested unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for
different treatment.

Compensation cost is based on the
grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting
period or to the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if
earlier.

The company has elected to recognize
any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess
of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after
considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The
company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related
to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by
the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach
for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess
of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $25.1 million and $99.1
million, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. A tax charge of $1.6 million was
recorded in capital in excess of par value in 2009 for the excess of deferred
tax asset over actual tax benefits realized at option exercise.

Stock
Options

The fair value of most option grants
is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants
that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice
model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is
generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to
make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected
volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s
stock. The average expected life of grants through 2007 was estimated using the
simplified method for “plain vanilla” options. Thereafter, historical data on
exercise patterns became the basis for estimating the expected life of an
option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date
of grant. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net
of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of
actual option forfeitures.

As of December 31, 2009, there was

options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2015 with a
weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years.

Restricted
Share/Unit Awards

The company awards to a number of
key employees restricted company common stock or restricted units that convert
into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest
in annual installments over three years, assuming continued employment, with
some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain
service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance
and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the
grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of
restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends,
whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to
receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based
restricted share/unit awards is determined based on the number of shares/units
granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For
awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to
estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and
other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible
U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both
the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of
employee contributions. Certain of the company’s subsidiaries offer retirement
plans in lieu of participation in the company’s 401(k) savings plans. Company
contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In
2009, 2008 and 2007, the company charged to expense $64.4 million, $55.5 million
and $56.8 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution
plans.

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of non-U.S.
and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of
the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The
company also has a postretirement healthcare program in which certain employees
are eligible to participate. The costs of the healthcare program are funded on a
self-insured and insured-premium basis.

The company recognizes the funded
status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an
asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair
value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) that arise but were
not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later
recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

When an employer is acquired as part
of a merger, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is
recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected
benefit obligation is recognized as a plan asset. The recognition of a new
liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing
unrecognized net gain or loss, (b) unrecognized prior service cost and (c)
unrecognized net transition obligation.

The company funds annually, at a
minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the company made contributions of approximately
$41.1 million, $20.7 million and $54.2 million, respectively. Contributions are
estimated at between $20 and $30 million for 2010.

The ultimate healthcare cost trend
rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between
2014 and 2026.

The discount rate reflects the rate
the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would
provide cash sufficient to settle its current

pension
obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors,
including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and
the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the
company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with
maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate
the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the
funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the
projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan
assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset
classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition,
the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other
professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

Asset management objectives include
maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and
market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future
benefit payment requirements.

The expected rate of compensation
increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on
historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future
salary increases.

The amounts in accumulated other
comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic
benefit cost in 2010 are as follows:

Domestic
Pension Plan Assets

The company’s overall objective is
to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of
institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth. The strategic asset
allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed
income and global equities. The company also has a small portfolio (comprising
less than 5% of invested assets) of private equity investments. The target
allocations for the remaining

investments
are approximately 34% to funds investing in US equities, including a
sub-allocation of approximately 5% to real estate-related equities,
approximately 29% to funds investing in international equities and approximately
37% to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains
enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit
payments.

Non-U.S.
Pension Plan Assets

The company maintains specific plan
assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the US. The investment
strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country
specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Most of the plans have
contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit
obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly
in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of
diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments are
substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income
securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 50% -
60% for equities and 40% - 50% for fixed income. Each plan maintains enough
liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The company estimates the degree to
which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on
expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance
for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more
likely than not go unused. At the time of the merger with Fisher in November
2006, the company established a $41.9 million valuation allowance for foreign
tax credit carryforwards that it did not expect would be used based on the
combined company’s tax position. During 2008, the company reduced its valuation
allowance for the foreign tax credit carryforwards by $41.9 million, all of
which reduced goodwill, due to an expectation that the benefit will be realized.
At December 31, 2009, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to
deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will
reduce income tax expense.

At December 31, 2009, the company
had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $148.2
million, $566.6 million and $745.4 million, respectively. Use of the
carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2010
through 2029. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $249.3 million
expire in the years 2010 through 2029, and the remainder do not expire. The
company also had $126.8 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as
of December 31, 2009, which expire in the years 2010 through 2019.

A provision has not been made for
U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $3.2 billion of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the
U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested
overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the
U.S. without an associated net tax cost. During 2009, the company changed its
position regarding the undistributed earnings of its Japan subsidiaries. The
earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered permanently reinvested.
As a result, in 2009 the company provided deferred U.S. income taxes of $28.0
million, offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $34.4 million.

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits

As of January 1, 2007, the company
had $82.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $33.2 million, if
recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate and the remaining $49.2 million,
if recognized, would have decreased goodwill. As of December 31, 2009, the
company had $76.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized,
would reduce the effective tax rate.

The company classified interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total
amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and
recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $5.3
million for interest.

The company conducts business
globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries
files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and
foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject
to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major
jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the
company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years before 2001.

During 2009, the statute of
limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $4.6
million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which
reduced income tax expense. During 2008, the statute of limitations on certain
unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $3.0 million decrease in
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which reduced goodwill.
During 2007, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits
lapsed which resulted in a $2.3 million decrease in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, $2.0 million of which reduced goodwill and $0.3
million of which reduced income tax expense.

In 2009, the company settled the IRS
audit of its 2005 tax year which resulted in a $0.9 million decrease in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which reduced income tax
expense. In 2008, the company settled IRS audits of the 2004 and 2005
pre-acquisition tax years of Fisher, which resulted in a $7 million decrease in
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill. This decrease in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits was substantially offset by an accrual
for unrecognized tax benefits related to the sale of a non-U.S. subsidiary.
During 2007, the company settled audits of the 2003 pre-acquisition tax years of
certain Fisher subsidiaries which resulted in a $2.6 million decrease in both
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill. The company also
settled audits of the 1994-1997 tax years of certain German subsidiaries which
resulted in a $7.1 million decrease in both the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and goodwill. The company is currently under audit by the Internal
Revenue Service for the 2001 to 2004 tax years. The examination of those years
is at the appeals level of the IRS. The company does not currently expect any
significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits. The
company is also currently under audit by the IRS for the 2006 and 2007 tax years
and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries. It is
likely that the examination phase of these audits will be completed within
twelve months. There have been no significant changes to the status of these
examinations during 2009, and the company does not currently expect any
significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax
benefits.

Options to purchase 10.9 million,

computation of diluted earnings per share for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Since the company must settle the
par value of its convertible notes in cash, the company is not required to
include any shares underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted
average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the
period exceeds the $23.73, $29.55, and $40.20 conversion price for the 2.50%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, the Floating Rate Senior Convertible
Debentures due 2033 and the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due
2024, respectively, and only to the extent of the additional shares the company
may be required to issue in the event the company’s conversion obligation
exceeds the principal amount of the notes or debentures converted (Note 9). At
such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury
stock method of accounting for share dilution) are included, which is based upon
the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion
price.

Debt
and Other Financing Arrangements (continued)

Credit
Facilities

The company has a revolving credit
facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a bank group that provides for
up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit that will expire
in August 2012. The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or
a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s
option. The rate at December 31, 2009, was between 0.40% and 0.62% (depending on
duration) under the more favorable of the two rates. The Revolving Credit
Facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount
available for borrowing. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and
financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this
type. The financial covenant requires the company to maintain total leverage
below a certain maximum level. The company was in compliance with all covenants
between 2007 and 2009. The credit agreement permits the company to use the
facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock,
debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate
purposes. As of December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the revolver
and $53.9 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $946.1 million
of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Money
Market Loans

The company has an uncommitted line
of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market
loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market
loans typically have maturity periods of between one and three months, however
they can have longer durations as the market will bear. Furthermore, they bear
varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time
of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, the company did not have any outstanding
borrowings under this line.

2.50%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

At the November 2006 closing date of
the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $300.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023. Interest on the notes is
payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The notes are convertible at the
option of the holder, at a price of $23.73 per share, if the common stock price
exceeds the trigger price of $28.48 for a period of time as defined in the
agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The company will be
required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion, up to the principal amount
of the notes converted. The company will have the option to satisfy any amount
of conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount in cash and/or shares
of common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the
company’s option on or after October 2, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount
plus accrued interest. In addition, holders of the notes have the option,
subject to certain conditions, to require the company to purchase any notes held
by them for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on October 1,
2010, October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2020, or upon a change of
control.

During the fourth quarter of 2009,
the company made a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all outstanding
2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 at a purchase price per $1,000 principal
amount of $2,072.4743. At the expiration of the offer, the company purchased
$282.3 million aggregate principal amount of such notes for an aggregate of
$586.6 million including accrued and unpaid interest. The company recorded a
loss of $10 million in 2009 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other
expense, net on the accompanying statement of income.

Floating
Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033

At the closing date of the merger
with Fisher, the company assumed $344.4 million aggregate principal amount of
Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033. Interest on the notes is
payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year at an
annual rate of 90-day LIBOR minus 1.25% (0.00% as of December 31, 2009).
Additional quarterly interest equal to 0.0625% of the market value of the notes
will be paid commencing

with the
quarterly interest period beginning December 15, 2009, if the market value of
the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal
value. Based on the market value of the notes at the most recent testing period,
the additional interest charge in 2010 is expected to be less than $1 million.
The notes are convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $29.55 per
share, if the common stock price exceeds the trigger price of $38.41 for a
period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain
other events. The company will be required to deliver cash to holders upon
conversion, up to the principal amount of notes converted. The company will have
the option to satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of the
principal amount in cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may be
redeemed, in whole or in part, at the company’s option on or after March 15,
2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition,
holders of the notes have the option, subject to certain conditions, to require
the company to purchase any notes held by them for 100% of the principal amount
plus accrued interest on March 15, 2010, December 15, 2014, December 15, 2019,
December 15, 2024, and December 15, 2029, or upon a change of

3.25%
Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024

At the closing date of the merger
with Fisher, the company assumed $330.0 million aggregate principal amount of
3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024. Interest on the notes is
payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes are convertible at
the option of the holder, at a price of $40.20 per share, if the common stock
price exceeds the trigger price of $48.24 for a period of time as defined in the
agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The company will be
required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion, up to the principal amount
of notes converted. The company will have the option to satisfy any amount of
conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount in cash and/or shares of
common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the company’s
option, on or after March 2, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest. In addition, holders of the notes have the option, subject to certain
conditions, to require the company to purchase any notes held by them for 100%
of the principal amount plus accrued interest on March 1, 2011, March 1, 2016
and March 1, 2021, or upon a change of control.

For any holders of the company’s
convertible obligations electing to convert or if such debt is put to the
company by holders on the next put dates in 2010 and 2011, the company currently
intends to finance the cash payments that would be payable through borrowings
under its revolving credit agreement to the extent such payments exceed $113
million which has been classified as a current maturity of long-term obligation
in the accompanying 2009 balance sheet. During 2009 and early 2010, holders of
convertible debentures totaling $68 million in par value exercised conversion
rights.

The company separately accounts for

At the issuance of debt, the company
entered into 3 month LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various
banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the
2.15% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates
of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable
interest rate of 3 month USD LIBOR plus a spread of 0.4194% (0.77% at December

Debt
and Other Financing Arrangements (continued)

Prior to issuing this debt, the
company entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several
banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a
debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was
probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a
10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual
fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year
fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The change
in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax,
and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items
within shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the
term of the debt through 2015.

5/8% Senior Notes due 2008

The company had $128.7 million
principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2008. Interest on the notes was
payable on April 30 and October 30 of each year. The principal and accrued
interest on these notes was paid in full in 2008.

3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014

At the closing date of the merger
with Fisher, the company assumed $300 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest on the notes was payable on February 15
and August 15 of each year. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price of
103.375% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in December 2009 for a
total cash outlay of $317 million. The company recorded a loss of $5 million in
2009 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other expense, net on the
accompanying statement of income.

1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015

At the closing date of the merger
with Fisher, the company assumed $500 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on January 1 and
July 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the
company’s option, on or after July 1, 2010, at specified redemption prices plus
accrued interest. At any period prior to July 1, 2010, the company may redeem
the notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified
make-whole premium plus accrued interest. If a change of control occurs and the
notes fail to maintain at least a BBB- rating by S&P and a Baa3 rating by
Moody’s, each holder of notes may require the company to repurchase some or all
of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest.

Leases

The company leases certain
logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities. Income from continuing
operations includes expense from operating leases of $108.4 million, $108.8
million and $97.0 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following is
a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2009:

Purchase
Obligations

The company has entered into
unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that
include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and
legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions;
and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude
agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount
of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $172.2 million at
December 31, 2009 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be
settled during 2010.

Letters
of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding letters of credit and
bank guarantees totaled $100.7 million at December 31, 2009, including $3.5
million for businesses that have been sold. The expiration of these credits and
guarantees ranges through 2099.

Outstanding surety bonds and other
guarantees totaled $45.9 million at December 31, 2009. The expiration of these
bonds and guarantees ranges through 2011.

The letters of credit, bank
guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and
allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit,
bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform
as contractually required.

In connection with the sale of
businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual
obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with
respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a
transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer
defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be
liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the
company would be entitled to indemnification by the buyer.

The company has funding commitments
totaling $7.7 million at December 31, 2009, related to investments it
owns.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain
transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the
other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that
were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain
environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of
such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where
appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than
obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the
company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s
efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has
vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the
company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor
under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if
a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to
make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company
believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in
the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of
operations.

In connection with the sale of
products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes
representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe
on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers
against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been
required to make material payments under such provisions.

Litigation
and Related Contingencies

There are various lawsuits and
claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract,
commercial and other issues. In view of the company’s financial condition and
the accruals established for related matters, management does not believe that
the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

The company establishes a liability
that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events
that have already occurred. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s
judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially
determined estimates. The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional
information becomes known or payments are made.

The company accrues the most likely
amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of
probable loss can be estimated. The range of probable loss for product
liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the
company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2009, was approximately $222
million to $323 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these
liabilities assumed in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present)
value at the date of merger. The company’s reserve for these matters in total,
including the discounted liabilities, was $159 million at December 31, 2009 (or
$225 million undiscounted). The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is
gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $93 million at December 31, 2009
(or $133 million undiscounted). The portion of these insurance assets assumed in
the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of
merger. In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2009, the company
had product liability reserves of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested
businesses.

The assets and liabilities assumed
at the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of
expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free
rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted
average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of
approximately $66

million
and the discount on the assets of approximately $40 million (net discount $26
million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement
period.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Although the
company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable
and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of
loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries
involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate
amounts could vary materially. For example, there are pending lawsuits with
certain of the company’s insurers concerning which state’s laws should apply to
the insurance policies and how such laws affect the policies. Should these
actions resolve unfavorably, the estimated amount due from insurers of $93
million would require adjustment that could be material to the company’s results
of operations. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary
obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts
due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer
to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management
monitors the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing
basis.

The company is currently involved in
various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental
matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental
remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and
interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of
alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility.
Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit
requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment
systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental
contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not
material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental
remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws
and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates
estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by
environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with
these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential
costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup
sites. Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the
company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value.
This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the
risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that
of the environmental liability. The remaining discount of $8 million is being
accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30
years. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the company’s total environmental
liability was approximately $23 million and $20 million,
respectively.

Management believes that its
reserves for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the
company expects to incur. As a result, the company believes that the ultimate
liability with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the company may be subject to additional
remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing
laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies,
developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the
company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the
company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although
these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party
recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against
third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.

At December 31, 2009, the company
had reserved 66,487,601 unissued shares of its common stock for possible
issuance under stock-based compensation plans and for possible conversion of the
company’s convertible debentures.

The company has 50,000 shares of
authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.

The company has distributed rights
under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to
holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles
the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of
$200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until
the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a
person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii)
10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In the event that a person becomes
the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,
except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at
least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in
the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the
Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of
preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals
the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price
of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become
an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving
corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger
that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or
more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each
holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the
right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by
one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

As a result of the November 2006
merger with Fisher, warrants to purchase 1,653,585 shares of Fisher common stock

Fair
      Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial
  Instruments

Fair
Value Measurements

The company uses the market approach
technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in
valuation techniques during 2009. The company’s financial assets and liabilities
carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in money market
funds, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities, derivative contracts
used to hedge the company’s currency and interest rate risks and other
investments in unit trusts and insurance contracts held as assets to satisfy
outstanding retirement liabilities.

The fair value accounting guidance
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and
disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the
ability to access.

Level 2: Observable market based
inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as
quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable
data points that are not corroborated by market data.

information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009:

The cost of available-for-sale
investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining
realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. The
net gain on the sale of available-for-sale investments resulted from gross
realized gains of $0.1 million and $0.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively,
and gross realized losses of $1.0 million, $4.0 and $9.0 million in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

In addition to available-for-sale
investments, the company had $1.7 million and $0.8 million of trading
securities, consisting of debt and equity securities, at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

The company determines the fair
value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from
brokers/dealers. During 2009 and 2008, the company recorded in other expense,
net, $0.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of impairment charge on the
auction rate securities for declines in value deemed attributable to credit
losses exceeding six to nine months duration and thus considered
other-than-temporary. The following table is a rollforward of the fair value, as

inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation at
facilities closing due to real estate consolidation, charges to selling, general
and administrative expenses of $2.1 million for transaction costs related to the
B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition (Note 2) and $37.2 million of other costs, net. These
other costs consisted of $41.8 million of cash costs, primarily associated with
headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline
operations, including $31.4 million of severance for approximately 520 employees
primarily in manufacturing and sales and service functions; $5.5 million of
abandoned facility costs; and $4.9 million of other cash costs, primarily
retention, relocation and moving expenses associated with facility
consolidations as well as other costs associated with restructuring actions. The
segment also recorded $4.6 million of income, net, primarily due to a gain on
the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with
Fisher Scientific in 2006, offset partially by a $2.5 million charge for pension
termination benefits.

Laboratory Products and

The Laboratory Products and Services
segment recorded $23.1 million of net restructuring and other charges in 2009.
The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $2.0 million for the sale of
inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation at

certain pre-merger Fisher product

liability-related
matters partially offset by transaction costs related to the acquisition of
Biolab; $17.9 million in cash costs described below; and $3.8 million in other
costs, net. The cash costs, which were associated with headcount reductions and
facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, included $13.9
million of severance for approximately 370 employees primarily in manufacturing,
administrative, and sales and service functions; $1.1 million of abandoned
facility costs; and $2.9 million of other cash costs, primarily retention,
relocation, moving and related expenses associated with facility consolidations.
The non-cash costs of $3.8 million were related primarily to a loss on an
abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and, to a lesser
extent, the impairment of intangible and fixed assets related to a product
line.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
15.         Discontinued
Operations

In 2008, the
company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note
receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax
gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008.

Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition
of GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Competition Commission initiated an
investigation of the transaction and concluded that the acquisition would lead
to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in certain markets. The
Competition Commission further concluded that a divestiture remedy was
appropriate and required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its
principal product lines to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As
a result of this divestiture requirement, the company recorded after-tax
impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents
non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated
disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this
business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the
historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In
February 2008, the company completed the sale.

Aside from the impairment loss
related to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10
million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of
additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the
company’s estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested
business.
