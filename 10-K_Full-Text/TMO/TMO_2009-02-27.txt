New
Products and Research and Development

Our business includes the development
and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business
segments. We are not currently committed to any new products that require the
investment of a material amount of our funds, nor do we have any definitive
plans to enter new businesses that would require such an
investment.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we spent
$249 million, $239 million and $170 million, respectively, on research and
development, excluding a charge in 2008 of $3 million for in-process research
and development related to an acquisition and a charge in 2006 of $15 million
for in-process research and development at the date of the merger with
Fisher.

Raw
Materials

Our management team believes that we
have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant
products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining
the raw materials essential to our business. Raw-material and fuel prices are
subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies,
including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative
instruments, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our
results.

Patents,
Licenses and Trademarks

Patents are important in both segments
of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so
important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a
whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and
developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or
otherwise falling within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from
work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the
company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

We protect some of our technology as
trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks
used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with
others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.

Seasonal
Influences

Revenues in the fourth calendar quarter
are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending
patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers.

Working
Capital Requirements

There are no special inventory
requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material
adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency
on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of
which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in any of the past three
years.

Although the company transacts business
with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude
that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election
of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s
financial results.

Competition

The company encounters aggressive and
able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the
diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of
competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of
manufacturers and third-party distributors. In general, competitive climates in
the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer
demands that require continuing research and development. Our success in these
markets primarily depends on the following factors:

•

technical
      performance and advances in technology that result in new products and
      improved price/performance ratios;

•

product
      differentiation, availability and

Environmental
Matters

We are subject to various laws and
governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety
and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal
environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to
regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to
promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

Financial Statement Index



In addition to these federal
activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the
aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters
under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental
and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar
to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the
handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be
classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable
laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our
operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses.

Our expenses for environmental
requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical
remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these
compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our
expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and
operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial
measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New
Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984. Our Rockford,
Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency. We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these
sites. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially
responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields
Superfund Site. This site was listed in 1983 on the National Priority List under
CERCLA. Both New Jersey sites are also the subjects of CERCLA National Resources
Damages claims.

We record accruals for environmental
liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates
based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental
specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental
matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation,
remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities
for environmental matters totaled $20 million at December 31, 2008 and were not
material prior to the merger with Fisher. The liability for environmental
matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair
value and as such was discounted to its net present value.

These environmental liabilities do not
include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our
accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to
incur. As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to
environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to
additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in
existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement
policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of
our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Regulatory
Affairs

Our operations, and some of the
products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and
regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution
of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and
security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug
Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state
and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and
import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the
U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our
logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the
Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar
foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material r

espects
with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial
fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution
services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date,
none has had a material impact on our operations.

Financial Statement Index



We are subject to laws and regulations
governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and
regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have
agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a
result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to
investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government
contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension
of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or
debarment.

Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we
believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking
statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and
limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.

We must develop new products, adapt
to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of
new products in order to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes
significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our
products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant
technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and
enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of
new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely
become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and
operating results would suffer.

Financial Statement Index



It may be difficult for us to
implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the
markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several
years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve
our internal growth, including:

•

finding
      new markets for our products;

•

developing
      new applications for our
technologies;

•

combining
      sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more
      effectively;

•

allocating
      research and development funding to products with higher growth
      prospects;

•

continuing
      key customer initiatives;

•

expanding
      our service offerings;

•

strengthening
      our presence in selected geographic markets;
and

•

continuing
      the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and
      support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take
      advantage of our breadth in product
offerings.

We may not be able to successfully
implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of
our business.

Our business is impacted by general
economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we
operate. The current economic conditions including the credit crisis affecting
the financial markets and the global recession could adversely impact our
business in 2009 and beyond, resulting in:

•

reduced
      demand for some of our products;

•

increased
      rate of order cancellations or
delays;

•

increased
      risk of excess and obsolete
inventories;

•

increased
      pressure on the prices for our products and services;
  and

•

greater
      difficulty in collecting accounts
receivable.

Development of our products requires
significant investment; our products and technologies could become uncompetitive
or obsolete.

Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and
manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends
and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’
products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future
activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and
services that do not lead to significant revenue.

Many of our existing products and those
under development are technologically innovative and require significant
planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and
manufacturing-process levels. These activities require us to make significant
investments.

Financial Statement Index



Products in our markets undergo rapid
and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry
standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make
existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors
may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’
requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or
those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or
accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become
uncompetitive or obsolete.

Demand for most of our products
depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding
policies.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies,
laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public
and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy
spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a
significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These
policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our
products.

As a multinational corporation, we
are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely
affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International revenues
account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue
expanding our presence in international markets. In 2008, our international
revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United
States, accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues. The
exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange
rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S.
dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where
payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a
multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party
customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business
(the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the
functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of
operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our
international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial
reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our
international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2008, currency
translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of
$113 million due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies
in which the company sells products and services, but based on rates in effect
in early 2009, the impact of currency translation will be unfavorable in
2009.

Our inability to protect our
intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In
addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property,
and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a
result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade
secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes
because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products
through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in
part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent
protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We
own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional
applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not
be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to
us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently
broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us
may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these
patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors
may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual
property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries,
which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us
or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An
unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

Financial Statement Index



We also rely on trade secrets and
proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by
confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any
breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be
independently developed by our competitors.

Third parties may assert claims against
us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
For example, in September 2004 Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and
related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer
systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs. We could incur substantial
costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a
judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable
relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell,
distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against
us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that
relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual
property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the
patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or
other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our
products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in governmental regulations
may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete
in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state,
local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety
and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to
meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in
regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For
example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for
use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could
have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.

If any of our security products fail
to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and
related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.

The
products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive
range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace
explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo
facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection
and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction,
it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the
product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also
many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such
as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training
of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be
significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of
our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot
be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims
or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our inability to successfully
identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous
acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that
complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions
are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including
competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including
antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete
transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial
premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further,
we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our
existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated
cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could
adversely affect our business.

Financial Statement Index



Moreover, we have acquired many
companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded
significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance
sheet, which amount to approximately $8.68 and $1.33 billion, respectively, as
of December 31, 2008. We assess the realizability of the goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These
events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant
decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability
to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will
depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn
depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not
able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment
of those assets.

Our growth strategy to acquire new
businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may
be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations.

We have retained contingent
liabilities from businesses that we have sold.

From 1997 through 2004, we
divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2
billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of
the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits,
product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that
representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The
resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain
that this favorable pattern will continue.

We are subject to laws and
regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws
and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.

We
have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and,
as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government
contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government
contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to
private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the
regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these
regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and
administrative penalties or debarment.

Because we compete directly with
certain of our largest customers and product suppliers, our results of
operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or
suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with
us.

Our largest customer

in the laboratory
consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are
also significant competitors. Our business may be harmed in the short term if
our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in
a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture
products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party
suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our
business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large
third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.

Because we rely heavily on
third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these
services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship
products, increase our costs and lower our profitability

.

We ship a significant portion of our
products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such
as UPS and Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a
small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our
products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms,
overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If UPS or another
third-party package-delivery provider experiences a major work stoppage,
preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us
to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our
costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could
be adversely affected. In addition, if UPS or our other third-party
package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to find
comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our
profitability could be adversely affected.

Financial Statement Index



We are subject to regulation by various
federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide
variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of products,
the shipping of our products and environmental matters.

Some of our operations are subject to
regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international
agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from
design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and
distribution. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s
regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall
products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our
costs and reduce our revenues.

We are subject to federal, state, local
and international laws and regulations that govern the handling, transportation,
manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic
or hazardous substances. Some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our
operations and the products we manufacture, sell or distribute. This requires us
to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations, including the establishment of reserves to
address potential environmental costs, and manage environmental
risks.

We rely heavily on manufacturing
operations to produce the products we sell, and our business could be adversely
affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations.

We rely upon our manufacturing
operations to produce many of the products we sell. Any significant disruption
of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power
interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could
adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely
affect our business. Although most of our raw materials are available from a
number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to
obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the
materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain
of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a
marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

We may be unable to adjust to rapid
changes in the healthcare industry, some of which could adversely affect our
business.

The healthcare industry has undergone
significant changes in an effort to reduce costs. These changes
include:

•

development
      of large and sophisticated groups purchasing medical and surgical
      supplies;

•

wider
      implementation of managed care;

•

legislative
      healthcare reform;

•

consolidation
      of pharmaceutical companies;

•

increased
      outsourcing of certain activities, including to low-cost offshore
      locations; and

•

consolidation
      of distributors of pharmaceutical, medical and surgical
      supplies.

We expect the healthcare industry to
continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes,
such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse
changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of
healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry
participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the
prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.

Financial Statement Index



Fluctuations in our

effective tax rate may adversely
affect our business

,

results of operations

and cash
flows.

As a global company, we are subject to
taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our
financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable
in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than
experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix
of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income
taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in
which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective
tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current
expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and cash flows.

We may incur
unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could
reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Our primary commodity exposures are for
fuel, petroleum-based resins, steel and serum. While we may seek to minimize the
impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various
cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in
the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.

Unforeseen problems with the
implementation and maintenance of our information systems at certain of our
sites could interfere with our operations.

As a part of the effort to
upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise
resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of
our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could
arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our
ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes, take customer
orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and
track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our
business. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased
visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or
maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations and cash
flows could be adversely affected.

Our debt may adversely affect our cash
flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our
activities.

As of December 31, 2008, we had
approximately $2.06 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the
ability to incur an additional $950 million of indebtedness under our revolving
credit facility. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of
credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing
our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative
consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and
industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and
limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic
acquisitions.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations
depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial,
competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate
sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations. If we are unable to service our
debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic
acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. We
may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at
all.

Additionally, the agreements governing
our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain
affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other
limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make
investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with
affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a
debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any
lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is
outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the
facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the
facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated
Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to
be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.

Financial Statement Index



Our ability to comply with these
financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance,
which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including
factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may
result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could
permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay
that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under
one of our debt instruments

would trigger an event
of default under other of our debt instruments.

Legal Proceedings

On September 3, 2004, Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and
Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments filed a complaint against the
company in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Civil Action No.
04-1230-GMS. These plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer
systems, including its triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems,
infringe U.S. patent number 4,963,736 entitled “Mass Spectrometer and Method and
Improved

Ion Transmission.” The plaintiffs
seek damages, including treble damages for alleged willful infringement,
attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive relief. An unfavorable
outcome could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

On December 8, 2004 and February 23,
2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits in the same Delaware court, that one
or more of the plaintiffs in the above action infringe two patents of the
company (U.S. patent number 5,385,654 entitled “Controlled Temperature Anion
Separation by Capillary Electrophoresis” and U.S. patent number 6,528,784
entitled “Mass Spectrometer System Including a Double Ion Guide Interface and
Method of Operation”). The lawsuits brought by the company seek relief similar
to that being sought by the plaintiffs.

Our business involves a risk of product
liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business. We are a party to
various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including consolidated multi-party
product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as
well as through acquisitions. We believe that some of the costs incurred in
defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury
and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by
certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or
purchasers. Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers
that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become
material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related
factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Actual
costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree
of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating
these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally
liable. See “Item 1 — Business — Environmental Matters,” for
legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.

We are subject to the jurisdiction of
various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the Agency for International Development. Various
governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine
matters relating to our operations. Some operations involve and have involved
the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as
toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental
laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in
particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in
similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or
be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the
future.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations

Reference is made throughout this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page
F-1 of this report.

Thermo Electron Corporation and
Fisher Scientific International Inc. completed a merger of the two companies on
November 9, 2006 in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses
are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research
community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of
products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture
media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products
and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005.
Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from
November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc. To assist in year over year comparisons, certain information in
the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been
presented on a pro forma basis, as if the two companies had been combined from
the beginning of 2006.

Overview
of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The company develops, manufactures and
sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the
product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own
core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary
businesses. Following the merger with Fisher, the company’s continuing
operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies
and Laboratory Products and Services. During the first quarter of 2008, the
company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting
and monitoring for several small product lines between segments. The company has
historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic
focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product
line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been
reported. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect
these transfers. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than
in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical
and government customers.

Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion, an
increase of $752 million from 2007. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and
divestitures and currency translation (discussed in total and by segment below),
revenues increased over 2007 revenues by $453 million due to higher revenues at
existing businesses as a result of increased demand, discussed below, and, to a
lesser extent, price increases.

The company’s strategy is to augment
internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as
those completed in the past two years. The principal acquisitions included
La-Pha-Pack, a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and
related accessories in December 2007; Priority Solutions International, a
third-party logistics provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries
in October 2007; NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a supplier of micro UV-Vis
spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in October 2007 and
Qualigens Fine Chemicals, an India-based chemical manufacturer and supplier in
September 2007.

Financial Statement Index



In 2008, operating income and operating
income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $974
million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating income was
due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental
revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and productivity
improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following
restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of lower cost
of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of lower
restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment gain in
2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were offset in
part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of
acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008
acquisitions.

The company’s effective tax rate was
14.0% and 11.5% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was
favorably affected by $28 million or 2.4 percentage points resulting from the
impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax
rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the
impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in
income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably
affected by $32 million or 3.6 percentage points resulting from enacted
reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on
the company’s deferred tax balances.

Income from continuing operations
increased to $989 million in 2008 from $780 million in 2007, primarily due to
the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2008 offset in part
by the higher tax rate in 2008.

During 2008, the company’s cash flow
from operations totaled $1.42 billion, compared with $1.48 billion for 2007. The
decrease resulted from higher payments for income taxes and an increased
investment in working capital items offset in part by improved cash flow at
existing businesses. Cash flow from operations in 2007 was net of $78 million in
merger-related operating cash outflows, including severance and retirement
benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid
subsequent to 2006.

As of December 31, 2008, the company’s
outstanding debt totaled $2.06 billion, of which approximately $969 million is
convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per
share. As of February 27, 2009, $295 million of the convertible debt was
currently convertible. Although the company’s experience is that convertible
debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity
date, it is possible, particularly in the current uncertain financial climate,
that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example,
a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market
for the common stock. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is
required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and
the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's
election. Should holders elect to convert or exercise their put rights, the
company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund substantially
all of these principal payments. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit
agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $950 million at
December 31, 2008.

The company believes that its existing
cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2008, and
the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing
capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash
requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least
the next 24 months.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and
analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis,
management evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity
investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations,
intangible assets, warranty obligations,

Financial Statement Index



income
taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation,
restructuring and sale of businesses. Management believes the most complex and
sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial
statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these
estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

The company believes the following
represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation
of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts
      Receivable

The
      company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such
      allowances totaled $43 million at December 31, 2008. The company estimates
      the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age
      of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other
      information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition
      of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to
      make payments, additional allowances would be
  required.

(b)

Inventories

The
      company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for
      differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking
      into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and
      any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage
      or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional
      writedowns may be required.

(c)

Intangible Assets and
      Goodwill

The
      company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of
      assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A
      significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s
      acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of
      significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such
      intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the
      period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The
      company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets
      principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from
      identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash
      flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the
      dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.10 billion
      at December 31, 2008. The company reviews other intangible assets for
      impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a
      significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual
      cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from
      projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from
      those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in
      impairment of such asset.

The
      company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
      impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may
      reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or
      circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected
      adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological
      changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by
      governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
      totaled $8.68 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31,
      2008. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to
      revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working
      capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in
      the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and
      the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
      assets for impairment.

Financial Statement Index



The
      company’s market capitalization decreased from September 2008 to
      approximately book value in the three business days before and after
      year-end. Management believes that the decrease occurred primarily due to
      economic uncertainty affecting the broader financial markets and concern
      about companies’ ability to reach their financial goals. The company’s
      businesses, however, were not materially adversely affected by the
      significant global downturn during 2008. Projections of profitability for
      2009 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and
      earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment
      of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December 31,
      2008. There can be no assurance, however, that further deterioration of
      the financial markets will not materially adversely affect peer trading
      multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their
      forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair
      value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets
      decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or
      other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount
      rate, charges for impairment may be
necessary.

(d)

Other Long-Lived
      Assets

The
      company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of
      potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows
      associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.64 billion
      at December 31, 2008, including $1.28 billion of fixed assets. In testing
      a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning
      projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash
      flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth
      and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed
      for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from
      estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may
      be necessary.

(e)

Revenues

In
      instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation
      obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the
      equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the
      installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue
      between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value
      at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the
      installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.
      If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for
      all elements is deferred until delivery is
  completed.

In
      instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified
      acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate
      adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s

acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the
      nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in
      complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the
      company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of
      its products until completion of customer acceptance
    testing.

The
      company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products
      and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license
      revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been
      delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value
      exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available
      for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until
      delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support
      contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
      contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is
      determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when
      sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are
      recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined
      by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold
      separately.

The
      company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by
      customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned,
      additional adjustments to revenue may be
  required.

Financial Statement Index



(f)

Warranty
      Obligations

At
      the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated
      cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and
      knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected
      warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for
      warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $44
      million at December 31, 2008. Should product failure rates or the actual
      cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the
      estimated warranty liability would be
necessary.

(g)

Income
      Taxes

In the ordinary course of business there is
      inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions.
      The company assesses income tax positions and records

tax
      benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s
      evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the
      reporting date. For those tax

positions
      where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the
      company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than
      50 percent

likelihood
      of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that
      has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax
      positions where it is not

more
      likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has
      been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated
      interest expense has also

been
      recognized.

The
      company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a
      result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S.
      tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these
      governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires
      the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of
      estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the
      amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue
      recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of
      income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and
      treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of
      operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an
      impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the
      company’s net income.

The
      company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards
      will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax
      jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss
      carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it
      becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be
      used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Following the
      adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) in 2009, any such reversals will be recorded
      as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation
      allowance totaled $161 million at December 31, 2008. Should the company’s
      actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates,
      additional allowances or reversals thereof may be
    necessary.

The
      company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the
      worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes
      totaled $33 million at December 31, 2008. Should tax return positions that
      the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the
      company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such
      taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be
      sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would
      result.

Contingencies and
      Litigation

The
      company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal
      proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and
      auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of
      business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical
      claims experience, the

probability
      of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal
      and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher
      as of the merger date, including environmental reserves, were initially
      recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net
      present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from
      third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be
      probable.

Pension and Other Retiree
      Benefits

Several
      of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit
      pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these
      arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the
      benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot
      be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major
      assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans
      include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of
      increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based
      on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with
      third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’
      measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and
      other postretirement benefit plans totaled income of $7 million in 2008,
      including $19 million of income from curtailment of pension plans. The
      company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $303 million at year-end
      2008 compared with $170 million at year-end 2007. Should any of these
      assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension
      costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in
      the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other
      postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase
      in the benefit obligation of approximately $82
  million.

The
      decrease in the funded status in 2008 resulted primarily from a downturn
      that affected financial markets. The company expects to contribute $20 to
      $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in
  2009.

(j)

Stock-based
      Compensation

The
      fair value of each stock option granted by the company is
      estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation
      model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to
      selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility
      based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock.
      The expected lives of grants through 2007 were estimated using the
      simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107.
      Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for
      determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is
      based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which
      approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes
      in these input variables would affect the amount of expense
      associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation
      expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated
      forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based
      on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual
      forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to
      compensation expense may be
required.

(k)

Restructuring
      Costs

The
      company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities
      based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The
      company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in
      continuing operations totaled $6 million at December 31, 2008. Should
      actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated
      facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be
      required.

Financial Statement Index



(l)

Assets Held for
      Sale

The
      company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and,
      when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these
      assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated
      proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments,
      vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected
      amounts.

Results
of Operations

2008 Compared With

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion, an
increase of $752 million from 2007. The favorable effects of currency
translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $113 million in 2008. Sales
increased $186 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the
effect of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues
increased $453 million primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser
extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was very strong
in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe although in the fourth
quarter of 2008, growth slowed in Asia and improved in Europe. Although the
company did not experience a material adverse impact on its revenues or
profitability in 2008 as a result of the current business environment, no
assurances can be given that these poor economic conditions will not continue in
2009 or beyond, and cause certain customers to delay or cancel orders for the
company’s products or services.

In the latter part of 2008, the U.S.
dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells
product and services. Strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the
amount of revenues the company reported in U.S. dollars of approximately 4% in
the fourth quarter of 2008. Were the currency exchange rates in effect in early
2009, to remain during 2009, translation would negatively affect revenues in
2009 by approximately 4%. The lower revenues would unfavorably affect earnings
per share by approximately $.15.

In 2008, operating income and operating
income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $974
million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating income was
due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental
revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and productivity
improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following
restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of lower cost
of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of lower
restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment gain in
2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were offset in
part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of
acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008
acquisitions.

Restructuring and other costs were
recorded during 2008 and 2007. In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and
other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of
revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition
and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to
facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs
primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to
economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned
facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The
company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of
acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit
acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter
assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of
businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an
acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the
curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. (Note 14). In 2007, the
company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including
$49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the
sale of inventories revalued at the date of

Financial Statement Index



acquisition
(principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily
for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses
that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on
sale of a small business unit. As of February 27, 2009, the company has
identified actions totaling approximately $7 million that will be undertaken in
2009 and expects to identify additional actions during 2009. The restructuring
actions initiated in 2008 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the
second half of 2008 and early 2009 of approximately $34 million, including $26
million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $8 million in the Laboratory
Products and Services segment.

The company’s management evaluates
segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to
cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting;
restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility
consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and
losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of
stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this
measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core
operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining
compensation (Note 3).

Income from the company’s reportable
segments increased 14% to $1.87 billion in 2008 due primarily to higher
profitability at existing businesses, resulting from incremental revenues
including price increases and productivity improvements including global
sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. This
improvement was offset in part by higher commodity prices.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies
segment increased $290 million to $4.47 billion in 2008. The favorable effects
of currency translation resulted in an increase of $74 million in 2008. Sales
increased $42 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to
the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net
of divestitures, revenues increased $174 million primarily due to higher demand
and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. The higher demand was due, in part,
to the introduction of new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of
scientific instruments and specialty diagnostics. Sales growth slowed in the
latter part of 2008 due to lower fourth quarter sales of environmental
monitoring equipment and process instruments which were unfavorably affected by
a downturn in industrial markets.

Operating income margin was 21.4% in
2008 and 19.7% in 2007. The increase resulted from profit on incremental
revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring
actions.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and
Services segment increased $542 million to $6.45 billion in 2008. The favorable
effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $39 million in 2008.
Sales increased $163 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In
addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and
acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $340 million primarily due
to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Sales made through
the segment’s research market and healthcare market channels and revenues from
the company’s biopharma services were particularly strong. These increases in
revenue were offset in part by lower sales in early 2008 made through the
segment’s safety market channel. The safety market channel sales are in part
dependent on expenditures for homeland security that vary based on government
spending priorities.

In July 2008, the company and a
supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two
years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company expects its sales
volume in 2009 of products purchased from the supplier to decrease by
approximately $60 million from 2008.

Operating income margin increased to
14.1% in 2008 from 13.7% in 2007, primarily due to profit on incremental revenue
and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring
actions, offset in part by the impact of inflation on commodities such as raw
resin, steel and plastics as well as higher fuel and freight costs.

Other
Expense, Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $80 million and $93 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively (Note 4).
Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on
investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other
items, net. The decrease was primarily due to $10 million of lower interest
expense as a result of reduced market rates on variable rate debt and redemption
of $129 million of long-term debt due in October 2008. See discussion below
concerning a recent accounting pronouncement that will increase non-cash
interest expense in 2009.

Financial Statement Index



Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rate was
14.0% and 11.5% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was
favorably affected by $28 million or 2.4 percentage points resulting from the
impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax
rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the
impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in
income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably
affected by $32 million or 3.6 percentage points resulting from enacted
reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on
the company’s deferred tax balances.

Contingent
Liabilities

At year-end 2008, the company was
contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related
matters. See “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10. An unfavorable
outcome in one or more of the matters described therein could materially affect
the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash
flows.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 was effective for
the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and
for non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009 (Note 12).
The company does not believe the impact of adopting the fair value guidance
outlined in SFAS No. 157 to its non-financial assets and liabilities will have a
material impact on its financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No.
159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities
and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an
instrument-by-instrument basis. The company adopted SFAS No. 159 beginning
January 1, 2008. Adoption of the standard did not result in any change in the
valuation of the company’s assets and liabilities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R does the following: requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain
information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as
transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense
instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price
will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes
through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company,
on a prospective basis, beginning January 1, 2009. The company expects no
material effect at the adoption date; however, upon adoption, this statement may
materially affect the accounting for any future business
combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS
No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be
reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The
company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this
standard.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.
161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No.
161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
how derivative

instruments
and related hedged items are accounted for; and how derivative instruments and
related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for the company beginning
January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of
this standard.

Financial Statement Index



In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB
No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” FSP APB No. 14-1
requires the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled
in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability
(debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the
issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in
subsequent periods. FSP ABP No. 14-1 is effective for the company beginning
January 1, 2009. Prior periods will be restated as if the new rule had been in
effect in those periods. Early adoption is not permitted. While the company’s
cash payments for interest will not be affected, based on current debt
outstanding, the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 will increase the company’s
reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar
non-convertible debt. The company expects that annual interest expense will
increase by approximately $23 million, which will unfavorably affect earnings
per share by approximately $.03 per year following adoption of the
rule.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF
03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable
dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. As
participating securities, these instruments should be included in the
calculation of basic earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for the
company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect
from adoption of this rule.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.”
FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets
of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands
current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to
include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets similar
to the company’s current SFAS No. 157 disclosures. FSP No. 132(R)-1 is effective
for the company beginning in January 2009.

Discontinued
Operations

During 2008, the company recorded
additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related
to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million.
The note was collected in July 2008.

In 2007, the company recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of $29 million on a business held for sale and
subsequently sold. The loss primarily represented the carrying value of the
business in excess of the estimated disposal value. Aside from the impairment
loss, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued
operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a
business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from
litigation related to a divested business.

2007 Compared With

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an
increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the
merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent,
increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger
with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876
million (10%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $128
million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures,
b) $241 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $507
million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased
demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong
in Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and more moderate in
Europe.

Financial Statement Index



In 2007, operating income and operating
income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242
million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. The increase in operating income was
due to the inclusion of the Fisher businesses for a full year in 2007, $125
million of pre-tax charges associated with the Fisher merger incurred in 2006
and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting
from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements. These
increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as
a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and
other acquisitions.

Restructuring and other costs were
recorded during 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs in 2007 primarily included
merger-related exit costs at existing businesses. The cost of actions at Fisher
businesses was charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions
at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher was charged to restructuring
expense. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of
$91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially
all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition
(principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily
for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that
have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of
a small business unit. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in
annual cost savings of approximately $11 million, primarily in the Analytical
Technologies segment. In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other
costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of
revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of
acquisition (principally Fisher) and $30 million of cash costs, primarily for
severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have
been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for
in-process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. The company
substantially finalized its plan for restructuring actions at Fisher or within
existing businesses with which Fisher was being integrated by the end of 2007.
Such actions included rationalization of product lines, consolidation of
facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The restructuring actions
initiated in 2006 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $11 million,
including $6 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $5 million in
the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies
segment increased $1.81 billion to $4.18 billion in 2007 primarily due to the
merger with Fisher and other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased
revenues at existing businesses and favorable currency translation. Had the
Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $507
million (14%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $103
million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures,
b) $133 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $271
million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased
demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The increase in demand was from
life science and industrial customers due in part to strong market response to
new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of scientific instruments
as well as environmental monitoring equipment and, to a lesser extent, process
instruments and specialty diagnostic tools.

Operating income margin was 19.7% in
2007 and 15.6% in 2006. The increase resulted from profit on incremental
revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had the
merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would
have been 17.1% in 2006.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and
Services segment increased $4.45 billion to $5.91 billion in 2007, primarily due
to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions. Had the Fisher merger occurred
on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $407 million (7%) over pro
forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $30 million due to acquisitions
made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $109 million due to the
favorable effect of currency translation and c) $268 million due to increased
revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser
extent, higher prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market channel,
which includes the Fisher catalog, and revenues from the company’s biopharma
outsourcing offerings were strong.

Operating income margin decreased to
13.7% in 2007 from 13.8% in 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of Fisher
revenues, which have a slightly lower operating margin than the company’s legacy
laboratory equipment business offset in part by price increases and productivity
improvements, including restructuring actions. Had the merger with Fisher
occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 12.3% in
2006.

Other
Expense, Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $93 million and $33 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest
income increased to $47 million in 2007 from $16 million in the same period of
2006, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow
and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates. Interest expense
increased to $140 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006, primarily as a
result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher.

Financial Statement Index



Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rate was
11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was
favorably affected by a one-time benefit of $32 million, or 3.6 percentage
points, discussed below. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in
the effective tax rate in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to
geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States
due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with
the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax
credit for qualifying U.S. research costs, growth in lower tax regions such as
Asia and, to a lesser extent, a tax gain in excess of the related book gain on
the sale of a product line in 2006.

In 2007, the United Kingdom enacted new
tax legislation that became effective on April 1, 2008, lowering its corporate
tax rate. Denmark, Canada and Germany also enacted new tax legislation, with
various effective dates, that reduced the corporate tax rate. As a result of
these changes in tax rates, the deferred tax balances of all the company’s
entities in these countries were adjusted to reflect the new tax rates in
2007.

Discontinued
Operations

Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of
GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Competition Commission initiated an
investigation of the transaction and concluded that the acquisition would lead
to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in certain markets. The
Competition Commission further concluded that a divestiture remedy was
appropriate and required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its
principal product lines to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As
a result of this divestiture requirement, the company recorded after-tax
impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents
non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated
disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this
business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the
historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In
February 2008, the company completed the sale.

Aside from the impairment loss related
to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in
2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional
proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s
estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business.

The company had after-tax gains of $2
million in 2006 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The gains
represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004,
net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a
divested business.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was
$2.81 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.76 billion at December 31,
2007. The increase was primarily due to increases in cash and, to a lesser
extent, a decrease in current liabilities including accounts payable and accrued
expenses and current maturities of long-term debt. Included in working capital
were cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of
$1.29 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $639 million at December 31,
2007.


Cash provided by operating activities
was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million
of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in accounts
receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million,
respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth
in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292
million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no
longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring
actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate
consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008.

Financial Statement Index



During 2008, the company’s primary
investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant
and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264
million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.

The company’s financing activities used
$228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million
of the company’s common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in
part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85
million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax
benefits from the exercise of stock options. On September 11, 2008, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company’s
common stock through September 10, 2009. At December 31, 2008, $415 million was
available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this
authorization.

The company has no material commitments
for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2009,
such expenditures will approximate $230 - $250 million.

As of December 31, 2008, the company’s
outstanding debt totaled $2.06 billion, of which approximately $969 million is
convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per
share. As of February 27, 2009, $295 million of the convertible debt was
currently convertible. Although the company’s experience is that convertible
debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity
date, it is possible, particularly in the current uncertain financial climate,
that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example,
a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market
for the common stock. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is
required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and
the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's
election. Should holders elect to convert, the company intends to draw on its
revolving credit facility to fund substantially all of these principal payments.
The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in
2012 with available capacity of $950 million at December 31,
2008.

The company believes that its
existing cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion as of December 31,
2008, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available
borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet
the cash requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future, including at
least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating activities
was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds,
totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S.
estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for
merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards.
The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced
operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing
operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate
consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007.

During 2007, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations were acquisitions and the
purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on
acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48
million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19
million, principally real estate. The company’s discontinued operations provided
cash of $31 million from investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac
Limited.

The company’s financing activities used
$929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million
of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the company’s common
stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had
proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97
million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.

Financial Statement Index




Cash provided by operating activities
was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing
operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $80 million,
primarily as a result of merger-related payments made following completion of
the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and
retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher, offset in part by
an increase in other accrued expenses. Cash of $32 million was provided by
collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the
company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other
expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during
2006.

During 2006, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale
investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant
and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with
Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132
million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and
equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a
Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher
executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of
product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued
operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional
proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004.

The company’s financing activities used
$260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million
of the company’s common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset
in part by short-term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The
company increased short-term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had
proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17
million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special purpose
entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2006 - 2008 except
for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees
disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for
letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3
million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally
in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees
of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of
business.

Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits

predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.

The company has no material commitments
for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2009, such
expenditures for its existing business will approximate $230 - $250
million.

In disposing of assets or businesses,
the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to
cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets,
environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to
investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the
disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential
liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of
operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities
for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See
Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these
liabilities.

Item
      7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
      Risk

The company is exposed to market risk
from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which
could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The
company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and
financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward
contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into
forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments
denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The
company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the
purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s
local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts
principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British
pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Danish krone and Australian dollars. Income
and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses
and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does
not enter into speculative currency agreements.

Interest
Rates

The company is exposed to changes in
interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of
ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as
well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2008, the company’s debt
portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The fair market value of the company’s long-term fixed interest rate debt is
subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed
interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s long-term debt at
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was $2.131 billion and $3.004 billion,
respectively. Fair values were determined from available market prices using
current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease
by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s long-term debt at December
31, 2008 would increase by approximately $52 million. In 2007, a 100 basis point
decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s
debt by approximately $61 million.

In addition, interest rate changes
would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate
debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31,
2008 and 2007, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by
$3.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

Currency
Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in
international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s
reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international
subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The
functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are
principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The
effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in
international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive
items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2008
and 2007 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a
reduction of shareholders’ equity of $306 million and $297 million,
respectively.

The fair value of forward
currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount
that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking
into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in
year-end 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates related to the company’s
contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward
currency-exchange contracts of $24 million and $22 million, respectively. The
unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses
or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Financial Statement Index



Certain of the company’s cash and cash
equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of
the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10%
depreciation in the related year-end 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates
applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $8 million
and $26 million, respectively, on the company’s net income.

Equity
Prices

The company’s available-for-sale
investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to
fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are
sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in
equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s
available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference
between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or
issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2008 and 2007
market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible
obligations by $81 million and $180 million, respectively.

Management’s
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the
participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
December 31, 2008. Based on this evaluation, the company’s chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the
company’s disclosure controls and

procedures
were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, reported and accumulated and
communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the
company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on criteria established
in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008,
the company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To

the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2008 and December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008

in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, the financial statement schedule and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

As
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

THERMO

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
      1.

Nature
      of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Nature
of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the
company, formerly Thermo Electron Corporation) enables customers to make the
world healthier, cleaner and safer. The company offers customers a complete
range of high-end analytical instruments, software, services, consumables and
reagents to enable integrated laboratory workflow solutions and a complete
portfolio of laboratory equipment, chemicals, supplies and services used in
healthcare, scientific research, safety and education. Markets served include
pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs,
universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well as
environmental and industrial process control settings.

Principles
of Consolidation

On November 9, 2006, the company
completed a merger with Fisher Scientific International Inc. (Fisher). Fisher’s
accounts and results are included in the accompanying financial statements from
that date (Note 2). The accompanying financial statements include the accounts
of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company
accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50%
using the equity method.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all
significant obligations have been met, collectibility is probable and title has
passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of
services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes
revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company
recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple
deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered
or completed based upon its relative fair value. If fair value is not available
for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery
is completed. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until
installation or acceptance, the company defers that portion of the revenue until
completion of installation or acceptance has been obtained. Provisions for
discounts, warranties, rebates to customers, returns and other adjustments are
provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.

The company recognizes revenue from the
sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual
licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the
license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and
collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often include
multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support. The
company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after all
elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE)
of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not
available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred
until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support
contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract,
which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software
maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the
maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and
consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE,
which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services
are sold separately.

Service revenues represent the
company’s service offerings including biopharma outsourcing, asset management,
diagnostic testing, training, extended service contracts, and field service
including related time and materials. Service revenues are recognized as the
service is performed. Revenues for extended service contracts are recognized
ratably over the contract period.

Accounts receivable are recorded at
the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on historical
write-off experience. Past due balances are reviewed individually for
collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the
company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The
company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to
customers.

The company records shipping and
handling charges billed to customers in net sales and records shipping and
handling costs in cost of goods sold for all periods presented.

Deferred revenue in the accompanying
balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue on service contracts, which
is recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. Substantially all of the
deferred revenue in the accompanying 2008 balance sheet will be recognized
within one year.

Warranty
Obligations

The company provides for the estimated
cost of product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of
revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring
and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material
usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and
supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product
failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties
is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The

Income
Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” the company recognizes deferred income taxes
based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the
financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities,
calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

In accordance with FIN 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” the
financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax
positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return
presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all
relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note
6).

Earnings
per Share

Basic earnings per share has been
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to
income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed
in 2006 assuming the conversion of the company’s 3.25% Subordinated Convertible
Debentures and the elimination of the related interest expense, and for all
periods using the treasury stock method for the remaining convertible
obligations, warrants and the exercise of stock options, as well as their
related income tax effects (Note 7). Substantially all of the company’s 3.25%
Subordinated Convertible Debentures were converted to common stock in December
2006 and the remainder was redeemed in early January 2007.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists
principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable
securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These
investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and
debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered
short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. Such securities
principally represent available-for-sale investments. In addition, the company
owns marketable equity securities that represent less than 20% ownership and for
which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such
investments are also considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale
securities are carried at market value, with the difference between cost and
market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other
comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 8 and 12).
Decreases in market values of individual securities below cost for a duration of
six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary impairment, and
the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount of the
investments to market value through other expense, net, in the accompanying
statement of income (Note 4).

Other investments for which there
are not readily determinable market values are accounted for under the cost
method of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which
provides that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the company had cost method investments
with carrying amounts of $10.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, which are
included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of
inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each
product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is
subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value
of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company
records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying
value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the
procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and
receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues
in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as
follows:

2007, respectively, which approximated estimated replacement cost.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides
for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements,
25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold
improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and only the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property,
plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related
Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets
include the costs of acquired product technology, patents, tradenames and other
specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20
years. In addition, the company has tradenames that it acquired in the merger
with Fisher that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company
reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential
impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with
the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be
impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Other
Assets

Other assets in the accompanying
balance sheet include deferred tax assets, insurance recovery receivables
related to product liability matters, notes receivable, cash surrender value of
life insurance, deferred debt expense, capitalized catalog costs, cost-method
investments, investments in joint ventures and other assets.

In May and July 2007, the company
contributed businesses with annualized third-party revenues and net assets of
$43 million and $101 million, respectively, to newly formed joint ventures with
third parties. The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s
capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint
venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and
disposable laboratory glass products. The company owns 49% - 50% of the joint
ventures and, following the formation of these entities, no longer consolidates
the results of the subsidiaries that were contributed but instead records its
pro rata share of the joint ventures’ results in other expense, net, in the
accompanying statement of income, using the equity method of accounting. The
results of the joint ventures were not material from their formation through
December 31, 2008. The company made purchases of products for resale from the
glass products joint venture totaling $47.2 million and $20.9 million in 2008
and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability
of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it
may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence
of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or
more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of
its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer
market multiples. When an impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value
over fair value of goodwill is recorded as an operating loss.

The company completed annual tests
for impairment at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and determined that goodwill was
not impaired. The company used an income approach and peer market multiples
approach to determine the fair value of its reporting units.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

The company records obligations
associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FIN 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation of SFAS No. 143.” The
company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition,
construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined
that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is
conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset
retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability
is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional
carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference
between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted
over the life of the related lease as interest expense. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations of $23.9 million and
$31.3 million, respectively.

Accounts
Payable

The company, in accordance with FIN
39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,” reclassifies net book
overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Amounts reclassified to accounts
payable totaled $24.5 million and $83.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Loss
Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various
contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’
compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other
claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on
management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses
and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external
legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records
receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery
has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in the merger with
Fisher have been recorded at their fair value and, as such, were discounted to
their present value at the date of acquisition.

Advertising

The company expenses advertising
costs as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of
future benefit, generally two years. The company has capitalized advertising
costs of $13.4 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing
costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed.
Advertising expense, which following the merger with Fisher includes
amortization of capitalized direct-response advertising, as described above, was
$78.5 million, $76.0 million and $57.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Included in advertising expense was catalog amortization of $13.1
million, $12.7 million and $2.0 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Currency
Translation

All assets and liabilities of the
company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year in
accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” Resulting
translation adjustments are reflected in the “Accumulated other comprehensive
items” component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction gains and losses
are included in the accompanying statement of income and are not material for
the three years presented.

Forward
Contracts

The company accounts for forward
currency contracts under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all
derivatives, including forward currency-exchange contracts, be recognized in the
balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges, as defined by SFAS
No. 133, are recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings.

The company uses forward
currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational (cash-flow
hedges) and balance sheet (fair-value hedges) exposures resulting from changes
in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and
intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional
currencies of the respective operations. These contracts principally hedge
transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling,
Canadian dollars, Danish krone and Australian dollars. The company enters into
these currency-exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases and
sales and assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business,
principally accounts receivable and intercompany loans. Accordingly, the hedges
are not speculative in nature. As part of

the
company’s overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of
currency-exchange fluctuations, some operating units hedge a portion of their
currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing 12-month period, using exchange
contracts that have maturities of 12 months or less. The company does not hold
or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other
than risk management. The company has elected not to account for its
forward-currency exchange contracts as hedges as defined by SFAS No. 133, thus
these derivatives are recorded at fair value in its balance sheet in other
current assets or other accrued expenses with the changes in fair value
reflected immediately in earnings.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 was effective for
the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and
for non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009 (Note 12).
The company does not believe the impact of adopting the fair value guidance
outlined in SFAS No. 157 to its non-financial assets and liabilities will have a
material impact on its financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No.
159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities
and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an
instrument-by-instrument basis. The company adopted SFAS No. 159 beginning
January 1, 2008. Adoption of the standard did not result in any change in the
valuation of the company’s assets and liabilities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R does the following: requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain
information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as
transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense
instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price
will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes
through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company,
on a prospective basis, beginning January 1, 2009. The company expects no
material effect at the adoption date; however, upon adoption, this statement may
materially affect the accounting for any future business
combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS
No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be
reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The
company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this
standard.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.
161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No.
161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and how
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for
the company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material
effect from adoption of this standard.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB
No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” FSP APB No. 14-1
requires the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled
in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account

for the
liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that
reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is
recognized in subsequent periods. FSP ABP No. 14-1 is effective for the company
beginning January 1, 2009. Prior periods will be restated as if the new rule had
been in effect in prior periods. Early adoption is not permitted. While the
company’s cash payments for interest will not be affected, based on current debt
outstanding, the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 will increase the company’s
reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar
non-convertible debt. The company expects that annual interest expense will
increase by approximately $23 million, which will unfavorably affect earnings
per share by approximately $.03 per year following adoption of the
rule.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF
03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that
share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable
dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. As
participating securities, these instruments should be included in the
calculation of basic earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for the
company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect
from adoption of this rule.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.”
FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets
of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands
current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to
include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets similar
to the company’s current SFAS No. 157 disclosures. FSP No. 132(R)-1 is effective
for the company beginning in January 2009.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating
future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets, and in determining the
ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14).
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Acquisitions

In September 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a
division of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. based in Mumbai, India.
Qualigens is India’s largest chemical manufacturer and supplier, serving
customers in a variety of industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical and
food and beverage. The purchase price totaled $59 million. The acquisition
provided an established business in a fast-growing region to extend the
company’s reach. Revenues of Qualigens totaled $24 million in 2006. The purchase
price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $25
million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In October 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Priority Solutions
International, a U.S.-based leading third-party logistics provider to the
pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The purchase price totaled $164
million, net of cash acquired and a $1 million post-closing purchase price
refund received in 2008. The acquisition broadened the segment’s clinical trials
management services offerings. Revenues of Priority Solutions totaled $96
million in 2006. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net
assets and, accordingly, $107 million was allocated to goodwill, $37 million of
which is tax deductible.

In October 2007, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment acquired NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a
U.S.-based supplier of UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific
instruments to the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The purchase
price totaled $156 million, net of cash acquired and including $12 million of
payments made in 2008 and $15 million due in 2009. Of the $12 million of
payments made in 2008, $10 million represented contingent consideration earned
for achievement of specified operating results in 2007 and $2 million
represented a post-closing purchase price adjustment. Of the $15 million due in
2009, $8 million represents deferred purchase price and $7 million represents
contingent consideration payable for the achievement of specified operating
results in 2008. In addition, the purchase agreement calls for additional
contingent consideration of up to $10 million based on the successful approval
of certain pending patent applications. The acquisition broadened the segment’s
technology offerings. Revenues of NanoDrop totaled $27 million in 2006. The
purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and,
accordingly, $76 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax
deductible.

In December 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired La-Pha-Pack, a European-based
manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories.
The purchase price totaled $50 million, net of cash acquired, and included $4
million of contingent consideration based upon 2008 operating results which was
earned and accrued as an obligation at December 31, 2008 through an increase to
goodwill. The acquisition broadened the segment’s chromatography consumables
offerings and expanded its geographic coverage in Europe. Revenues of
La-Pha-Pack totaled $21 million in 2006. The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $12 million was allocated to
goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition to the acquisitions
described above, in 2007 the Analytical Technologies segment acquired a
distributor of mass spectrometry, chromatography and surface science
instruments, a manufacturer of high performance liquid chromatography pumps and
software, a manufacturer of electrostatic discharge products, the intellectual
property of a diagnostics business and the assets of a water testing business.
The Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired a provider of test,
measurement and process control instruments, an independent test and research
laboratory, a developer of liquid handling pipette tips and a cell culture
product line. The total aggregate consideration was $88 million, net of cash
acquired. The company also paid transaction costs and post-closing and
contingent purchase price adjustments aggregating $11 million in 2007 for
various acquisitions completed prior to 2007. The company obtained a refund of
$5 million in 2007 related to a post-closing adjustment for a 2006
acquisition.

2006 Merger with Fisher Scientific
International Inc.

Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher
Scientific International Inc. announced on May 8, 2006 that the boards of
directors of both companies had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to
combine the two companies in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher
businesses are a leading provider of products and services

to the
scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses
provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from
biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to
rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher
had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. The transaction was approved by both
companies’ shareholders, in separate meetings, held on August 30, 2006 and,
following regulatory approvals, was completed on November 9, 2006. The results
of the operations of Fisher have been included in the results of the company
from the date of acquisition. Following the merger, the company was renamed
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement,
Fisher shareholders received two shares of company common stock for each share
of Fisher common stock they owned. Based on the average closing price for the
two trading days before and after the announcement date of $38.93 per share,
this exchange represented a value of $77.86 per Fisher share, or an aggregate
equity value of $10.28 billion. The company also assumed Fisher’s debt ($2.28
billion). The merger enabled the two companies to broaden their customer
offerings to include a full range of analytical instruments, equipment, reagents
and consumables, software and services for research, analysis, discovery and
diagnostics.

Upon completion of the transaction,
Thermo’s shareholders owned approximately 39 percent of the combined company,
and Fisher’s shareholders owned approximately 61 percent. Based upon pre-merger
members of the company’s board of directors and senior management representing a
majority of the composition of the combined company’s board and senior
management and the Fisher shareholders receiving a premium (as of the date
preceding the merger announcement) over the fair market value of Fisher common
stock on such date, the company is considered to be the acquirer for accounting
purposes.

The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets, and accordingly, $6.5 billion was allocated to
goodwill, approximately $450 million of which is deductible for tax
purposes.

The company allocated $15 million of
the purchase price for Fisher to in-process research and development, which
represents the estimated fair value at November 9, 2006 related to in-process
projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future uses as of the date of the merger. The company recorded as
expense the value attributable to these projects at the date of the
merger.

The company uses the income approach to
determine the fair values of its purchased research and development. This
approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows
attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting
these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. In determining the value of
the in-process projects, the company considers, among other factors, the
in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed
as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to
complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the
expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. The
company bases the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date
of acquisition on the time value of money and life science technology investment
risk factors. The company believes that the estimated purchased research and
development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of
acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the
projects.

Acquisitions

In December 2006, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment acquired Cohesive Technologies Inc., a
Massachusetts-based provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid
chromatography products. The purchase price totaled $71 million in cash, net of
cash acquired. Cohesive had revenues of $14 million in 2006 through the date of
acquisition. The acquisition of Cohesive enabled the segment to broaden its
in-line sample preparation capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $33 million was allocated to
goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition to this acquisition, the
Analytical Technologies segment acquired a manufacturer of polymer web gauging
products, a provider of isotope ratio mass spectrometry instuments and a small
manufacturer of on-line elemental analyzer products, as well as a product line
and a small distributor, for aggregate consideration of $58
million.

The company’s acquisitions have
historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired assets,
resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of synergies of combining the
businesses. These synergies include elimination of redundant facilities,
functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure
to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial
infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of
company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results
have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. Allocation of the purchase price for
acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired
and, for acquisitions completed within the past year, is subject to adjustment
upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The company is not aware of
any information that indicates the final purchase price allocations will differ
materially from the preliminary estimates.

Restructuring
Activities at Acquired Businesses

The company has undertaken
restructuring activities at acquired businesses. These activities, which were
accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination,” have primarily included reductions in staffing levels and the
abandonment of excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring
activities, as part of the cost of acquisitions, the company established
reserves, primarily for severance and excess facilities. In accordance with EITF
Issue No. 95-3, the company finalizes its restructuring plans no later than one
year from the respective dates of the acquisitions. Upon finalization of
restructuring plans or settlement of obligations for less than the expected
amount, any excess reserves are reversed with a corresponding decrease in
goodwill or other intangible assets when no goodwill exists. Accrued acquisition
expenses are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance
sheet. No accrued acquisition expenses have been established for 2008
acquisitions.

management responsibility and the related financial reporting and monitoring for
several small product lines between segments. The company has historically moved
a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the
product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment
different than that in which it had previously been reported. Prior period
segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers. The
company’s segments are as follows:

Analytical Technologies: serves
research scientists, as well as customers in healthcare and clinical
laboratories, in manufacturing and in the field, with a suite of advanced
analytical technologies, including scientific instruments, robotics and software
for creating advanced integrated workflows. The segment also includes a range of
diagnostic reagents and instruments used by hospitals and reference
laboratories.

Laboratory Products and Services:
serves life science, healthcare and safety markets with a broad portfolio of
products and consumables used for routine laboratory processes, as well as a
range of biopharma outsourcing services such as clinical packaging and
biological sample management. The segment also includes the company’s extensive
customer channels network consisting of catalog, e-commerce and other sales
avenues.

The company’s management evaluates
operating segment performance based on operating income before certain charges
to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting;
restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility
consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and
losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of
stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this
measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core
operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining
compensation.

The company acquired 5,660,000 shares
of Nanogen Inc. as a result of the Fisher merger. In December 2007, the company
recorded a loss of $8.9 million on the investment in Nanogen for other than
temporary impairment following a decline in the quoted fair market value of the
shares that occurred between April and December 2007. In 2008, the company
recorded an additional loss of $1.2 million on the investment in Nanogen for
other than temporary impairment that occurred in the second half of 2008. In
addition, the company recorded a charge of $4.9 million in 2008 for other than
temporary impairment of other available-for-sale investments that decreased in
value primarily in the prior 6-9 months.

(Loss) gain on investments, net,
also includes portfolio gains from the company’s day-to-day investing
activities.

Employee
      Benefit Plans

Stock-based
Compensation Plans

The company has stock-based
compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans
permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including
restricted stock, stock options, stock bonus shares or performance-based shares,
as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors
or in limited circumstances, by the company’s option committee, which consists
of its chief executive officer. Options granted prior to July 2000 under these
plans vested over 0-10 years and had terms ranging from 3-12 years. Options
granted in or after July 2000 under these plans generally vested over 3-5 years
with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
The company practice is to grant options at fair market value. The company
generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises. The
merger with Fisher resulted in a change in control and consequently, the vesting
of substantially all of Thermo Electron’s option and restricted stock awards
accelerated except for those options of the company’s chief executive officer
who waived acceleration. As a result, substantially all shares became
immediately exercisable and shares acquired upon exercise cease to be subject to
transfer restrictions and the company’s repurchase rights. The acceleration
resulted in a pre-tax charge in 2006 of $36.7 million. Grants of stock options
and restricted stock on or after November 9, 2006, provide that upon a future
change in control of the company and qualifying termination of an option
holder’s employment, all options and time-based restricted stock awards held by
the recipient become immediately vested unless an employment or other agreement
with the employee provides for different treatment.

Effective January 1, 2006, the
company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R “Share-based Payment,”
using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this
transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January 1,
2006 includes compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
and (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the
requisite vesting period or, for 2006 and later grants, to the retirement date
for retirement eligible employees, if earlier.

      occurred as a result of the Fisher
merger.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS
No. 109 and EITF Topic D-32, “Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of
Pretax Income from Continuing Operations,” the company has elected to recognize
any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess
of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after
considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The
company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related
to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by
the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach
for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess
of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $25.1 million, $99.1 million
and $17.4 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Stock Options

— The fair
value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with
respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on
the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The average expected life of
grants through 2007 was estimated using the simplified method for “plain
vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107. Thereafter, historical data on
exercise patterns became the basis for estimating the expected life of an
option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date
of grant. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net
of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of
actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used
in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
$12.70, $14.16 and $12.40, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during the same periods was $95.4 million, $429.9 million and $224.3
million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market
value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the
option.

As a result of the merger with
Fisher, options to purchase 9,661,000 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into options to purchase 19,322,000 shares of company stock. These
options had a fair value at the merger date of $394.5 million, which was
recorded as part of the merger consideration. Of the total options issued in
connection with the merger, options to purchase 1,621,000 shares of company
common stock were not fully vested. The fair value of these options ($15.1
million) was treated as a reduction of the merger consideration and is being
recorded as compensation cost over the vesting period.

Restricted Share Awards

— The
company awards to a number of key employees restricted company common stock or
restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of common
stock assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. The awards generally
vest in equal annual installments over three years, assuming continued
employment, with some exceptions. The fair market value of the award at the time
of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of
restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends,
whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to
receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of restricted share/unit awards is
determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of
the company’s shares on the grant date.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company
granted 396,800, 62,500 and 401,900 share awards respectively, at a weighted
average fair value of $55.09, $54.97 and $42.66, respectively, per share on the
grant date.

In 2006, the company awarded certain
key employees 134,000 restricted shares of common stock, the vesting of which
was contingent upon meeting certain operating targets and stock performance. The
company is recognizing the cost of the awards over the contingent vesting
periods of 4-5 years. The actual vesting periods may be shorter if certain
performance goals are achieved. The ultimate value of the awards will be
determined when they are earned. The company established an initial value for
the awards based on the fair market value at the date of grant and marks them to
market for changes in fair market value. At December 31, 2008, 50% of the shares
were not expected to vest and, as a result, the company reversed the expense
recognized in prior periods on those shares which are not expected to vest. The
company recognized $1.7 million and $0.2 million of cost associated with the
awards in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, the company recorded a net
reversal of cost associated with these awards of $0.8 million, and at December
31, 2008, the awards expected to vest had a total value of $2.2 million. Should
the performance targets not be met, any recognized compensation cost would be
reversed.

In 2008, the company awarded certain
key employees up to 158,000 restricted shares of common stock, the vesting of
which was contingent upon 2008 operating performance. The company established a
value for the awards based on the fair market value at the date of grant of
$54.85 per share. Based on actual operating performance achieved, 135,600 of the
restricted shares are expected to vest. The company is recognizing the cost of
the awards expected to vest over the vesting periods of 1-3 years. The company
recognized $4.0 million of cost associated with these awards in
2008.

As a result of the merger with Fisher,
restricted units convertible into 468,000 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into restricted units convertible into 936,000 shares of company
stock. These restricted units had a fair value at the merger date of $36.4
million, which was recorded as part of the merger consideration. The restricted
units issued in connection with the merger were not fully vested. The fair value
of the unvested portion of these units ($29.1 million) was treated as a
reduction of the merger consideration and is being recorded as compensation cost
over the vesting period.

restricted share awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 2.0 years. The total fair value of shares vested during 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $16.7 million, $20.7 million and $7.9 million,
respectively.

Prior to 2006, the company recorded the
unrecognized compensation cost associated with restricted stock awards as a
separate account within shareholders equity. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R
in 2006, the balance of the deferred compensation was eliminated against capital
in excess of par value on the balance sheet.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying employees are eligible to
participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares
may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of
the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding
period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each
participating employee’s gross wages. The company issued 124,000, 66,000 and
59,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2008, 2007 and 2006
plan years, which ended on December 31.

401(k)
Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and
other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible
U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both
the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of
employee contributions. Certain of the company’s subsidiaries offer retirement
plans in lieu of participation in the company’s 401(k) savings plans. Company
contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In
2008, 2007 and 2006, the company charged to expense $55.5 million, $56.8 million
and $26.9 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution
plans.

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of non-U.S. and
certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans
are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also
has a postretirement healthcare program in which certain employees are eligible
to participate. The costs of the healthcare program are funded on a self-insured
and insured-premium basis.

Effective December 31, 2006, the
company adopted SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefits
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106 and 132R.” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded
status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an
asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair
value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) that arise but were
not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later
recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

In accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” when an employer is acquired
as part of a merger, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan
assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the
projected benefit obligation is recognized as a plan asset. The recognition of a
new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously
existing unrecognized net gain or loss, (b) unrecognized prior service cost and
(c) unrecognized net transition obligation. Fisher’s pension obligations were
recorded by the company at the date of merger pursuant to these rules. The
funding of Fisher’s plans is not directly affected by the merger.

The company funds annually, at a
minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company made contributions of approximately
$20.7 million, $54.2 million and $50.3 million, respectively. Contributions are
estimated at between $20 and $30 million for 2009.

The discount rate reflects the rate the
company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would
provide cash sufficient to settle its current

pension
obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors,
including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and
the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the
company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with
maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate
the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds
invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the
projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan
assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset
classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition,
the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other
professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

Asset management objectives include
maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and
market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future
benefit payment requirements.

The expected rate of compensation
increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on
historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future
salary increases.

The amounts in accumulated other
comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic
benefit cost in 2009 are as follows:

The company receives a tax deduction
upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference
between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock
on the date of exercise. The provision for income taxes that is currently
payable does not reflect $25.1 million, $99.1 million and $17.4 million of such
benefits of the company that have been allocated to capital in excess of par
value in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The provision for income taxes in the

deferred income taxes resulting from a change in the apportionment of state tax
rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. During 2007, the
company recorded an income tax benefit of $31.6 million, net, principally due to
a reduction in deferred income taxes as a result of tax law changes in the
United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany.

The company estimates the degree to
which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on
expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance
for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more
likely than not go unused. At the time of the merger with Fisher in November
2006, the company established a $41.9 million valuation allowance for foreign
tax credit carryforwards that it did not expect would be used based on the
combined company’s tax position. During 2008, the company reduced its valuation
allowance for the foreign tax credit carryforwards by $41.9 million, all of
which reduced goodwill, due to an expectation that the benefit will be realized.
At December 31, 2008, $161.4 million of the company’s valuation allowance
relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax
benefits will reduce income tax expense following the adoption of SFAS No.
141(R).

At December 31, 2008, the company had
federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $176.6 million,
$635.3 million and $556.0 million, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is
limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2009 through 2028. Of
the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $158.6 million expire in the
years 2009 through 2028, and the remainder do not expire. The company also had
$97.7 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31,
2008, which expire in the years 2009 through 2018.

A provision has not been made for
U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $2.72 billion of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the
U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested
overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the
U.S. without an associated net tax cost.

Adoption
of FASB Interpretation No. 48

The company adopted the provisions
of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the
company recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits. As of the adoption date of January 1, 2007, the company had $82.4
million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $33.2 million, if recognized,
would reduce the effective tax rate and the remaining $49.2 million, if
recognized, would have decreased goodwill. As of December 31, 2008, the company
had $70.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would
reduce the effective tax rate following adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) in
2009.

The company classified interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total
amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and
recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $5.3
million for interest.

The company conducts business globally
and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income
tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to
examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major
jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the
company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years before 2001.

During 2008, the statute of limitations
on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $3.0 million
decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which reduced
goodwill. During 2007, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax
benefits lapsed which resulted in a $2.3 million decrease in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, $2.0 million of which reduced goodwill and $0.3
million of which reduced income tax expense.

In 2008, the company settled IRS audits
of the 2004 and 2005 pre-acquisition tax years of Fisher, which resulted in a $7
million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill.
This decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was substantially
offset by an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits related to the sale of a
non-U.S. subsidiary. During 2007, the company settled audits of the 2003
pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries which resulted in a
$2.6 million decrease in both the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and
goodwill. The company also settled audits of the 1994-1997 tax years of certain
German subsidiaries which resulted in a $7.1 million decrease in both the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill. The company is currently
under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 to 2004 tax years. The
examination of those years is at the appeals level of the IRS. The company does
not currently expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized
tax benefits. The company is also currently under audit by the IRS for the 2006
and 2007 tax years and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher
subsidiaries. It is likely that the examination phase of these audits will be
completed within twelve months. There have been no significant changes to the
status of these examinations during 2008, and the company does not currently
expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax
benefits.

Options to purchase 3.6 million, 3.7

computation of diluted earnings per share for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Under EITF No. 04-08 “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” and EITF
No. 90-19 “Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon
Conversion,” because of the company’s obligation to settle the par value of its
convertible notes in cash, the company is not required to include any shares
underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares
outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the
$23.73, $29.55, and $40.20 conversion price for the 2.50% Senior Convertible
Notes due 2023, the Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 and the
3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024, respectively, and only to
the extent of the additional shares the company may be required to issue in the
event the company’s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the
notes or debentures converted (Note 9). At such time, only the number of shares
that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share
dilution) are included, which is based upon the amount by which the average
stock price exceeds the conversion price.

The table below discloses the effect of
changes in the company’s stock price on the amount of shares to be included in
the earnings per share calculation. The securities are convertible only if the
common stock price equals or exceeds the trigger price. The table assumes normal
conversion for the 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due

See Note 12 for fair value
information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations.

Short-term obligations and current
maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included
$11.3 million and $11.4 million at year-end 2008 and 2007, respectively, of
short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of
the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term
borrowings was 1.63% and 1.75% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In
addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements
and a money market loan fund arrangement, all discussed below, the company had
unused lines of credit of $124.5 million as of December 31, 2008. These unused
lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various
interest rates.

On November 9, 2006, in connection
with the merger with Fisher, the company entered into a new $1 billion
multi-currency credit facility, discussed below. The company used proceeds from
this facility to prepay Fisher debt. The company also terminated its $250
million revolving credit and 175 million euro credit facilities. There were no
outstanding balances when those facilities were terminated.

In connection with the Fisher
merger, the company assumed three issuances of convertible debt as well as two
issuances of fixed-rate debt, described below. The company became a co-obligor
of this debt. The debt was recorded at the merger date at its fair value. The
excess of the fair value over the principal value of the convertible debt, or
$546.8 million, was deemed to arise from the value of the conversion features
and was allocated to capital in excess of par value.

On December 15, 2006, the company
provided a notice to the holders of the 3.25% subordinated convertible
debentures due 2007 that the debentures would be redeemed on January 5, 2007.
The holders’ right to convert the debentures into common shares of the company
expired on December 28, 2006. The holders of $69.8 million in aggregate
principal amount converted their debentures into common shares. On January 5,
2007, the remaining debentures totaling $7.4 million in aggregate principal
amount were redeemed at par plus accrued interest.

Credit
Facilities

In November 2006, the company entered
into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a bank
group that provides for up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving
credit that will expire in August 2012. The agreement calls for interest at
either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent
bank, at the company’s option. The rate at December 31, 2008, was between 0.66%
and 2.02% (depending on duration) under the more favorable of the two rates. The
Revolving Credit Facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which
reduces the amount available for borrowing. The agreement contains affirmative,
negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings
of this type. The financial covenant requires the company to maintain total
leverage below a certain maximum level. The credit agreement permits the company
to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common
stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under the
revolver and $50.2 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $949.8
million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

Money
Market Loans

The company has an uncommitted line of
credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans
funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans
typically have maturity periods of between one and three months, however they
can have longer durations as the market will bear. Furthermore, they bear
varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time
of issuance. As of December 31, 2008, the company did not have any outstanding
borrowings under this line.

Debt
      and Other Financing Arrangements
(continued)

Should any of the company’s convertible
obligations be converted or if such debt is put to the company by holders on the
next put dates in 2010 and 2011, the company currently intends to finance the
cash payments that would be payable through borrowings under its revolving
credit agreement

5%
Senior Notes due 2015

The company has $250 million principal
amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on June 1
and December 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole
premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and
negative covenants.

Prior to issuing this debt, the company
entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks to
mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt
offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable
and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year
term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate
interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed-rate
debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The change in the fair
value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax, and was
classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within
shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of
the debt through 2015.

5/8% Senior Notes due 2008

The company had $128.7 million
principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2008. Interest on the notes was
payable on April 30 and October 30 of each year. The principal and accrued
interest on these notes was paid in full in 2008.

3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014

At the closing date of the merger with
Fisher, the company assumed $300 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and
August 15 of each year. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the
company’s option, on or after August 15, 2009, at specified redemption prices
plus accrued interest. At any period prior to August 15, 2009, the company may
redeem the notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a
specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. If a change of control
occurs and the notes fail to maintain at least a BBB- rating by S&P and a
Baa3 rating by Moody’s, each holder of notes may require the company to
repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest.

1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015

At the closing date of the merger with
Fisher, the company assumed $500 million principal amount of 6 1/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on January 1 and
July 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the

Operating
Leases

The company leases certain
logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities. Income from continuing
operations includes expense from operating leases of $108.8 million, $97.0
million and $48.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following is
a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2008:

Purchase
Obligations

The company has entered into
unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that
include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and
legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions;
and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude
agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount
of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $162.5 million at
December 31, 2008 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be
settled during 2009.

Letters
of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding letters of credit and bank
guarantees totaled $101.5 million at December 31, 2008, including $3.3 million
for businesses that have been sold. The expiration of these credits and
guarantees ranges through 2030.

Outstanding surety bonds and other
guarantees totaled $34.9 million at December 31, 2008. The expiration of these
bonds and guarantees ranges through 2011.

The letters of credit, bank guarantees
and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the
holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank
guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as
contractually required.

In connection with the sale of
businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual
obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with
respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a
transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer
defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be
liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the
company would be entitled to indemnification by the buyer.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

The company has funding commitments
totaling $10.5 million at December 31, 2008, related to investments it
owns.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain
transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the
other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that
were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain
environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of
such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where
appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than
obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the
company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s
efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has
vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the
company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor
under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if
a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to
make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company
believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in
the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of
operations.

In connection with the sale of products
in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations
affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against
third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to
make material payments under such provisions.

Litigation
and Related Contingencies

On September 3, 2004, Applera
Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments filed a
lawsuit against the company in U.S. federal court. These plaintiffs allege that
the company’s mass spectrometer systems, including its triple quadrupole and
certain of its ion trap systems, infringe a patent of the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs seek damages, including treble damages for alleged willful
infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive relief. In
the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a
material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its
results of operations and cash flows.

On December 8, 2004 and February 23,
2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits against a combination of Applera
Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments that one
or more of these parties infringe two patents of the company.

There are various other lawsuits and
claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract,
commercial and other issues. In view of the company’s financial condition and
the accruals established for related matters, management does not believe that
the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

The company establishes a liability
that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events
that have already occurred. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s
judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially
determined estimates. The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional
information becomes known or payments are made.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

The company accrues the most likely
amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of
probable loss can be estimated. The range of probable loss for product
liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the
company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2008, was approximately $219
million to $335 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these
liabilities assumed in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present)
value at the date of merger. The company’s reserve for these matters in total,
including the discounted Fisher liabilities, was $154 million at December 31,
2008 (or $225 million undiscounted). The reserve includes estimated defense
costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $82 million at
December 31, 2008 (or $125 million undiscounted). The portion of these insurance
assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at
the date of merger. In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2008,
the company had product liability reserves of $9 million (undiscounted) relating
to divested businesses.

The assets and liabilities assumed at
the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of
expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free
rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted
average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of
approximately $71 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $43
million (net discount $28 million) are being accreted to interest expense over
the expected settlement period.

Although the company believes that the
amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on
available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the
process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable
degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
For example, there are pending lawsuits with certain of Fisher’s insurers
concerning which state’s laws should apply to the insurance policies and how
such laws affect the policies. Should these actions resolve unfavorably, the
estimated amount due from insurers of $82 million would require adjustment that
could be material to the company’s results of operations. Insurance contracts do
not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses
incurred. The collectibility of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the
solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency
of the insurance claims. Management monitors the financial condition and ratings
of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

The company is currently involved in
various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental
matters, principally at businesses acquired in the merger with Fisher. The
company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation
matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties
regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup
methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for
environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements
and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and
other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at
the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any
period presented. The company’s liability for environmental matters associated
with businesses acquired in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair
value and as such, was discounted to its present value. The company records
accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current
interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably
estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors,
including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s
knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company
includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and
operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Having assumed these environmental
liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the
estimate of loss to fair (present) value, $23 million. This fair value was
ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest
rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental
liability. The discount of $10.0 million is being accreted by charges to
interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years. At December 31,
2008 and 2007, the environmental liability was approximately $20 million and $23
million, respectively.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

Management believes that its reserves
for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the company
expects to incur. As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability
with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or
compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and
regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments
in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although these
environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the
company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for
liabilities relating to certain sites.

Common
      and Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2008, the company
had reserved 81,033,128 unissued shares of its common stock for possible
issuance under stock-based compensation plans and for possible conversion of the
company’s convertible debentures.

The company has 50,000 shares of
authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.

The company has distributed rights
under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to
holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles
the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of
$200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until
the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a
person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii)
10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In the event that a person becomes
the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,
except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at
least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in
the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the
Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of
preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals
the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price
of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become
an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving
corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger
that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or
more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each
holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the
right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by
one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

At any time until the Stock Acquisition
Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of
$.01 per right (payable in cash or stock). The rights expire on September 29,
2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.

As a result of the merger with
Fisher, warrants to purchase 1,653,585 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into warrants to purchase 3,307,170 shares of company common stock at
an exercise price of $4.83 per share. These warrants had a fair value of $113.2
million at the merger date, which was recorded as part of the merger
consideration. All of the outstanding warrants were exercised in January
2008.

Fair
      Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial
  Instruments

Fair
Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements. This statement does not require any
new fair value measurements.

On January 1, 2008, the company adopted
SFAS No. 157 as it pertains to financial assets and liabilities. In accordance
with the provisions of FASB Staff Position 157-2, the company elected to defer
the adoption of SFAS No. 157 relating to the fair values of non-financial assets
and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a nonrecurring basis until January 1, 2009. The company does not
believe the impact of adopting the fair value guidance outlined in SFAS No. 157
to its non-financial assets and liabilities will have a material impact on its
financial statements.

The company uses the market approach
technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in
valuation techniques during 2008. The company’s financial assets and liabilities
carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in money market
funds, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities, derivative contracts
used to hedge the company’s currency risk and other investments in unit trusts
and insurance contracts held as assets to satisfy outstanding retirement
liabilities.

SFAS No. 157 requires that assets and
liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the
following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to
access.

Level 2: Observable market based inputs
or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted
prices, interest rates, and yield curves.

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data
points that are not corroborated by market data.

The cost of available-for-sale
investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining
realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. The
net gain on the sale of available-for-sale investments resulted from gross
realized gains of $0.6 million and $0.7 million in 2008 and 2006, respectively,
and gross realized losses of $4.0 million and $9.0 million in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

In addition to available-for-sale
investments, the company had $0.8 million and $2.0 million of trading
securities, consisting of debt and equity securities, at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

The company determines the fair value
of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from
brokers/dealers. During 2008, the company recorded in other expense, net, a $2.3
million impairment charge on the auction rate securities for a decline in value
exceeding six to nine months duration and thus considered other-than-temporary.

Restructuring
      and Other Costs, Net

Restructuring costs in 2008 included
reductions in headcount within several businesses due to economic uncertainty
affecting end markets and consolidating or transferring manufacturing operations
from various sites in Europe, the U.S. and Australia to other sites. The 2008
costs also included charges for asset impairment, litigation and other matters
discussed by segment below, net of pension curtailment gains. Restructuring
costs in 2007 included charges for the consolidation of anatomical pathology
operations in Pennsylvania with a site in Michigan, as well as consolidation of
other U.S. operations and consolidation of sites in the UK and France with
plants in Germany. Restructuring costs recorded in 2006 included charges to
close a plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an
acquired Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for consolidation of a U.K.
facility into an existing factory in Germany, the move of manufacturing
operations in New Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe and remaining
costs of prior actions.

The Analytical Technologies segment
recorded $42.3 million of net restructuring and other charges in 2008. The
segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.7 million, primarily for
accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation,
and $41.6 million of other costs, net. These other costs consisted of $23.1
million of cash costs, principally associated with headcount reductions and
facility consolidations, including $13.7 million of severance for approximately
500 employees across all functions; $6.0 million of abandoned-facility costs;
and $3.4 million of other cash costs, primarily retention, relocation, moving
expenses and contract termination costs associated with facility consolidations.
The principal facility consolidations include consolidating bioprocess
production operations into a new facility at a current site in Utah as well as
continuing actions initiated prior to 2008 and beginning new actions to cease
manufacturing activities at plants in New Mexico, Denmark and Australia and
transfer their operations to other sites. The segment also recorded non-cash
costs of $18.5 million, including a $7.0 million impairment of
acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit
acquired as part of Fisher in 2006, a $5.0 million loss from a
litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $2.9
million net loss on the sale of businesses, $2.6 million for in-process research
and development associated with an acquisition and $1.0 million for asset write
downs at abandoned facilities.

Laboratory Products and
Services

The Laboratory Products and Services

Discontinued
      Operations

In 2008, the company recorded
additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related
to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million.
The note was collected in July 2008.

Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of
GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Competition Commission initiated an
investigation of the transaction and concluded that the acquisition would lead
to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in certain markets. The
Competition Commission further concluded that a divestiture remedy was
appropriate and required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its
principal product lines to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As
a result of this divestiture requirement, the company recorded after-tax
impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents
non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated
disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this
business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the
historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In
February 2008, the company completed the sale.

Aside from the impairment loss related
to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in
2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional
proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s
estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business.

During 2006, the company committed to a
plan to dispose of Genevac Limited (Genevac), a legacy Fisher business that is a
manufacturer of solvent evaporation technology. The decision followed the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) consent order that required divesture of Genevac
for FTC approval of the Thermo Fisher merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act. Genevac was sold in April 2007, for net proceeds of
$21 million in cash. The results of discontinued operations also include the
results of Systems Manufacturing Corporation (SMC), a legacy Fisher business
that provides consoles, workstations and server enclosures for information
technology operations and data centers. SMC was sold in July 2007 for cash
proceeds of $2.5 million. The operating results of Genevac and SMC were not
material for the 2007 period prior to their sale. The assets and liabilities of
these entities were not material at December 31, 2006. For the period from
November 9, 2006 through December 31, 2006, these entities had net income of
$0.5 million which is classified as income from discontinued operations in the
accompanying statement of income.

The company had $2.1 million of gains
from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2006, including primarily
additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a
charge for settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested
business.
